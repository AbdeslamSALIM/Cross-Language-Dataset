Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products 
Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 6 November 2001 
on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(1), 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(2), 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Directive 81/851/EEC of 28 September 1981 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to veterinary medicinal products(3), Council Directive 81/852/EEC of 28 September 1981 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to analytical, pharmaco-toxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of veterinary medicinal products(4), Council Directive 90/677/EEC of 13 December 1990 extending the scope of Directive 81/851/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to veterinary medicinal products and laying down additional provisions for immunological veterinary medicinal products(5), and Council Directive 92/74/EEC of 22 September 1992 widening the scope of Directive 81/851/EEC on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to veterinary medicinal products and laying down additional provisions on homeopathic veterinary medicinal products(6) have been frequently and substantially amended; in the interests of clarity and rationality, the said Directives should therefore be codified by assembling them in a single text. 
(2) The primary purpose of any rules for the production and distribution of veterinary medicinal products must be the safeguarding of public health. 
(3) However, this objective must be achieved by means which will not hinder the development of industry and trade in medicinal products within the Community. 
(4) In so far as the Member States already have certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action governing veterinary medicinal products, such provisions differ in essential principles. This results in the hindering of trade in medicinal products within the Community, thereby directly affecting the functioning of the internal market. 
(5) Such hindrances must, accordingly, be removed; whereas this entails approximation of the relevant provisions. 
(6) It is necessary from the point of view of public health and the free movement of veterinary medicinal products for the competent authorities to have at their disposal all useful information on authorized veterinary medicinal products in the form of approved summaries of the characteristics of products. 
(7) With the exception of those medicinal products which are subject to the centralised Community authorization procedure established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 of 22 July 1993 laying down Community procedures for the authorization and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products(7), a marketing authorization in one Member State ought to be recognized by the competent authority of the other Member States unless there are serious grounds for supposing that the authorization of the veterinary medicinal product concerned may present a risk to human or animal health, or to the environment; in the event of a disagreement between Member States about the quality, the safety or the efficacy of a medicinal product, a scientific evaluation of the matter should be undertaken at a Community level, lead to a single decision on the area of disagreement, binding on the Member States concerned. This Decision should be adopted by a rapid procedure ensuring close cooperation between the Commission and the Member States. 
(8) For this purpose, a Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products should be set up in accordance with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products laid down in the aforementioned Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93. 
(9) This Directive is only one stage in the achievement of the aim of freedom of movement of veterinary medicinal products. However, for this purpose, new measures will prove necessary, in the light of experience gained - especially within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products - for the removal of the remaining barriers to freedom of movement. 
(10) Medicated feedingstuffs do not come within the scope of this Directive. However, it is necessary, for both public health and economic reasons, to prohibit the use of unauthorized medicinal products in the manufacture of medicated feedingstuffs. 
(11) The concepts of harmfulness and therapeutic efficacy can be examined only in relation to one another and have only a relative significance, depending on the progress of scientific knowledge and the use for which the medicinal product is intended. The particulars and documents which must accompany an application for marketing authorization must demonstrate that potential hazards are outweighed by the benefits due to efficacy. Failing such demonstration, the application must be rejected. 
(12) Marketing authorization should be refused where a medicinal product lacks therapeutic effect or where there is insufficient proof of such effect. The concept of therapeutic effect must be understood as being the effect promised by the manufacturers. 
(13) Such marketing authorization should also be refused where the withdrawal period indicated is not long enough to eliminate health hazards arising from residues. 
(14) Before an authorization to market an immunological veterinary medicinal product can be granted, the manufacturer must demonstrate his ability to attain batch-to-batch consistency. 
(15) The competent authorities should also be empowered to prohibit the use of an immunological veterinary medicinal product when the immunological responses of the treated animal will interfere with a national or Community programme for the diagnosis, eradication or control of animal disease. 
(16) It is desirable in the first instance to provide users of homeopathic medicinal products with a very clear indication of their homeopathic character and with sufficient guarantees of their quality and safety. 
(17) The rules relating to the manufacture, control and inspection of homeopathic veterinary medicinal products must be harmonised to permit the circulation throughout the Community of medicinal products which are safe and of good quality. 
(18) Having regard to the particular characteristics of these homeopathic veterinary medicinal products, such as the very low level of active principles they contain and the difficulty of applying to them the conventional statistical methods relating to clinical trials, it is desirable to provide a special, simplified registration procedure for those traditional homeopathic medicinal products which are placed on the market without therapeutic indications in a pharmaceutical form and dosage which do not present a risk for the animal. 
(19) The usual rules governing the authorization to market veterinary medicinal products must be applied to homeopathic veterinary medicinal products marketed with therapeutic indications or in a form which may present risks which must be balanced against the desired therapeutic effect. Member States should be able to apply particular rules for the evaluation of the results of tests and trials intended to establish the safety and efficacy of these medicinal products for pet animals and exotic species, provided that they notify them to the Commission. 
(20) In order to better protect human and animal health and avoid any unnecessary duplication of effort during the examination of application for a marketing authorization, Member States should systematically prepare assessment reports in respect of each veterinary medicinal product which is authorized by them, and exchange the reports upon request. Furthermore, a Member State should be able to suspend the examination of an application for authorization to place a veterinary medicinal product on the market which is currently under active consideration in another Member State with a view to recognizing the decision reached by the latter Member State. 
(21) In order to facilitate the movement of veterinary medicinal products and to prevent the checks carried out in one Member State from being repeated in another, minimum requirements for manufacture and imports from third countries, and the grant of corresponding authorizations, should be applied to veterinary medicinal products. 
(22) The quality of veterinary medicinal products manufactured within the Community should be guaranteed by requiring compliance with the principles of good manufacturing practice for medicinal products irrespective of the final destination of the medicinal products. 
(23) Measures should also be taken to ensure that distributors of veterinary medicinal products are authorized by Member States and maintain adequate records. 
(24) Standards and protocols for the performance of tests and trials on veterinary medicinal products are an effective means of control of these products and, hence, of protecting public health and can facilitate the movement of these products by laying down uniform rules applicable to tests and the compilation of dossiers, allowing the competent authorities to arrive at their decisions on the basis of uniform tests and by reference to uniform criteria, and therefore helping to obviate differences in evaluation. 
(25) It is advisable to stipulate more precisely the cases in which the results of pharmacological and toxicological tests or clinical trials do not have to be provided with a view to obtaining authorization for a veterinary medicinal product which is essentially similar to an innovative product, while ensuring that innovative forms are not placed at a disadvantage. However, there are reasons of public policy for not repeating tests carried out on animals without overriding cause. 
(26) Following the establishment of the internal market, specific controls to guarantee the quality of veterinary medicinal products imported from third countries can be waived only if appropriate arrangements have been made by the Community to ensure that the necessary controls are carried out in the exporting country. 
(27) In order to ensure the continued safety of veterinary medicinal products in use, it is necessary to ensure that pharmacovigilance systems in the Community are continually adapted to take account of scientific and technical progress. 
(28) For public health protection, relevant data on adverse effects in humans related to the use of veterinary medicines should be collected and evaluated. 
(29) The pharmacovigilance systems should consider the available data on lack of efficacy. 
(30) In addition, collection of information on adverse reactions due to off-label use, investigations of the validity of the withdrawal period and on potential environmental problems may contribute to improve regular monitoring of good usage of veterinary medicines. 
(31) It is necessary to take account of changes arising as a result of international harmonisation of definitions, terminology and technological developments in the field of pharmacovigilance. 
(32) The increasing use of electronic means of communication of information on adverse reactions to veterinary medicinal products marketed in the Community is intended to allow a single reporting point for adverse reactions, at the same time ensuring that this information is shared with the competent authorities in all Member States. 
(33) It is the interest of the Community to ensure that the veterinary pharmacovigilance systems for centrally authorised medicinal products and those authorised by other procedures are consistent. 
(34) Holders of marketing authorisations should be proactively responsible for ongoing pharmacovigilance of the veterinary medicinal products they place on the market. 
(35) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8). 
(36) In order to improve the protection of public health, it is necessary to specify that foodstuffs for human consumption may not be taken from animals which have been used in clinical trials of veterinary medicinal products unless a maximum residue limit has been laid down for residues of the veterinary medicinal product concerned in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin(9). 
(37) The Commission should be empowered to adopt the changes necessary in order to adapt Annex I to scientific and technical progress. 
(38) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States concerning the time-limits for transposition of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

CHAPTER 2 
Particular provisions applicable to homeopathic veterinary medicinal products 
Article 16 
1. Member States shall ensure that homeopathic veterinary medicinal products manufactured and marketed within the Community are registered or authorized in accordance with the provisions of Articles 17(1) and (2), 18 and 19. Each Member State shall take due account of registrations and authorizations previously granted by another Member State. 
2. A Member State may refrain from establishing a special, simplified registration procedure for the homeopathic veterinary medicinal products referred to in Article 17(1) and (2). A Member State applying this provision shall inform the Commission accordingly. The Member State concerned shall, by 31 December 1995 at the latest, allow use in its territory of homeopathic veterinary medicinal products registered by other Member States in accordance with Article 17(1) and (2) and Article 18. 
Article 17 
1. Only homeopathic veterinary medicinal products which satisfy all of the following conditions may be subject to authorization by means of a special, simplified registration procedure: 
- they are intended for administration to pet animals or exotic species which are non food-producing, 
- they are administered by a route described in the European Pharmacopoeia or, in absence thereof, by the pharmacopoeias currently used officially in the Member States, 
- no specific therapeutic indication appears on the labelling of the veterinary medicinal product or in any information relating thereto, 
- there is a sufficient degree of dilution to guarantee the safety of the medicinal product; in particular, the medicinal product may not contain either more than one part per 10000 of the mother tincture or more than 1/100th of the smallest dose used in allopathy with regard to active principles whose presence in an allopathic medicinal product results in the obligation to submit a veterinary prescription. 
At the time of registration, Member States shall determine the classification for the dispensing of the medicinal product. 
2. The criteria and rules of procedure provided for in Chapter 3, with the exception of Article 25, shall apply by analogy to the special, simplified registration procedure for homeopathic veterinary medicinal products referred to in paragraph 1, with the exception of the proof of therapeutic effect. 
3. The proof of therapeutic effect shall not be required for homeopathic veterinary medicinal products registered in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article or, where appropriate, admitted in accordance with Article 16(2). 
Article 18 
A special, simplified application for registration may cover a series of medicinal products derived from the same homeopathic stock or stocks. The following documents shall be included with the application in order to demonstrate, in particular, the pharmaceutical quality and the batch-to-batch homogeneity of the products concerned: 
- scientific name or other name given in a pharmacopoeia of the homeopathic stock or stocks, together with a statement of the various routes of administration, pharmaceutical forms and degree of dilution to be registered, 
- dossier describing how the homeopathic stock or stocks is/are obtained and controlled, and justifying its/their homeopathic nature, on the basis of an adequate bibliography; in the case of homeopathic veterinary medicinal products containing biological substances, a description of the measures taken to ensure the absence of pathogens, 
- manufacturing and control file for each pharmaceutical form and a description of the method of dilution and potentiation, 
- manufacturing authorization for the medicinal products concerned, 
- copies of any registrations or authorizations obtained for the same medicinal products in other Member States, 
- one or more specimens or mock-ups of the outer packaging and immediate packaging of the medicinal products to be registered,

3. Quantitative particulars 
3.1. In order to give %quot%quantitative particulars%quot% of all the active substances of the medicinal products, it is necessary, depending on the pharmaceutical form concerned, to specify the mass, or the number of units of biological activity, either per dosage-unit or per unit of mass or volume, of each active substance. 
Units of biological activity shall be used for substances which cannot be defined chemically. Where an International Unit of biological activity has been defined by the World Health Organization, this shall be used. Where no International Unit has been defined, the units of biological activity shall be expressed in such a way as to provide unambiguous information on the activity of the substances. 
Whenever possible, biological activity per units of mass or volume shall be indicated. 
This information shall be supplemented: 
- in respect of injectable preparations, by the mass or units of biological activity of each active substance in the unit container, taking into account the usable volume of the product, after reconstitution, where appropriate, 
- in respect of medicinal products to be administered by drops, by the mass or units of biological activity of each active substance contained in the number of drops corresponding to 1 ml or 1 g of the preparation, 
- in respect of syrups, emulsions, granular preparations and other pharmaceutical forms to be administered in measured quantities, by the mass or units of biological activity of each active substance per measured quantity. 
3.2. Active substances present in the form of compounds or derivatives shall be described quantitatively by their total mass, and if necessary or relevant, by the mass of the active entity or entities of the molecule. 
3.3. For medicinal products containing an active substance which is the subject of an application for marketing authorization in any Member State for the first time, the quantitative statement of an active substance which is a salt or hydrate shall be systematically expressed in terms of the mass of the active entity or entities in the molecule. All subsequently authorized medicinal products in the Member States shall have their quantitative composition stated in the same way for the same active substance. 
4. Development pharmaceutics 
An explanation shall be provided with regard to the choice of composition, constituents and container and the intended function of the excipients in the finished product. This explanation shall be supported by scientific data on development pharmaceutics. The overage, with justification thereof, shall be stated. 
B. DESCRIPTION OF THE MANUFACTURING METHOD 
The description of the manufacturing method accompanying the application for marketing authorization pursuant to Article 12(3)(d), shall be drafted in such a way as to give an adequate synopsis of the nature of the operations employed. 
For this purpose it shall include at least: 
- mention of the various stages of manufacture, so that an assessment can be made of whether the processes employed in producing the pharmaceutical form might have produced an adverse change in the constituents, 
- in the case of continuous manufacture, full details concerning precautions taken to ensure the homogeneity of the finished product, 
- the actual manufacturing formula, with the quantitative particulars of all the substances used, the quantities of excipients, however, being given in approximate terms in so far as the pharmaceutical form makes this necessary; mention shall be made of any substances that may disappear in the course of manufacture; any overage shall be indicated and justified, 
- a statement of the stages of manufacture at which sampling is carried out for in-process control tests, where other data in the documents supporting the application show such tests to be necessary for the quality control of the finished product, 
- experimental studies validating the manufacturing process, where a non-standard method of manufacture is used or where it is critical for the product, 
- for sterile products, details of the sterilization processes and/or aseptic procedures used. 
C. CONTROL OF STARTING MATERIALS 
1. For the purposes of this paragraph, %quot%starting materials%quot% shall mean all the constituents of the medicinal product and, if necessary, of its container, as referred to in Section A, point 1, above. 
In the case of: 
- an active substance not described in the European Pharmacopoeia or in the pharmacopoeia of a Member State, 
- an active substance described in the European Pharmacopoeia or in the pharmacopoeia of a Member State when prepared by a method liable to leave impurities not mentioned in the pharmacopoeial monograph and for which the monograph is inappropriate to adequately control its quality, 
which is manufactured by a person different from the applicant, the latter may arrange for the detailed description of the manufacturing method, quality control during manufacture and process validation to be supplied directly to the competent authorities by the manufacturer of the active substance. In this case, the manufacturer shall however provide the applicant with all the data which may be necessary for the latter to take responsibility for the medicinal product. The manufacturer shall confirm in writing to the applicant that he shall ensure batch to batch consistency and not modify the manufacturing process or specifications without informing the applicant. Documents and particulars supporting the application for such a change shall be supplied to the competent authorities. 
The particulars and documents accompanying the application for marketing authorization pursuant to Article 12(3)(i) and (j) and Article 13(1), shall include the results of the tests, including batch analyses particularly for active substances, relating to quality control of all the constituents used. These shall be submitted in accordance with the following provisions. 
1.1. Starting materials listed in pharmacopoeias 
The monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia shall be applicable to all substances appearing in it. 
In respect of other substances, each Member State may require observance of its own national pharmacopoeia with regard to products manufactured in its territory. 
Constituents fulfilling the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia or the pharmacopoeia of one of the Member States shall be deemed to comply sufficiently with Article 12(3)(i). In this case the description of the analytical methods may be replaced by a detailed reference to the pharmacopoeia in question. 
However, where a starting material in the European Pharmacopoeia or in the pharmacopoeia of a Member State has been prepared by a method liable to leave impurities not controlled in the pharmacopoeia monograph, these impurities and their maximum tolerance limits must be declared and a suitable test procedure must be described. 
Colouring matter shall, in all cases, satisfy the requirements of Council Directive 78/25/EEC. 
The routine tests carried out on each batch of starting materials must be as stated in the application for marketing authorization. If tests other than those mentioned in the pharmacopoeia are used, proof must be supplied that the starting materials meet the quality requirements of that pharmacopoeia. 
In cases where a specification contained in a monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia or in the national pharmacopoeia of a Member State might be insufficient to ensure the quality of the substance, the competent authorities may request more appropriate specifications from the marketing authorization holder. 
The competent authorities shall inform the authorities responsible for the pharmacopoeia in question. The marketing authorization holder shall provide the authorities of that pharmacopoeia with the details of the alleged insufficiency and the additional specifications applied. 
In cases where a starting material is described neither in the European Pharmacopoeia nor in the pharmacopoeia of a Member State, compliance with the monograph of a third country pharmacopoeia can be accepted; in such cases, the applicant shall submit a copy of the monograph accompanied where necessary by the validation of the test procedures contained in the monograph and by a translation where appropriate. 
1.2. Starting materials not in a pharmacopoeia 
Constituents which are not given in any pharmacopoeia shall be described in the form of a monograph under the following headings: 
(a) the name of the substance, meeting the requirements of Section A point 2, shall be supplemented by any trade or scientific synonyms; 
(b) the definition of the substance, set down in a form similar to that used in the European Pharmacopoeia, shall be accompanied by any necessary explanatory evidence, especially concerning the molecular structure where appropriate; it must be accompanied by an appropriate description of the method of synthesis. Where substances can only be described by their manufacturing method, the description shall be sufficiently detailed to characterise a substance which is constant both on its composition and in its effects; 
(c) methods of identification may be described in the form of complete techniques as used for production of the substance, and in the form of tests which ought to be carried out as a routine matter; 
(d) purity tests shall be described in relation to the sum total of predictable impurities, especially those which may have a harmful effect, and, if necessary, those which, having regard to the combination of substances to which the application refers, might adversely affect the stability of the medicinal product or distort analytical results; 
(e) with regard to complex substances of plant or animal origin, a distinction must be made between the case where multiple pharmacological effects render chemical, physical or biological control of the principal components necessary, and the case of substances containing one or more groups of principles having similar activity, in respect of which an overall method of assay may be accepted; 
(f) when materials of animal origin are used, measures to ensure freedom from potentially pathogenic agents shall be described; 
(g) any special precautions that may be necessary during storage of the starting material and, if necessary, the maximum period of storage before retesting shall be given. 
1.3. Physico-chemical characteristics liable to affect bioavailability 
The following items of information concerning active substances, whether or not listed in the pharmacopoeias, shall be provided as part of the general description of the active substances if the bio-availability of the medicinal product depends on them: 
- crystalline form and solubility coefficients, 
- particle size, where appropriate after pulverization, 
- state of solvation, 
- oil/water coefficient of partition(3). 
The first three indents are not applicable to substances used solely in solution. 
2. Where source materials such as micro-organisms, tissues of either plant or animal origin, cells or fluids (including blood) of human or animal origin or biotechnological cell constructs are used in the manufacture of veterinary medicinal products, the origin and history of starting materials shall be described and documented. 
The description of the starting material shall include the manufacturing strategy, purification/inactivation procedures with their validation and all in-process control procedures designed to ensure the quality, safety and batch to batch consistency of the finished product. 
2.1. When cell banks are used, the cell characteristics shall be shown to have remained unchanged at the passage level used for the production and beyond. 
2.2. Seed materials, cell banks, pools of serum and other material of biological origin and, whenever possible, the source materials from which they are derived shall be tested for adventitious agents. 
If the presence of potentially pathogenic adventitious agents is inevitable, the material shall be used only when further processing ensures their elimination and/or inactivation, and this shall be validated. 
D. SPECIFIC MEASURES CONCERNING THE PREVENTION OF THE TRANSMISSION OF ANIMAL SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHIES 
The applicant must demonstrate that the veterinary medical product is manufactured in accordance with the Note for Guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via veterinary medicinal products and its updates, published by the European Commission in Volume 7 of its publication %quot%The rules governing medicinal products in the European Community%quot%. 
E. CONTROL TESTS CARRIED OUT AT INTERMEDIATE STAGES OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS 
The particulars and documents accompanying an application for marketing authorization, pursuant to Article 12(3)(i) and (j) and also Article 13(1), shall include particulars relating to the product control tests that may be carried out at an intermediate stage of the manufacturing process, with a view to ensuring the consistency of the technical characteristics and the production process. 
These tests are essential for checking the conformity of the medicinal product with the formula when, exceptionally, an applicant proposes an analytical method for testing the finished product which does not include the assay of all the active substances (or of all the excipient components subject to the same requirements as the active substances). 
The same applies where the quality control of the finished product depends on in-process control tests, particularly if the substance is essentially defined by its manufacturing method. 
F. TESTS ON THE FINISHED PRODUCT 
1. For the control of the finished product, a batch of a finished product comprises all the units of a pharmaceutical form which are made from the same initial quantity of material and have undergone the same series of manufacturing and/or sterilization operations or, in the case of a continuous production process, all the units manufactured in a given period of time. 
The application for marketing authorization shall list those tests which are carried out routinely on each batch of finished product. The frequency of the tests which are not carried out routinely shall be stated. Release limits shall be indicated. 
The particulars and documents accompanying the application for marketing authorization pursuant to Article 12(3)(i) and (j) and also Article 13(1), shall include particulars relating to control tests on the finished product at release. They shall be submitted in accordance with the following requirements. 
The provisions of the general monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia, or failing that, of a Member State, shall be applicable to all products defined therein. 
If test procedures and limits other than those mentioned in the general monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia, or failing this, in the national pharmacopoeia of a Member State, are used, proof shall be supplied that the finished product would, if tested in accordance with those monographs, meet the quality requirements of that pharmacopoeia for the pharmaceutical form concerned. 
1.1. General characteristics of the finished product 
Certain tests of the general characteristics of a product shall always be included among the tests on the finished product. These tests shall, wherever applicable, relate to the control of average masses and maximum deviations, to mechanical, physical or microbiological tests, organoleptic characteristics, physical characteristics such as density, pH, refractive index, etc. For each of these characteristics, standards and tolerance limits shall be specified by the applicant in each particular case. 
The conditions of the tests, where appropriate, the equipment/apparatus employed and the standards shall be described in precise details whenever they are not given in the European Pharmacopoeia or the pharmacopoeia of the Member States; the same shall apply in cases where the methods prescribed by such pharmacopoeias are not applicable. 
Furthermore, solid pharmaceutical forms having to be administered orally shall be subjected to in vitro studies on the liberation and dissolution rate of the active substance or substances; these studies shall also be carried out where administration is by another means if the competent authorities of the Member State concerned consider this necessary. 
1.2. Identification and assay of active substance(s) 
Identification and assay of the active substance(s) shall be carried out either in a representative sample from the production batch or in a number of dosage-units analysed individually. 
Unless there is appropriate justification, the maximum acceptable deviation in the active substance content of the finished product shall not exceed Âą 5 % at the time of manufacture. 
On the basis of the stability tests, the manufacturer must propose and justify maximum acceptable tolerance limits in the active substance content of the finished product up to the end of the proposed shelf-life. 
In certain exceptional cases of particularly complex mixtures, where assay of active substances which are very numerous or present in very low amounts would necessitate an intricate investigation difficult to carry out in respect of each production batch, the assay of one or more active substances in the finished product may be omitted, on the express condition that such assays are made at intermediate stages in the production process. This relaxation may not be extended to the characterization of the substances concerned. This simplified technique shall be supplemented by a method of quantitative evaluation, enabling the competent authority to have the conformity of the medicinal product with its specification verified after it has been placed on the market. 
An in vivo or in vitro biological assay shall be obligatory when physico-chemical methods cannot provide adequate information on the quality of the product. Such an assay shall, whenever possible, include reference materials and statistical analysis allowing calculation of confidence limits. Where these tests cannot be carried out on the finished product, they may be performed at an intermediate stage, as late as possible in the manufacturing process. 
Where the particulars given in section B show that a significant overage of an active substance is employed in the manufacture of the medicinal product, the description of the control tests on the finished product shall include, where appropriate, the chemical and, if necessary, the toxico-pharmacological investigation of the changes that this substance has undergone, and possibly the characterization and/or assay of the degradation products. 
1.3. Identification and assay of excipient components 
In so far as is necessary, the excipient components shall be subject at least to identification tests. 
The test procedure proposed for identifying colouring matters must enable a verification to be made that such matters appear in the list annexed to Directive 78/25/EEC. 
An upper and lower limit test shall be obligatory in respect of preserving agents and an upper limit test for any other excipient component liable to affect adversely physiological functions; an upper and lower limit test shall be obligatory in respect of the excipient if it is liable to affect the bio-availability of an active substance, unless bio-availability is guaranteed by other appropriate tests. 
1.4. Safety tests 
Apart from the toxico-pharmacological tests submitted with the application for marketing authorization, particulars of safety tests, such as sterility, bacterial endotoxin, pyrogenicity and local tolerance in animals shall be included in the analytical particulars wherever such tests must be undertaken as a matter of routine in order to verify the quality of the product. 
G. STABILITY TEST 
The particulars and documents accompanying the application for marketing authorization pursuant to Article 12(3)(f) and (i) shall be submitted in accordance with the following requirements. 
A description shall be given of the investigations by which the shelf life, the recommended storage conditions and the specifications at the end of the shelf life proposed by the applicant have been determined. 
In the case of pre-mixes for medicated feedingstuffs, information shall also be given as necessary on the shelf life of the medicated feedingstuffs manufactured from these pre-mixes in accordance with the recommended instructions for use. 
Where a finished product requires reconstitution prior to administration, details of the proposed shelf life for the reconstituted product are required, supported by relevant stability data. 
In the case of multi-dose vials, stability data shall be presented to justify a shelf life for the vial after it has been punctured for the first time. 
Where a finished product is liable to give rise to degradation products, the applicant must declare these and indicate characterization methods and test procedures. 
The conclusions shall contain the results of analyses, justifying the proposed shelf life under the recommended storage conditions and the specifications of the finished product at the end of the shelf life of the finished product under these recommended storage conditions. 
The maximum acceptable level of degradation products at the end of shelf life shall be indicated. 
A study of the interaction between product and container shall be submitted wherever the risk of such interaction is regarded as possible, especially where injectable preparations or aerosols for internal use are concerned. 
PART 3 
Safety and residues testing 
The particulars and documents which shall accompany the application for marketing authorization pursuant to Articles 12(3)(j) and 13(1) shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements below. 
Member States shall ensure that the tests are carried out in accordance with the provisions relating to good laboratory practice laid down by Council Directive 87/18/EEC of 18 December 1986 on the harmonization of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of the principles of good laboratory practice and the verification of their applications for tests on chemical substances(4) and Council Directive 88/320/EEC of 9 June 1988 on the inspection and verification of good laboratory practice (GLP)(5). 
A. SAFETY TESTING 
Chapter I 
Performance of tests 
1. Introduction 
The safety documentation shall show: 
1. the potential toxicity of the medicinal product and any dangerous or undesirable effects which may occur under the proposed conditions of use in animals; these should be evaluated in relation to the severity of the pathological condition concerned; 
2. the potential harmful effects to man of residues of the veterinary medicinal product or substance in foodstuffs obtained from treated animals and what difficulties these residues may create in the industrial processing of foodstuffs; 
3. the potential risks which may result from the exposure of human beings to the medicinal product, for example during its administration to the animal; 
4. the potential risks for the environment resulting from the use of the medicinal product. 
All results shall be reliable and valid generally. Whenever appropriate, mathematical and statistical procedures shall be used in designing the experimental methods and in evaluating the results. Additionally, clinicians shall be given information about the therapeutic potential of the product and about the hazards connected with its use. 
In some cases it may be necessary to test the metabolites of the parent compound where these represent the residues of concern. 
An excipient used in the pharmaceutical field for the first time shall be treated like an active substance. 
2. Pharmacology 
Pharmacological studies are of fundamental importance in clarifying the mechanisms by which the medicinal product produces its therapeutic effects and therefore pharmacological studies conducted in experimental and target species of animal should be included in Part 4. 
However, pharmacological studies may also assist in the understanding of toxicological phenomena. Moreover, where a medicinal product produces pharmacological effects in the absence of a toxic response, or at doses lower than those required to elicit toxicity, these pharmacological effects shall be taken into account during the evaluation of the safety of the medicinal product. 
Therefore the safety documentation shall always be preceded by details of pharmacological investigations undertaken in laboratory animals and all relevant information observed during clinical studies in the target animal. 
3. Toxicology 
3.1. Single-dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies can be used to predict: 
- the possible effects of acute overdosage in the target species, 
- the possible effects of accidental administration to humans, 
- the doses which may usefully be employed in the repeat dose studies. 
Single dose toxicity studies should reveal the acute toxic effects of the substance and the time course for their onset and remission. 
These studies should normally be carried out in at least two mammalian species. One mammalian species may be replaced, if appropriate, by an animal species for which the medicinal product is intended. At least two different routes of administration should normally be studied. One of these may be the same as, or similar to, that proposed for the target species. If substantial exposure of the user of the medicinal product is anticipated, for example by inhalation or dermal contact, these routes should be studied. 
In order to reduce the number and suffering of the animals involved, new protocols for single dose toxicity testing are continually being developed. Studies carried out in accordance with these new procedures when properly validated will be accepted, as well as studies carried out in accordance with established internationally recognized guidelines. 
3.2. Repeated-dose toxicity 
Repeated-dose toxicity tests are intended to reveal any physiological and/or pathological changes induced by repeated administration of the active substance or combination of active substances under examination, and to determine how these changes are related to dosage. 
In the case of substances or medicinal products intended solely for use in non food-producing animals, a repeated dose toxicity study in one species of experimental animal will normally be sufficient. This study may be replaced by a study conducted in the target animal. The frequency and route of administration, and the duration of the study should be chosen having regard to the proposed conditions of clinical use. The investigator shall give his reasons for the extent and duration of the trials and the dosages chosen. 
In the case of substances or medicinal products intended for use in food producing animals, the study should be conducted in at least two species, one of which should be a non-rodent. The investigator shall give his reasons for the choice of species, having regard to the available knowledge of the metabolism of the product in animals and man. The test substance shall be administered orally. The duration of the test shall be at least 90 days. The investigator shall clearly state and give his reasons for the method and frequency of administration and the length of the trials. 
The maximum dose should normally be selected so as to bring harmful effects to light. The lowest dose level should not produce any evidence of toxicity. 
Evaluation of the toxic effects shall be based on observation of behaviour, growth, haematology and physiological tests, especially those relating to the excretory organs, and also on autopsy reports and accompanying histological data. The choice and range of each group of tests depends on the species of animal used and the state of scientific knowledge at the time. 
In the case of new combinations of known substances which have been investigated in accordance with the provisions of this Directive, the repeated-dose tests may, except where toxicity tests have demonstrated potentiation or novel toxic effects, be suitably modified by the investigator, who shall submit his reasons for such modifications. 
3.3. Tolerance in the target species 
Details should be provided of any signs of intolerance which have been observed during studies conducted in the target species in accordance with the requirements of Part 4, Chapter I, Section B. The studies concerned, the dosages at which the intolerance occurred and the species and breeds concerned should be identified. Details of any unexpected physiological changes should also be provided. 
3.4. Reproductive toxicity including teratogenicity 
3.4.1. Study of the effects on reproduction 
The purpose of this study is to identify possible impairment of male or female reproductive function or harmful effects on progeny resulting from the administration of the medicinal products or substance under investigation. 
In the case of substances or medicinal products intended for use in food-producing animals, the study of the effects on reproduction shall be carried out in the form of a two-generation study on at least one species, usually a rodent. The substance or product under investigation shall be administered to males and females at an appropriate time prior to mating. Administration should continue until the weaning of the F2 generation. At least three dose levels shall be used. The maximum dose should be selected so as to bring harmful effects to light. The lowest dose level should not produce any evidence of toxicity. 
Evaluation of the effects on reproduction shall be based upon fertility, pregnancy and maternal behaviour; the suckling, growth and development of the F1 offspring from conception to maturity; the development of the F2 offspring to weaning. 
3.4.2. Study of embryotoxic/fetotoxic effects including teratogenecity 
In the case of substances or medicinal products intended for use in food producing animals, studies of embryotoxic/fetotoxic effects, including teratogenicity, shall be carried out. These studies shall be carried out in at least two mammalian species, usually a rodent and the rabbit. The details of the test (number of animals, doses, time at which administered and criteria for the evaluation of results) shall depend on the state of scientific knowledge at the time the application is lodged and the level of statistical significance which the results should attain. The rodent study may be combined with the study of effects on reproductive function. 
In the case of substances or medicinal products which are not intended for use in food producing animals, a study of embryotoxic/fetotoxic effects, including teratogenicity, shall be required in at least one species, which may be the target species, if the product is intended for use in animals which might be used for breeding. 
3.5. Mutagenicity 
Mutagenicity tests are intended to assess the potential of substances to cause transmissible changes in the genetic material of cells. 
Any new substance intended for use in veterinary medicinal products must be assessed for mutagenic properties. 
The number and types of tests and the criteria for the evaluation of the results shall depend on the state of scientific knowledge when the application is submitted. 
3.6. Carcinogenicity 
Long term animal carcinogenicity studies will usually be required for substances to which human beings will be exposed 
- which have a close chemical analogy with known carcinogens, 
- which during mutagenicity testing produced results indicating a possibility of carcinogenic effects, 
- which have given rise to suspect signs during toxicity testing. 
The state of scientific knowledge at the time the application is submitted shall be taken into account when designing carcinogenicity studies and evaluating their results. 
3.7. Exceptions 
Where a medicinal product is intended for topical use, systemic absorption shall be investigated in the target species of animal. If it is proved that systemic absorption is negligible, the repeated dose toxicity tests, the tests for reproductive toxicity and the carcinogenicity tests may be omitted, unless: 
- under the conditions of use laid down, oral ingestion of the medicinal product by the animal is to be expected, or 
- the medicinal particular may enter foodstuffs obtained from the treated animal (intramammary preparations). 
4. Other requirements 
4.1. Immunotoxicity 
Where the effects observed during repeated dose studies in animals include specific changes in lymphoid organ weights and/or histology and changes in the cellularity of lymphoid tissues, bone marrow or peripheral leukocytes, the investigator shall consider the need for additional studies of the effects of the product on the immune system. 
The state of scientific knowledge at the time the application is submitted shall be taken into account when designing such studies and evaluating their results. 
4.2. Microbiological properties of residues 
4.2.1. Potential effects on the human gut flora 
The microbiological risk presented by residues of anti-microbial compounds for the human intestinal flora shall be investigated in accordance with the state of scientific knowledge at the time the application is submitted. 
4.2.2. Potential effects on the microorganisms used for industrial food processing 
In certain cases, it may be necessary to carry out tests to determine whether residues cause difficulties affecting technological processes in industrial foodstuff processing. 
4.3. Observations in humans 
Information shall be provided showing whether the constituents of the veterinary medicinal product are used as medicinal products in human therapy; if this is so, a report should be made on all the effects observed (including adverse reactions) in humans and on their cause, to the extent that they may be important for the assessment of the veterinary medicinal product, where appropriate in the light of trial results of bibliographical documents; where constituents of the veterinary medicinal products are themselves not used or are no longer used as medicinal products in human therapy, the reasons should be stated. 
5. Ecotoxicity 
5.1. The purpose of the study of the ecotoxicity of a veterinary medicinal product is to assess the potential harmful effects which the use of the product may cause to the environment and to identify any precautionary measures which may be necessary to reduce such risks. 
5.2. An assessment of ecotoxicity shall be compulsory for any application for marketing authorization for a veterinary medicinal product other than applications submitted in accordance with Articles 12(3)(j) and 13(1). 
5.3. This assessment shall normally be conducted in two phases. 
In the first phase, the investigator shall assess the potential extent of exposure to the environment of the product, its active substances or relevant metabolites, taking into account: 
- the target species, and the proposed pattern of use (for example, mass-medication or individual animal medication), 
- the method of administration, in particular the likely extent to which the product will enter directly into environmental systems, 
- the possible excretion of the product, its active substances or relevant metabolites into the environment by treated animals; persistence in such excretia, 
- the disposal of unused or waste product. 
5.4. In a second phase, having regard to the extent of exposure of the product to the environment, and the available information about the physical/chemical, pharmacological and/or toxicological properties of the compound which has been obtained during the conduct of the other tests and trials required by this Directive, the investigator shall then consider whether further specific investigation of the effects of the product on particular eco-systems is necessary. 
5.5. As appropriate, further investigation may be required of: 
- fate and behaviour in soil, 
- fate and behaviour in water and air, 
- effects on aquatic organisms, 
- effects on other non-target organisms. 
These further investigations shall be carried out in accordance with the test protocols laid down in Annex V of Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances(6), or where an end point is not adequately covered by these protocols, in accordance with other internationally recognized protocols on the veterinary medicinal product and/or the active substance(s) and/or the excreted metabolites as appropriate. The number and types of tests and the criteria for their evaluation shall depend upon the state of scientific knowledge at the time the application is submitted.

B. RESIDUE TESTING 
Chapter I 
Performance of tests 
1. Introduction 
For the purposes of this Directive, %quot%residues%quot% means all active substances or metabolites thereof which remain in meat or other foodstuffs produced from the animal to which the medicinal product in question has been administered. 
The purpose of studying residues is to determine whether, and if so under what conditions and to what extent, residues persist in foodstuffs produced from treated animals and to ascertain the withdrawal periods to be adhered to in order to obviate any hazard to human health and/or difficulties in the industrial processing of foodstuffs. 
Assessment of the hazard due to residues entails establishing whether residues are present in the animals treated under recommended conditions of use and investigating the effects of those residues. 
In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in food-producing animals, the residue documentation shall show: 
1. to what extent, and how long, do residues of the veterinary medicinal product or its metabolites persist in the tissues of the treated animal or foodstuffs obtained therefrom; 
2. that in order to prevent any risk to the health of the consumer of foodstuffs of treated animals, or difficulties in the industrial processing of foodstuffs, it is possible to establish realistic withdrawal periods which can be observed under practical farming conditions; 
3. that practical analytical methods suitable for routine use are available to verify compliance with the withdrawal period. 
2. Metabolism and residue kinetics 
2.1. Pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, biotransformation, excretion) 
The purpose of pharmacokinetic studies with respect to residues of veterinary medicinal products is to evaluate the absorption, distribution, biotransformation and excretion of the product in the target species. 
The final product, or a formulation which is bioequivalent, shall be administered to the target species at the maximum recommended dose. 
Having regard to the method of administration, the extent of absorption of the medicinal product shall be fully described. If it is demonstrated that systemic absorption of products for topical application is negligible, further residue studies will not be required. 
The distribution of the medicinal product in the target animal shall be described; the possibility of plasma protein binding, or passage into milk or eggs and of the accumulation of lipophilic compounds shall be considered. 
The pathways for the excretion of the product from the target animal shall be described. The major metabolites shall be identified and characterised. 
2.2. Depletion of residues 
The purposes of these studies, which measure the rate at which residues deplete in the target animal after the last administration of the medicinal product, is to permit the determination of withdrawal periods. 
At varying times after the test animal has received the final dose of the medicinal product, the quantities of residues present shall be determined by appropriate physical, chemical or biological methods; the technical procedures and the reliability and sensitivity of the methods employed shall be specified. 
3. Routine analytical method for the detection of residues 
Analytical procedures shall be proposed which can be carried out in the course of a routine examination and which have a level of sensitivity such as to enable violations of legally permitted maximum residue limits to be detected with certainty. 
The analytical method proposed shall be described in detail. It shall be validated and shall be sufficiently rugged for use under normal conditions of routine monitoring for residues. 
The following characteristics shall be described: 
- specificity, 
- accuracy, including sensitivity, 
- precision,

PART 4 
Pre-clinical and clinical testing 
The particulars and documents which shall accompany applications for marketing authorizations pursuant to Articles 12(3)(j) and 13(1) shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions of this Part. 
Chapter I 
Pre-clinical requirements 
Pre-clinical studies are required to establish the pharmacological activity and the tolerance of the product. 
A. PHARMACOLOGY 
A.1. Pharmacodynamics 
The study of pharmacodynamics shall follow two distinct lines of approach: 
First, the mechanism of action and the pharmacological effects on which the recommended application in practice is based shall be adequately described. The results shall be expressed in quantitative terms (using, for example, dose-effect curves, time-effect curves, etc.) and, wherever possible, in comparison with a substance the activity of which is well known. Where a higher efficacy is being claimed for an active substance, the difference shall be demonstrated and shown to be statistically significant. 
Secondly, the investigator shall give an overall pharmacological assessment of the active substance, with special reference to the possibility of side-effects. In general, the main functions shall be investigated. 
The investigator shall identify the effect of the route of administration, formulation, etc, on the pharmacological activity of the active substance. 
The investigations shall be intensified where the recommended dose approaches that liable to produce adverse reactions. 
The experimental techniques, unless they are standard procedures, shall be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced, and the investigator shall establish their validity. The experimental results shall be set out clearly and, for certain types of tests, their statistical significance quoted. 
Unless good reasons are given to the contrary, any quantitative modification of responses resulting from repeated administration of the substance shall also be investigated. 
Medicinal combinations may be prompted either on pharmacological grounds or by clinical indications. In the first case, the pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic studies shall demonstrate those interactions which might make the combination itself of value in clinical use. In the second case, where scientific justification for the medicinal combination is sought through clinical experimentation, the investigation shall determine whether the effects expected from the combination can be demonstrated in animals and, at least, the importance of any adverse reactions shall be checked. If a combination includes a novel active substance, the latter shall have been previously studied in depth. 
A.2. Pharmacokinetics 
Basic pharmacokinetic information concerning a new active substance is generally useful in the clinical context. 
Pharmacokinetic objectives can be divided into two main areas: 
(i) descriptive pharmacokinetics leading to the evaluation of basic parameters such as body clearance, volume(s) of distribution, mean residence time, etc; 
(ii) use of these parameters to investigate the relationships between dosage regimen, plasma and tissue concentration and pharmacologic, therapeutic or toxic effects. 
In target species, pharmacokinetic studies are, as a rule, necessary in order to employ drugs with the greatest possible efficacy and safety. Such studies are especially useful to assist the clinician in establishing dosage regimens (route and site of administration, dose, dosing interval, number of administrations, etc.) and to adopt dosage regimens according to certain population variables (e.g. age, disease). Such studies can be more efficient in number of animals and generally provide more information than classical dose titration studies. 
In the case of new combinations of known substances which have been investigated in accordance with the provisions of this Directive, pharmacokinetic studies of the fixed combination are not required if it can be justified that the administration of the active substances as a fixed combination does not change their pharmacokinetic properties. 
A.2.1. Bioavailability/bioequivalence 
Appropriate bioavailability studies shall be undertaken to establish bioequivalence: 
- when comparing a reformulated medicinal product with the existing one, 
- when comparing a new method or route of administration with an established one, 
- in all cases referred to in Article 13(1). 
B. TOLERANCE IN THE TARGET SPECIES OF ANIMAL 
The purpose of this study, which shall be carried out with all animal species for which the medicinal product is intended, is to carry out in all such animal species local and general tolerance trials designed to establish a tolerated dosage wide enough to allow an adequate safety margin and the clinical symptoms of intolerance using the recommended route or routes, in so far as this may be achieved by increasing the therapeutic dose and/or the duration of treatment. The report on the trials shall contain as many details as possible of the expected pharmacological effects and the adverse reactions; the latter shall be assessed with due regard to the fact that the animals used may be of very high value. 
The medicinal product shall be administered at least via the recommended route of administration. 
C. RESISTANCE 
Data on the emergence of resistant organisms are necessary in the case of medicinal products used for the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases or parasitic infestations in animals. 
Chapter II 
Clinical requirements 
1. General principles 
The purposes of clinical trials are to demonstrate or substantiate the effect of the veterinary medicinal product after administration of the recommended dosage, to specify its indications and contra-indications according to species, age, breed and sex, its directions for use, any adverse reactions which it may have and its safety and tolerance under normal conditions of use. 
Unless justified, clinical trials shall be carried out with control animals (controlled clinical trials). The effect obtained should be compared with a placebo or with absence of treatment and/or with the effect of an authorized medicinal product known to be of therapeutic value. All the results obtained, whether positive or negative, shall be reported. 
The methods used to make the diagnosis shall be specified. The results shall be set out by making use of quantitative or conventional clinical criteria. Adequate statistical methods shall be used and justified. 
In the case of a veterinary medicinal product intended primarily for use as a performance enhancer, particular attention shall be given to: 
- the yield of animal produce, 
- the quality of animal produce (organoleptic, nutritional, hygienic and technological qualities), 
- nutritional efficiency and growth of animal, 
- the general status of health of the animal. 
Experimental data shall be confirmed by data obtained under practical field conditions. 
Where, in respect of particular therapeutic indications, the applicant can show that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on therapeutic effect because: 
(a) the indications for which the medicinal product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence; 
(b) in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided; 
the marketing authorization may only be granted subject to the following conditions: 
(a) the medicinal product in question is to be supplied on veterinary prescription only and may, in certain cases, be administered only under strict veterinary supervision; 
(b) the package insert and any other information must draw the attention of the veterinary practitioner to the fact that, in certain specified respects, the particulars available concerning the medicinal product in question are as yet incomplete. 
2. Performance of trials 
All veterinary clinical trials shall be conducted in accordance with a fully considered detailed trial protocol which shall be recorded in writing prior to commencement of the trial. The welfare of the trial animals shall be subject to veterinary supervision and shall be taken fully into consideration during the elaboration of any trial protocol and throughout the conduct of the trial. 
Pre-established systematic written procedures for the organization, conduct, data collection, documentation and verification of clinical trials shall be required. 
Before the commencement of any trial, the informed consent of the owner of the animals to be used in the trial shall be obtained and documented. In particular, the animal owner shall be informed in writing of the consequences of participation in the trial for the subsequent disposal of treated animals or for the taking of foodstuffs from treated animals. A copy of this notification, countersigned and dated by the animal owner, shall be included in the trial documentation. 
Unless the trial is conducted with a blind design, the provisions of Articles 58, 59 and 60 concerning the labelling of veterinary medicinal products shall apply by analogy to the labelling of formulations intended for use in veterinary clinical trials. In all cases, the words %quot%for veterinary clinical trial use only%quot% shall appear prominently and indelibly upon the labelling.

PART 7 
Safety testing 
A. INTRODUCTION 
1. The safety tests shall show the potential risks from the immunological veterinary medicinal product which may occur under the proposed conditions of use in animals: these shall be evaluated in relation to the potential benefits of the product. 
Where immunological veterinary medicinal products consist of live organisms, especially those which could be shed by vaccinated animals, the potential risk to unvaccinated animals of the same or of any other potentially exposed species shall be evaluated. 
2. The particulars and documents which shall accompany the application for marketing authorization pursuant to Article 12(3)(j) and 13(1) shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements of section B. 
3. Member States shall ensure that the laboratory tests are carried out in conformity with the principles of good laboratory practice laid down in Council Directives 87/18/EEC and 88/320/EEC. 
B. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 
1. The safety tests shall be carried out in the target species. 
2. The dose to be used shall be that quantity of the product to be recommended for use and containing the maximum titre or potency for which the application is submitted. 
3. The sample used for safety testing shall be taken from a batch or batches produced according to the manufacturing process described in the application for marketing authorization. 
C. LABORATORY TESTS 
1. Safety of the administration of one dose 
The immunological veterinary medicinal product shall be administered at the recommended dose and by each recommended route of administration to animals of each species and category in which it is intended for use, including animals of the minimum age of administration. The animals shall be observed and examined for signs of systemic and local reactions. Where appropriate, these studies shall include detailed post-mortem macroscopic and microscopic examinations of the injection site. Other objective criteria shall be recorded, such as rectal temperature and performance measurements. 
The animals shall be observed and examined until reactions may no longer be expected, but in all cases, the observation and examination period shall be at least 14 days after administration. 
2. Safety of one administration of an overdose 
An overdose of the immunological veterinary medicinal product shall be administered by each recommended route of administration to animals of the most sensitive categories of the target species. The animals shall be observed and examined for signs of systemic and local reactions. Other objective criteria shall be recorded, such as rectal temperature and performance measurements. 
The animals shall be observed and examined for at least 14 days after administration. 
3. Safety of the repeated administration of one dose 
Repeated administration of one dose may be required to reveal any adverse effects induced by such administration. These tests shall be carried out on the most sensitive categories of the target species, using the recommended route of administration. 
The animals shall be observed and examined for at least 14 days after the last administration for signs of systemic and local reactions. Other objective criteria shall be recorded, such as rectal temperature and performance measurements. 
4. Examination of reproductive performance 
Examination of reproductive performance shall be considered when data suggest that the starting material from which the product is derived may be a potential risk factor. Reproductive performance of males and non-pregnant and pregnant females shall be investigated with the recommended dose and by each of the recommended routes of administration. In addition, harmful effects on the progeny, as well as teratogenic and abortifacient effects, shall be investigated. 
These studies may form part of the safety studies described in paragraph 1. 
5. Examination of immunological functions 
Where the immunological veterinary medicinal product might adversely affect the immune response of the vaccinated animal or of its progeny, suitable tests on the immunological functions shall be carried out. 
6. Special requirements for live vaccines: 
6.1. Spread of the vaccine strain 
Spread of the vaccine strain from vaccinated to unvaccinated target animals shall be investigated, using the recommended route of administration most likely to result in the spread. Moreover, it may be necessary to investigate the spread to non target species which could be highly susceptible to a live vaccine strain. 
6.2. Dissemination in the vaccinated animal 
Faeces, urine, milk, eggs, oral, nasal and other secretions shall be tested for the presence of the organism. Moreover, studies may be required of the dissemination of the vaccine strain in the body, with particular attention being paid to the predilection sites for replication of the organism. In the case of live vaccines for well established zoonotic diseases for food producing animals, these studies must be undertaken. 
6.3. Reversion to virulence of attenuated vaccines 
Reversion to virulence shall be investigated with material from the passage level which is least attenuated between the master seed and the final product. The initial vaccination shall be carried out using the recommended route of administration most likely to lead to reversion to virulence. At least five serial passages through animals of the target species shall be undertaken. Where this is not technically possible due to failure of the organism to replicate adequately, as many passages as possible shall be carried out in the target species. If necessary, in vitro propagation of the organism may be carried out between passages in vivo. The passages shall be undertaken by the route of administration most likely to lead to reversion to virulence. 
6.4. Biological properties of the vaccine strain 
Other tests may be necessary to determine as precisely as possible the intrinsic biological properties of the vaccine strain (e.g. neurotropism). 
6.5. Recombination or genomic reassortment of strains 
The probability of recombination or genomic reassortment with field or other strains shall be discussed. 
7. Study of residues 
For immunological veterinary medicinal products, it will normally not be necessary to undertake a study of residues. However, where adjuvants and/or preservatives are used in the manufacture of immunological veterinary medicinal products, consideration shall be given to the possibility of any residue remaining in the foodstuffs. If necessary, the effects of such residues shall be investigated. Moreover, in the case of live vaccines for zoonotic diseases, the determination of residues at the injection site may be required in addition to the studies described in paragraph 6.2. 
A proposal for a withdrawal period shall be made and its adequacy shall be discussed in relation to any residue studies which have been undertaken. 
8. Interactions 
Any known interactions with other products shall be indicated. 
D. FIELD STUDIES 
Unless justified, results from laboratory studies shall be supplemented with supportive data from field studies. 
E. ECOTOXICITY 
The purpose of the study of the ecotoxicity of an immunological veterinary medicinal product is to assess the potential harmful effects which the use of the product may cause to the environment and to identify any precautionary measures which may be necessary to reduce such risks. 
An assessment of ecotoxicity shall be compulsory for any application for marketing authorization for an immunological veterinary medicinal product other than applications submitted in accordance with Article 12(3)(j) and 13(1). 
This assessment shall normally be conducted in two phases. 
The first phase of the assessment shall always be carried out: the investigator shall assess the potential extent of exposure of the environment to the product, its active substances, or relevant metabolites, taking into account: 
- the target species and the proposed pattern of use (e.g. mass medication or individual animal medication), 
- the method of administration, in particular the likely extent to which the product will enter directly into environmental system, 
- the possible excretion of the product, its active substances or relevant metabolites into the environment by treated animals, persistence in such excretia, 
- the disposal of unused or waste product. 
Where the conclusions of the first phase indicate potential exposure of the environment to the product, the applicant shall proceed to the second phase and evaluate the potential ecotoxicity of the product. For this purpose, he shall consider the extent and duration of exposure of the environment to the product, and the information about the physical/chemical, pharmacological and/or toxicological properties of the compound obtained during the conduct of the other tests and trials required by this Directive. Where necessary, further investigations on the impact of the product (soil, water, air, aquatic systems, non-target organisms) shall be carried out. 
These further investigations shall be carried out in accordance with the test protocols laid down in Annex V to Council Directive 67/548/EEC or where an end point is not adequately covered by these protocols, in accordance with other internationally recognized protocols on the immunological veterinary medicinal product and/or the active substances and/or the excreted metabolites as appropriate. The number and types of tests and the criteria for their evaluation shall depend upon the state of scientific knowledge at the time the application is submitted.
