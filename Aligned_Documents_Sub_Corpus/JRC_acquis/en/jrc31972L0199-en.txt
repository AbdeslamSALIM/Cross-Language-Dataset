ANNEX I 
1 . DETERMINATION OF STARCH 
POLARIMETRIC METHOD 
1 . PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
THIS METHOD MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE LEVELS OF STARCH AND OF HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT STARCH DEGRADATION PRODUCTS IN FEEDINGSTUFFS , WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE FEEDINGSTUFFS WHICH CONTAIN BEET CHIPS , BEET PULP , DRIED BEET TOPS OR LEAVES , POTATO PULP , DEHYDRATED YEAST , PRODUCTS RICE IN INULIN ( E . G . CHIPS AND MEAL OF JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES ) OR GREAVES . 
2 . PRINCIPLE 
THE METHOD COMPRISES TWO DETERMINATIONS . IN THE FIRST , THE SAMPLE IS TREATED WHEN HOT WITH DILUTE HYDROCHLORIC ACID . AFTER CLARIFICATION AND FILTRATION THE OPTICAL ROTATION OF THE SOLUTION IS MEASURED BY POLARIMETRY . 
IN THE SECOND , THE SAMPLE IS EXTRACTED WITH 40 % ETHANOL . AFTER ACIDIFYING THE FILTRATE WITH HYDROCHLORIC ACID , CLARIFYING AND FILTERING , THE OPTICAL ROTATION IS MEASURED AS IN THE FIRST DETERMINATION . 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO MEASUREMENTS , MULTIPLIED BY A KNOWN FACTOR , GIVES THE STARCH CONTENT OF THE SAMPLE . 
3 . REAGENTS 
3.1 25 % ( W/W ) HYDROCHLORIC ACID , D : 1.126 . 
3.2 1.128 % ( W/V ) HYDROCHLORIC ACID . 
THE CONCENTRATION MUST BE CHECKED BY TITRATION USING A SODIUM HYDROXIDE SOLUTION 0.1 N IN THE PRESENCE OF 0.1 % ( W/V ) METHYL RED IN 94 % ( V/V ) ETHANOL . 10 ML = 30.94 ML OF NAOH 0.1 N . 
3.3 CARREZ SOLUTION I : DISSOLVE 21.9 G OF ZINC ACETATE ZN ( CH3COO ) 2.2H2O AND 3 G OF GLACIAL ACETIC ACID IN WATER . MAKE UP TO 100 ML WITH WATER .

WEIGH 2.5 G OF THE CRUSHED SAMPLE TO THE NEAREST MG AND PLACE IN A 100 ML GRADUATED FLASK . ADD 25 ML OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID ( 3.2 ) , SHAKE TO OBTAIN EVEN DISTRIBUTION OF THE TEST SAMPLE AND ADD A FURTHER 25 ML OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID ( 3.2 ) . IMMERSE THE FLASK IN A BOILING WATER BATH SHAKING VIGOROUSLY AND STEADILY FOR THE FIRST THREE MINUTES TO PREVENT THE FORMATION OF AGGLOMERATES . THE QUANTITY OF WATER IN THE WATER BATH MUST BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE BATH TO REMAIN AT BOILING POINT WHEN THE FLASK IS INTRODUCED INTO IT . THE FLASK MUST NOT BE TAKEN OUT OF THE BATH WHILST BEING SHAKEN . AFTER EXACTLY 15 MINUTES , REMOVE FROM THE BATH , ADD 30 ML OF COLD WATER AND COOL IMMEDIATELY TO 20* C . 
ADD 5 ML OF CARREZ SOLUTION I ( 3.3 ) AND SHAKE FOR ONE MINUTE . THEN ADD 5 ML OF CARREZ SOLUTION II ( 3.4 ) AND SHAKE AGAIN FOR ONE MINUTE . MAKE UP TO VOLUME WITH WATER , HOMOGENIZE AND FILTER . IF THE FILTRATE IS NOT PERFECTLY CLEAR ( WHICH IS RARE ) , REPEAT THE DETERMINATION USING A LARGER QUANTITY OF CARREZ SOLUTIONS I AND II , FOR EXAMPLE 10 ML . 
MEASURE THE OPTICAL ROTATION OF THE SOLUTION IN A 200 MM TUBE WITH THE POLARIMETER OR SACCHARIMETER . 
5.3 DETERMINATION OF THE OPTICAL ROTATION ( P' OR S' ) OF SUBSTANCES SOLUBLE IN 40 % ETHANOL 
WEIGH 5 G OF THE SAMPLE TO THE NEAREST MG , PLACE IN A 100 ML GRADUATED FLASK AND ADD ABOUT 80 ML OF ETHANOL ( 3.5 ) ( SEE OBSERVATION 7.2 ) .

5 . PROCEDURE 
5.1 TEST SAMPLE 
THE AMOUNT OF TEST SAMPLE USED DEPENDS ON THE PRESUMED GOSSYPOL CONTENT OF THE SAMPLE . IT IS PREFERABLE TO WORK WITH A SMALL TEST SAMPLE AND A RELATIVELY LARGE ALIQUOT PART OF THE FILTRATE , SO AS TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT GOSSYPOL FOR PRECISE PHOTOMETRIC MEASUREMENT TO BE POSSIBLE . FOR THE DETERMINATION OF FREE GOSSYPOL IN COTTONSEED , COTTONSEED MEAL AND COTTONSEED CAKE , THE TEST SAMPLE SHOULD NOT EXCEED 1 G ; FOR COMPOUND FEEDINGSTUFFS , IT MAY BE AS MUCH AS 5 G . A 10 ML ALIQUOT PART OF FILTRATE IS SUITABLE IN MOST CASES ; IT SHOULD CONTAIN 50 TO 100 UG OF GOSSYPOL . FOR THE DETERMINATION OF TOTAL GOSSYPOL , THE TEST SAMPLE SHOULD BE BETWEEN 0.5 AND 5 G , THAT A 2 ML ALIQUOT PART OF FILTRATE WILL CONTAIN 40 TO 200 UG OF GOSSYPOL . 
THE ANALYSIS SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT A ROOM TEMPERATURE OF ABOUT 20* C .

7 . DETERMINATION METHOD 
7.1 PREPARATION OF THE STANDARD SERIES AND OF THE EXTRACT 
DILUTE THE STANDARD SOLUTION ( 5 ) AND THE EXTRACT ( 6 ) WITH THE PHOSPHATE BUFFER SOLUTION , PH 4.5 ( 4.2 ) , TO OBTAIN A SERIES OF CONCENTRATIONS . FOR EACH DETERMINATION , A CALIBRATION CURVE IS DRAWN FROM THE RESPECTIVE CONCENTRATION , PERMITTING THE INTERPOLATION OF AT LEAST TWO VALUES RELATING TO THE EXTRACT . THE DILUTIONS SHOULD BE CHOSEN ACCORDING TO THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE STRAIN IS GROWN , WHICH MAY VARY FROM ONE LABORATORY TO ANOTHER . THE PROCEDURE IS GENERALLY THE FOLLOWING : 
7.1.1 CHLORTETRACYCLINE 
DILUTE THE STANDARD SOLUTION ( 5 ) WITH THE PHOSPHATE BUFFER SOLUTION ( 4.2 ) TO OBTAIN A STANDARD WORKING SOLUTION WITH A CONCENTRATION CORRESPONDING TO 0.2 UG PER ML OF CTC-HCL . THEN , USING THE PHOSPHATE BUFFER SOLUTION ( 4.2 ) , PREPARE IN TEST TUBES , AS INDICATED BELOW , 6 DILUTIONS , EACH DILUTION IN DUPLICATE . 
DILUTE THE EXTRACT ( 6.1 ) WITH THE PHOSPHATE BUFFER SOLUTION ( 4.2 ) TO OBTAIN A PRESUMED CTC-HCL CONCENTRATION OF 0.12 UG PER ML . PLACE 1 ML OF THIS SOLUTION IN EACH OF 2 TUBES , AND 0.75 ML ( = 0.09 UG ) IN EACH OF 2 OTHER TUBES . MAKE THE VOLUME OF THE LATTER TWO TUBES UP TO 1 ML WITH THE PHOSPHATE BUFFER SOLUTION ( 4.2 ) . 
7.1.2 OXYTETRACYCLINE AND TETRACYCLINE 
DILUTE THE STANDARD SOLUTION ( 5 ) WITH THE PHOSPHATE BUFFER SOLUTION ( 4.2 ) TO OBTAIN A STANDARD WORKING SOLUTION WITH A CONCENTRATION CORRESPONDING TO 0.6 UG PER ML OF OTC-HCL OR OF TC-HCL . THEN , USING THE PHOSPHATE BUFFER SOLUTION ( 4.2 ) , PREPARE IN TEST TUBES , AS INDICATED BELOW , 7 DILUTIONS , EACH DILUTION IN DUPLICATE . 
DILUTE THE EXTRACT ( 6.2 ) WITH THE PHOSPHATE BUFFER SOLUTION ( 4.2 ) TO OBTAIN A PRESUMED OTC-HCL OR TC-HCL CONCENTRATION OF 0.48 UG PER ML . PLACE 1 ML OF THIS SOLUTION IN EACH OF 2 TUBES , AND 0.5 ML ( = 0.24 UG ) IN EACH OF 2 OTHER TUBES . MAKES THE VOLUME OF THE LATTER TWO TUBES UP TO 1 ML WITH THE PHOSPHATE BUFFER SOLUTION ( 4.2 ) . 
7.2 INOCULATION OF THE CULTURE MEDIUM 
INOCULATE THE BASIC MEDIUM FOR THE DETERMINATION ( 4.1 ) WITH THE INOCULUM ( 3.2 ) TO OBTAIN WITH THE PHOTOMETER AT 590 NM 85 % LIGHT TRANSMISSION IN A 5 CM CELL OR 92 % TRANSMISSION IN A 2 CM CELL , THE APPARATUS BEING SET AT 100 % TRANSMISSION ON THE NON-INOCULATED BASIC MEDIUM ( 4.1 ) . 
7.3 SEEDING 
PLACE 9 ML OF THE INOCULATED CULTURE MEDIUM ( 7.2 ) IN EACH TUBE ( 7.1.1 OR 7.1.2 ) . THE TUBES MUST BE FILLED UNDER CLEAN BUT NOT NECESSARILY STERILE CONDITIONS . 
7.4 INCUBATION 
INCUBATION MUST BE CARRIED OUT IN A WATER BATH WHOSE TEMPERATURE IS KEPT UNIFORM AT 37* C MORE OR LESS 0.1* C BY STIRRING . THE INCUBATION PERIOD CHOSEN ( GENERALLY 2 HOURS 30 MINUTES TO 3 HOURS ) MUST BE SUCH THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO TRACE TRANSMISSION CURVES WITH GRADIENTS SUITABLE FOR ACCURATE MEASUREMENT . THEN BLOCK FURTHER GROWTH BY RAPIDLY INJECTING 1 ML OF FORMALDEHYDE SOLUTION ( 4.6 ) INTO EACH TUBE . 
7.5 MEASUREMENT OF GROWTH 
MEASURE THE TRANSMISSIONS WITH THE PHOTOMETER AT 590 NM , SETTING THE APPARATUS AT 100 % TRANSMISSION ON THE CLEAREST STANDARD SOLUTION ( CORRESPONDING TO THE HIGHEST ANTIBIOTIC CONTENT ) . SINCE THE DIFFERENT TUBES WILL SHOW SLIGHT DIFFERENCES OF TURBIDITY , AT LEAST 2 CM , AND PREFERABLY 5 CM , CELLS SHOULD BE USED . 
8 . CALCULATION OF RESULTS 
TRACE THE CALIBRATION CURVE ON MILLIMETRE GRAPH PAPER BY PLOTTING THE PHOTOMETRIC TRANSMISSIONS AGAINST THE ANTIBIOTIC CONCENTRATIONS . INTERPOLATE ON THE CURVE THE TRANSMISSION VALUES OF THE EXTRACT . CALCULATE THE ANTIBIOTIC CONTENT OF THE SAMPLE . 
9 . REPEATABILITY
