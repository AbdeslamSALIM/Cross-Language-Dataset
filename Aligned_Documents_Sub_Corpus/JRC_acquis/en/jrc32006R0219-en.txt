Commission Regulation (EC) No 219/2006 
of 8 February 2006 
opening and providing for the administration of the tariff quota for bananas falling under CN code 08030019 originating in ACP countries for the period 1 March to 31 December 2006 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 of 29 November 2005 on the tariff rates for bananas [1], and in particular Article 2 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 provides that each year from 1 January, with effect from 1 January 2006, an autonomous tariff quota of 775000 tonnes net weight subject to a zero-duty rate is to be opened for imports of bananas under CN code 08030019 originating in ACP countries. 
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2015/2005 of 9 December 2005 on imports during January and February 2006 of bananas originating in ACP countries under the tariff quota opened by Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 on the tariff rates for bananas [2], adopts the interim measures needed to ensure Community market supplies and continuity of trade with the ACP countries and to avoid disruptions of trade flows during those two months. To that end, an overall amount of 160000 tonnes has been made available for the purpose of issuing import licences under that tariff quota. 
(3) The tariff quota provided for by Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 for 2006 should therefore be opened and the provisions for its administration laid down for the period 1 March to 31 December 2006. 
(4) As is the case for non-preferential imports, a method of administering the tariff quota should be adopted so as to favour international trade and smoother trade flows. The most appropriate method for this purpose would be that using the quota by chronological order of acceptance of the declarations of release for free circulation (the %quot%first come, first served%quot% method). Nevertheless, in order to ensure continuity of trade with ACP countries and, therefore, satisfactory supplies for the Community market while avoiding disturbances in trade flows, part of the tariff quota should for the time being be reserved for operators who supplied the Community with ACP bananas under the import arrangements previously in force. 
(5) Provision should therefore be made for a total quantity of 146850 tonnes of the tariff quota to be reserved for the operators who actually imported bananas originating in ACP countries into the Community during 2005. That proportion of the tariff quota should be administered by means of import licences issued to each operator in proportion to the quantities released for free circulation during 2005. 
(6) In view of the quantities available, a ceiling should be set for the licence application which each operator may lodge for the period 1 March to 31 December 2006. 
(7) Access to the rest of the tariff quota should be open to all operators established in the Community on a %quot%first come, first served%quot% basis in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code [3]. 
(8) As a result of the entry into force of the common customs tariff rate for bananas established by Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005, the import tariff quota arrangements established by Title IV of Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas [4] ceased applying on 31 December 2005 as provided for in Article 16(1) of that Regulation. The rules for administering tariff quotas provided for in Title IV of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 [5] are therefore null and void. 
(9) For reasons of clarity and legal certainty, Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 should therefore be repealed. Nevertheless, some of its provisions should remain in force, particularly as regards the communication of information by the Member States which has been found useful for the purposes of administering the imports under this Regulation. 
(10) This Regulation should enter into force immediately in order to enable licence applications to be lodged in time. 
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
