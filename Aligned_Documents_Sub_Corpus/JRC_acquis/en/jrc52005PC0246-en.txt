( presented by the Commission) {SEC(2004) 1154} 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. Introduction 
On 22 September 2004, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/88/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time.[1] This proposal was forwarded to the European Parliament and the Council on 22 September 2004. 
On 11 May 2005, the Economic and Social Committee gave its opinion on the Commission proposal.[2] The Committee of the Regions gave its opinion on 14 April 2005.[3] 
The European Parliament gave its opinion at first reading on 11 May 2005.[4] 
2. AMENDMENTS 
Amendments proposed by the European Parliament 
The Commission is prepared to accept all the amendments set out below, which, it thinks, improve the proposal and maintain its aims and political viability, taking account of the positions already expressed by the Member States to the Council: 
- amendment No 1 (citing the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council): see recital No 4; 
- amendment No 2 (rewording recital No 4): see recital No 4; 
- amendment No 3 (reference to increasing the rate of employment amongst women): see recital No 5; 
- amendment No 4 (addition of a reference to compatibility between work and family): see recital No 7; 
- amendment No 8 (citing Article 31(2) of the Charter): see recital No 14; 
- amendment No 11 (aggregation of hours in cases involving several employment contracts): see recital No 2; 
- amendment No 12 (addition of a provision concerning compatibility between work and family life): see Article 2b; 
- amendment No 13 (deletion of Article 16b(2)): see Article 16; 
- amendments Nos 16 and 18 (compensatory rest time): see Articles 17(2) and 18(3); 
- amendment No 17 (correction of an error): see the first indent of Article 17(5); 
- amendment No 19 (reference period): see Article 19; 
- amendment No 24 (provision concerning the validity of opt-out agreements signed prior to the entry into force of this Directive): see Article 22(1c). 
By contrast, the Commission cannot accept at this stage the other amendments proposed by the Parliament. Some of them do not constitute an improvement to the Directive or are not acceptable from a strictly legal point of view. Others might, in the Commissionâ€™s view, disrupt the balance of the initial text and make it more difficult to obtain an agreement or a sufficient majority in the Council. 
The Commission is conscious of its role in the codecision procedure as an intermediary between the two arms of the Community legislature. 
Among the amendments not accepted by the Commission it should be noted that, with regard to amendment No 20 (on the individual opt-out), the Commission has clearly indicated that, while unable to accept it as it is, it is prepared to explore a possible compromise on this question which is dividing the co-legislators. Furthermore, with regard to amendment No 10 (concerning on-call time), the Commission also pointed out that it shares the concerns of the European Parliament with regard to the health and safety of workers who are regularly on call and that it would add a provision to ensure that inactive periods of on-call time are not taken into account with regard to the daily and weekly rest period. 
2004/0209 (COD) 
Amended proposal for a 
DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
amending Directive 2003/88/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 137(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,[5] 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee,[6] 
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions,[7] 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty,[8] 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 137 of the Treaty lays down that the Community supports and supplements the activities of the Member States with a view to improving the working environment to protect workers' health and safety. Directives adopted on the basis of the aforementioned Article must avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in such a way as to hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings. 
(2) Directive 2003/88/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 4 November 2003, concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time,[9] establishes minimum requirements concerning the organisation of working time, notably on daily and weekly rest, breaks, maximum weekly working time, annual leave and certain aspects of night work, shift work and patterns of work. These minimum requirements apply to all workers as defined in Article 3a of Directive 89/391/EEC.[10] 
(3) Two provisions of Directive 2003/88/EC have a clause providing for a review before 23 November 2003. They are Article 19 and Article 22(1). 
(4) More than ten years after the adoption of Council Directive 93/104/EC,[11] the initial Directive concerning the organisation of working time, it has become necessary to take into consideration modernise Community legislation on working time, with a view to responding better to new realities and demands from both employers and workers and provide the resources to meet the growth and employment objectives laid down by the European Council on 22 and 23 March 2005 in the context of the Lisbon strategy . 
(5) Reconciliation of work and family life is also an essential element for achieving the objectives set by the Union in the Lisbon strategy , particularly for increasing the rate of employment amongst women . The aim is not only to create a more satisfactory working environment, but also to respond better to workers' demands, in particular those with family responsibilities. A number of amendments introduced in Directive 2003/88/EC , particularly with regard to Article 22, are intended to permit greater compatibility between work and family life. 
(6) In this context, the Member States should encourage the social partners to conclude agreements at the appropriate level establishing rules for improving compatibility between working life and family life. 
(7) There is a need to strengthen strike a new balance between the protection of workers' health and safety and the need for greater flexibility in organising working time, particularly with regard to on-call time and, more specifically, inactive periods during on-call time , and also to strike a new balance between reconciling work and family life on the one hand and a more flexible organisation of working time on the other . 
(8) The provisions on the reference period must also be re-examined, with the objective of simplifying existing arrangements in order to adapt them to the needs of employers and employees. 
(9) The experience gained in the application of Article 22(1) shows that the purely individual decision not to be bound by Article 6 of the Directive can be problematic with regard to the protection of workers' health and safety and the freedom of choice of the worker. 
(10) In accordance with Article 138(2) of the Treaty, the Commission consulted the social partners at Community level on the possible direction for Community action in this field. 
(11) Following this consultation, the Commission considered that Community action was desirable and consulted the social partners again on the content of the envisaged proposal, in accordance with Article 138(3) of the Treaty. 
(12) Following this second phase of consultation, the social partners at Community level did not inform the Commission of their wish to initiate the process which could lead to the conclusion of an agreement, as set out in Article 138(4) of the Treaty. 
(13) Given that the objectives of the planned action, which consists of modernising Community legislation concerning the organisation of working time, cannot be achieved sufficiently by the Member States and may therefore be better realised at Community level, the Community may take measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary for the attainment of those objectives. 
(14) This Directive respects fundamental rights and observes the principles specifically recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, it seeks to ensure full respect of the right to fair and equitable working conditions referred to in ( Article 31 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ) , and in particular paragraph 2 thereof, which lays down that "every worker has the right to limitation of maximum working hours, to daily and weekly rest periods and to an annual period of paid leave" . 
(15) In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality referred to in Article 5 of the Treaty, the objectives of the action envisaged above cannot be achieved adequately by the Member States, in so far as this involves modifying a Community legal act in force.
