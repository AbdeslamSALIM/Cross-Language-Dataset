2. BEARING IN MIND that the financial implications of the proposed improvements, and in particular of the proposal establishing a Rapid Response and Preparedness Instrument for major emergencies, must be compatible with the financial framework set for the period 2007-2013 and respect the principle of subsidiarity. 
3. REAFFIRMS the need to develop an European Union rapid response capability to tackle natural or man-made disasters inside or outside the Union, drawing on national resources and teams trained to work together. 
4. WELCOMES in general the Communication from the Commission on Improving the Community Civil Protection Mechanism, which sets out short term and medium term proposals to strengthen European cooperation in the framework of the Civil Protection Mechanism. 
5. INVITES the Commission together with the Member States to improve, within their respective competences, the European civil protection cooperation, including the strengthening of the Community Civil Protection Mechanism, in order to ensure that the European Union can provide civil protection assistance rapidly and effectively in case of all kinds of emergencies inside and outside the Union. 
6. UNDERLINES the overall role and responsibility of the United Nations in coordinating international civil protection assistance in third countries, where present. The EU should support the capabilities of the United Nations in coordinating civil protection interventions in third countries. In this regard, the European rapid response capability could contribute to the strengthening of the UN capacity building for rapid action in the face of humanitarian disasters. 
7. ENCOURAGES the Commission together with the Member States, within their respective competences, to further develop a modular approach through a program which will establish scenarios, capability assessment, operational plans, training and exercises and common methodologies for risk assessment under an all-hazard approach covering natural and man-made disasters, including terrorism. This program should drive action, building on the principles of subsidiarity and complementarity, and of operating under national responsibility. The civil protection identified modules are one in a number of significant assets in the EU rapid response capability and will be able to operate independently or in cooperation with or support to other EU bodies or international institutions. 
8. STRESSES that evaluations, taking into account risk assessments, deficit analyses and lessons learned from emergencies, training and exercises, are the basis for decisions on improving the response capacity of the EU. 
9. ENCOURAGES the Commission and the Member States to take forward, in the short term, work in the following priority areas: 
(a) further assess the civil protection capabilities which the Member States may make available to each other for all types of major disasters; 
(b) develop a rapid response capability based on the civil protection modules of the Member States and for that purpose establish a program building on the principles of subsidiarity and complementarity, the modules being independent and self-sufficient units operating under national responsibility, which could be used alone or in addition with other contributions; 
(c) further develop training activities, exercises and the exchange of experts to stimulate the capacity to work together and to promote interoperability; 
(d) develop at the latest by 31 December 2005, in addition to national insignia, common EU insignia for intervention and assessment/coordination personnel on site; 
(e) further develop civil-military cooperation with the EU Military Staff, in particular the Civil-Military Cell; 
(f) strengthen the on site assessment of needs by developing a common assessment methodology, based on internationally agreed methodologies where they exist, and by reinforcing the assessment capacity; 
(g) strengthen the capacity to facilitate the coordination on site and at head quarters, both within the EU and with relevant international organizations; 
(h) reinforce the links between the Mechanism and early warning systems at EU and UN level; 
(i) further work on facilitating the transport of civil protection assistance.
