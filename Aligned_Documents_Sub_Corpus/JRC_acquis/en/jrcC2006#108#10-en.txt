Form of order sought 
- On the basis that the state of the proceedings so permits, give a substantive ruling confirming the appellants' entitlement to compensation arising out of the defendants' liability for an unlawful act or for a lawful act; 
- in any event, order the defendants to pay the costs both of these proceedings and those before the Court of First Instance; 
- in the alternative, grant the appellants fair compensation as a result of the unreasonable length of the procedure before the Court of First Instance; 
- grant such further and other relief as fairness might require. 
Pleas in law and main arguments 
The appellants submit that the judgment under appeal is defective in that it fails totally to state grounds concerning one of the principal arguments raised, namely, that in the specific factual circumstances of the case, the appellants are entitled to rely on the decision adopted by the Appeal Board of the World Trade Organisation to establish unlawful conduct on the part of the Community for the purpose of their claim for compensation.
