THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 150/95 (2), and in particular Article 6(2) thereof, 
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 introduces new agri-monetary arrangements as from 1 January 1993; whereas, within the framework of that Regulation, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 of 30 April 1993 on detailed rules for determining and applying the agricultural conversion rates (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1482/96 (4), determines the operative events for the agricultural conversion rates to apply after the transitional measures provided for in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3820/92 (5), without prejudice to further details to be specified or to derogations to be provided for, where appropriate, by regulations covering the product groups concerned on the basis of the criteria set out in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92; whereas the operative events for the agricultural conversion rates to apply after the transitional measures provided for in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 3820/92 to products in the fruit and vegetables sector, processed fruit and vegetable products and to certain aid for live plants and floricultural products should accordingly be determined and grouped within a single regulation; 
Whereas new common organisations of markets were introduced by Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 (6), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2520/97 (7), for fruit and vegetables and by Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 (8), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2199/97 (9), for processed fruit and vegetable products;whereas the operative events determined by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1445/93 (10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3434/93 (11), should be adapted to this new situation, and the aforesaid Regulation (EEC) No 1445/93 should be repealed; 
Whereas Annexes I and II to Commission Regulation (EC) No 412/97 of 3 March 1997 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as regards the recognition of producer organisations (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1493/97 (13), determine, pursuant to Article 11(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, the minimum volumes of marketable production required of recognised producer organisations; whereas these are annual volumes; whereas, pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92, the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate for these volumes should be 1 January of the relevant year; 
Whereas Article 15(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 lays down the conditions in which Member States may set a maximum level for the supplement to the Community withdrawal compensation paid by the operational funds; whereas the operative event applicable to the corresponding withdrawal compensation should be applied to the rate of conversion of this maximum level; 
Whereas in order to determine the Community financial assistance provided for in Article 15(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, it is necessary to express in ecus the value of marketed production of producer organisations, the estimated amount of operational funds, the actual financial contributions from member producers to operational funds and the expenditure on operational programmes as defined in Articles 7 and 9 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/97 of 3 March 1997 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as regards operational programmes, operational funds and Community financial assistance (14) as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1501/97 (15); whereas these are annual amounts; whereas, pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92, the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate for these volumes should be defined as 1 January of the relevant year; 
Whereas the fourth indent of Article 10(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 provides that in the case of withdrawals of products in the fruit and vegetables sector the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate is to occur on the first day of the month in which the withdrawal takes place; whereas that rule should apply not only to withdrawals pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, but also, because related or similar operations are involved, to the maximum sorting and packing costs defrayed in accordance with Article 30(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, for apples and citrus fruits distributed free in the conditions of Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 659/97 of 16 April 1997 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as regards intervention arrangements in the fruit and vegetables sector (16), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1946/97 (17), and to the flat-rate aid provided for the 1997/98 marketing year under Article 15a of the said Regulation (EC) No 659/97, to cover packing of certain products withdrawn from the market for free distribution; whereas Article 10(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 may be applied to aid towards the cost of transport of fruit and vegetables distributed free provided for, pursuant to Article 30(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 659/97; 
Whereas Article 2(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 of 21 December 1994 on detailed rules for the application of the import arrangements for fruit and vegetables (18), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2375/96 (19), provides that prices recorded in accordance with Article 2(2) shall, where they are established at the wholesaler/retailer stage, be reduced by an amount equal to ECU 0,7245 per 100 kilograms; whereas the provisions of Article 12(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 should be applied in this case by analogy; 
Whereas the provisions of Article 7 and Article 12(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 apply to the calculation of the standard import value referred to in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3223/94; 
Whereas for the purpose of applying Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 ('invoice method`), the entry price of the lot concerned must be expressed in ecus; whereas conversion must be effected in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 and Article 18 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (20), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 82/97 (21); whereas by analogy with Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93, the rates applicable must be those in force on the date of acceptance of the customs declaration; 
Whereas the export refund provided for in Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 is included in the arrangements for trade with third countries introduced by Title V of that Regulation; whereas it is therefore covered by Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93; 
Whereas Article 55 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides for aid to the hazelnut sector; whereas the detailed rules for the application of that aid, laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1474/97 (22), provide that it shall be granted to producer organisations, for the products taken over by them; whereas, in view of the large number of producers, pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 and notwithstanding Article 10(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93, the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate should be the first day of the month of take over of the products by the producer organisations concerned; 
Whereas Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 provides for a system of production aid for certain processed fruit and vegetable products; whereas that system provides for the granting of aid to the processor subject to payment of a minimum price to the producer; whereas, under those conditions and owing to the very large number of operators, processors and producers involved, pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 and notwithstanding Article 10(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93, the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate should be the first day of the month of take over of the products by the processor; 
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 525/77 of 14 March 1977 establishing a system of production aid for tinned pineapple (23), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1699/85 (24), introduces an aid scheme for processors subject to payment of a minimum price to pineapple producers; whereas, since there are two harvests in each marketing year, the operative event applicable to each harvest should be fixed at the beginning of the harvest in question; 
Whereas Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 provides for aid for the cultivation of certain varieties of grapes intended for the production of dried grapes; whereas the amount of the aid is fixed per hectare; whereas Article 11(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 should apply to that aid; 
Whereas Article 10(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 should apply to storage of sultanas, currants and dried figs as referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 and in particular to the minimum price referred to in Article 9(2) and to the storage aid referred to in Article 9(4); 
Whereas the amount in ecus in Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 627/85 of 12 March 1985 on storage aid and financial compensation for unprocessed dried grapes and figs (25), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1922/95 (26), represents the residual value of the stocks of dried figs and dried grapes at the date of the stocktaking referred to in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 627/85; whereas the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate applicable to that amount must be that date; 
Whereas Article 10(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 may be applied to sales of unprocessed dried grapes and figs held by storage agencies, at prices fixed in advance in ecus in accordance with Article 9(7) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96; 
Whereas the arrangements for sales organised by invitation to tender, pursuant to Article 9(7) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96, of unprocessed dried grapes and figs held by storage agencies were laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 626/85 (27), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1437/97 (28); whereas Article 13(2)(c) of the said Regulation (EEC) No 626/85 provides that the price offered shall be expressed in the currency of the Member State whose storage agency has issued the invitation to tender; whereas Article 15 of that Regulation provides that minimum selling prices may be fixed in the light of the tenders received; whereas the same agricultural conversion rate should be applied to prices offered and to minimum selling prices; whereas the same agricultural conversion rate should be applied to prices offered and to minimum selling prices; whereas notwithstanding Article 10(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93, the operative event for that rate should be the closing date for the submission of tenders laid down pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 626/85; 
Whereas the second indent of Article 12(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 should apply to the securities referred to in the second indent of Article 9(3) and the second indent of Article 9(7) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96; 
Whereas Article 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 provides for the granting of temporary flat-rate aid expressed in ecus per hectare, for the production of asparagus for processing; whereas the detailed rules for the application of this aid, laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 956/97 (29), provide that it shall be granted in 1997, 1998 and 1999; whereas Article 11(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 applies to this aid; whereas in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 659/97, the marketing year for asparagus runs from 1 January to 31 December; 
Whereas the minimum import price for dried grapes and certain processed cherries and the countervailing charge provided for in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 the export refund provided for in Article 16 of that Regulation, and the export levy on certain products containing added sugar provided for in Article 20 of that Regulation are part of the arrangements for trade with third countries introduced by Title II of that Regulation; whereas they are therefore covered by Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93; 
Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 (30) introduces a Community aid scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits; whereas that scheme provides aid to producer organisations for lemons, grapefruit, oranges, mandarins, clementines and satsumas supplied to processors under contracts; whereas, under those conditions and owing to the very large number of operators, processors and producers involved, pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 and notwithstanding Article 10(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93, the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate should be the first day of the month of take over of the products by the processor; whereas that date is the day of delivery at the processing plant as attested to in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1169/97 (31) laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2202/96; 
Whereas Title IIa of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables (32), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1363/95 (33), provided for specific measures for nuts and locust beans; whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 was repealed by Regulation (EC) No 2200/96; whereas, however, Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that any rights acquired by producer organisations in application of Title IIa of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 shall be maintained until exhausted; whereas, pursuant to Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2159/89 of 18 July 1989 laying down detailed rules for applying the specific measures for nuts and locust beans provided for in Title IIa of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 (34), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1363/95, the aid to improve the quality and marketing of nuts and locust beans provided for in Article 14d(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 is to be paid at the end of each annual reference period; whereas, pursuant to Article 11(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93, the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate applicable to the maximum aid in question, fixed in Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 790/89 (35), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1825/97 (36), should accordingly be 1 January of each annual reference period; 
Whereas Article 2(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1991/92 of 13 July 1992 establishing a special scheme for raspberries intended for processing (37), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1363/95, provides for a one-off flat-rate grant to producer organisations; whereas, pursuant to paragraph 3 of that Article, the grant is to be calculated on the basis of the production of the producer organisation during the first marketing year following special recognition; whereas the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate applicable to the grant should therefore be the first day of that marketing year; 
Whereas Article 6(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1991/92 provides for the granting of aid to producer organisations for carrying out programmes to improve the competitiveness of the sector producing raspberries for processing and fixes the maximum amount thereof per hectare per year; whereas the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate applicable each year to that aid should therefore be the beginning of the marketing year in question;
