The Decision ensured the continuation of traditional flows of trade in live animals and animal products between the Andorra and the Community. 
2. The Decisions No 1/2001[2] and No 2/2003[3] of the EC-Andorra Joint Committee set down further rules to implement this Protocol and to extend the area of harmonised trade. 
3. At a meeting on 25 and 26 January 2005 the EC-Andorra veterinary subgroup considered an extension of the Protocol on veterinary matters, to include areas of veterinary legislation not previously covered and applicable to any new flow in live animals and animal products that may develop. The veterinary subgroup recommended to the EC-Andorra Joint Committee the attached draft Decision which contains additional Community legislation Andorra should adopt and apply by, at the latest, 18 months after adoption of the Decision by the Joint Committee. 
4. The draft Decision includes legislation relating to food safety, animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals, identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals and animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption. 
The draft Decision lays down the legislation to be adopted and any additional measures that Andorra must take to ensure a correct application of this legislation. 
5. The Commission recommends that the Council adopt the attached draft Decision as a Community position, with a view to a Joint Committee Decision.
