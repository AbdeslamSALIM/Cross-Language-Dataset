For the application of IEC 60079 part 14 [6], the following classification shall be used: 
Permanently energized electrical equipment including the leads that are not subject to paragraphs 5.1.1.3 and 5.1.1.4 shall meet the requirements for zone 1 for electrical equipment in general or meet the requirements for zone 2 for electrical equipment situated in the driver’s cab. The requirements for explosion group IIC, temperature class T6, shall be met. 
However, for permanently energized electrical equipment installed in an environment where the temperature caused by non-electrical equipment situated in that environment exceeds the T6 temperature limit, the temperature classification of the permanently energized electrical equipment shall be at least that of the T4 temperature class. 
5.1.1.5.2. Bypass connections to the battery master switch for electrical equipment which must remain energized when the battery master switch is open shall be protected against overheating by suitable means, such as a fuse, a circuit breaker or a safety barrier (current limiter). 
5.1.1.6. Provisions concerning that part of the electrical installation situated to the rear of the driver's cab 
The whole installation shall be so designed, constructed and protected such that it cannot provoke any ignition or short-circuit under normal conditions of vehicle use and that these risks can be minimized in the event of an impact or deformation. In particular: 
5.1.1.6.1. Wiring 
The wiring located to the rear of the driver’s cab shall be protected against impact, abrasion and chafing during normal vehicle operation. Examples of appropriate protection are given in the figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 below. However, the sensor cables of antilock braking devices do not need additional protection. 
5.1.1.6.2. Lighting

5.1.2.2. Vehicle cab 
5.1.2.2.1. Only material not readily flammable shall be used in the construction of the driver's cab. This provision will be deemed to be met if, in accordance with the procedure specified in ISO standard 3795:1989, samples of the following cab components have a burn rate not exceeding 100 mm/min: seat cushions, seat backs, safety belts, head lining, opening roofs, arm rests, all trim panels including door, front, rear and side panels, compartment shelves, head restraints, floor coverings, sun visors, curtains, shades, wheel housing covers, engine compartment covers, mattress covers and any other interior materials, including padding and crash-deployed elements, that are designed to absorb energy on contact by occupants in the event of a crash. 
5.1.2.2.2. Unless the driver's cab is made of materials which are not readily flammable, a shield made of metal or other suitable material of the same width as the tank shall be fitted at the rear of the cab. Any window in the rear of the cab or in the shield shall be hermetically closed and made of fire resistant safety glass with fire resistant frames. Furthermore, there shall be a clear space of not less than 15 cm between the tank and the cab or the shield.

The exhaust system as well as the exhaust pipes shall be so directed or protected to avoid any danger to the load through heating or ignition. Parts of the exhaust system situated directly below the fuel tank (diesel) shall have a clearance of at least 100 mm or be protected by a thermal shield. 
5.1.2.6. Vehicle endurance braking 
Vehicles equipped with endurance braking systems emitting high temperatures placed behind the rear wall of the driver's cab shall be equipped with a thermal shield securely fixed and located between this system and the tank or load so as to avoid any heating, even local, of the tank shell or the load. In addition, the thermal shield shall protect the braking system against any outflow or leakage, even accidental, of the load. For instance, a protection including a twin-shell shield shall be considered satisfactory. 
5.1.2.7. Combustion heaters 
5.1.2.7.1. (Reserved) 
5.1.2.7.2. The combustion heaters and their exhaust gas routing shall be designed, located, protected or covered so as to prevent any risk of unacceptable heating or ignition of the load. This requirement shall be considered as fulfilled if the fuel tank and the exhaust system of the appliance conform to provisions similar to those prescribed for fuel tanks and exhaust systems of vehicles in paragraphs 5.1.2.3 and 5.1.2.5 respectively. 
5.1.2.7.3. The combustion heaters shall be put out of operation by at least the following methods: 
(a) Intentional manual switching off from the driver's cabin; 
(b) Unintentional stopping of the vehicle engine; in this case the heating device may be restarted manually by the driver; 
(c) Start up of a feed pump on the motor vehicle for the dangerous goods carried. 
5.1.2.7.4. Afterrunning is permitted after the combustion heaters have been put out of operation. For the methods of paragraphs 5.1.2.7.3 (b) and (c) above the supply of combustion air shall be interrupted by suitable measures after an afterrunning cycle of not more than 40 seconds. 
Only heaters shall be used for which proof has been furnished that the heat exchanger is resistant to the reduced afterrunning cycle of 40 seconds for the time of their normal use. 
5.1.2.7.5. The combustion heater shall be switched on manually. Programming devices shall be prohibited. 
5.1.2.7.6. Combustion heaters with gaseous fuels are not permitted.
