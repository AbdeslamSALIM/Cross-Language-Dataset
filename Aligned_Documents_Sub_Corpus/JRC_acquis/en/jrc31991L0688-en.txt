6. By way of derogation from paragraph 4, in the event of classical swine-fever occurring in a third country which fulfils the conditions of paragraph 4, it may be decided, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 29, that the period of 12 months referred to in the first indent of paragraph 4 may be reduced to six months if:
