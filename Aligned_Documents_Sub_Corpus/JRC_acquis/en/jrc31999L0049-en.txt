Council Directive 1999/49/EC of 25 May 1999 amending, with regard to the level of the standard rate, Directive 77/388/EEC on the common system of value added tax 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 1999/49/EC 
of 25 May 1999 
amending, with regard to the level of the standard rate, Directive 77/388/EEC on the common system of value added tax 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 93 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3), 
(1) Whereas Article 12(3)(a) of sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment(4), lays down that the Council shall decide on the level of the standard rate to be applied after 31 December 1998; whereas the standard rate of value added tax is fixed by each Member State as a percentage of the taxable amount and is the same for the supply of goods and for the supply of services; whereas from 1 January 1993 until 31 December 1998, this percentage may not be less than 15 %; 
(2) Whereas experience has shown that the standard rate of value added tax currently in force in the various Member States, combined with the mechanism of the transitional system, have ensured that this transitional system has functioned satisfactorily; whereas it seems therefore appropriate, with regard to the standard rate, to maintain the current level of the minimum rate for a further period of time; 
(3) Whereas, however, the Commission report on rates highlighted the fact that distortions of competition exist and are likely to be accentuated by the introduction of the single currency; whereas the period of application of the standard rate should be limited to two years in order to enable the Council at a later stage to decide on the levels of both the standard rate and reduced rate or rates, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
