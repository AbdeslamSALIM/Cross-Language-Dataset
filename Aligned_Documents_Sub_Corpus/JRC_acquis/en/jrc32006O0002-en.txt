THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, 
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and in particular Article 5.1 and 5.2, Article 12.1 and Article 14.3 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2103/2005 of 12 December 2005 amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 as regards the quality of statistical data in the context of the excessive deficit procedure [1] inter alia revises the deadlines for reporting data in the context of the EDP to ensure their consistency with the deadlines of the European System of Accounts 95 (ESA 95) [2] transmission programme. As a result of this revision, from 2006 Member States will be obliged to report data in the context of the EDP before 1 April and 1 October of each year.

The deadlines in Article 4 of Guideline ECB/2005/5 for the biannual reporting of complete data sets by national central banks (NCBs) to the European Central Bank (ECB) therefore need to be revised.
