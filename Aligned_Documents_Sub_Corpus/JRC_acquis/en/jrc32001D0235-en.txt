ANNEX 
TURKEY: 2000 ACCESSION PARTNERSHIP 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The European Council in Helsinki (10 and 11 December 1999) welcomed the positive developments in Turkey as well as its intention to continue its reform towards complying with the Copenhagen criteria. Turkey is a candidate State destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria as applied to the other candidate States. 
At its meeting in Helsinki, the European Council decided that an Accession Partnership will be drawn up %quot%on the basis of previous European Council conclusions%quot%. It shall contain priorities on which accession preparations must concentrate in the light of the political and economic criteria and the obligations of a Member State combined with a national programme for the adoption of the acquis. 
At its meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, the European Council had decided that the Accession Partnership would be the key feature of the enhanced pre-accession strategy, mobilising all forms of assistance to the candidate countries within a single framework. In this manner, the EU targets its assistance towards the specific needs of each candidate so as to provide support for overcoming particular problems in view of accession. 
In full compliance with this approach, the Commission proposed on 26 July 2000 a regulation for the establishment of a single framework for coordinating all sources of EU financial assistance to Turkey for pre-accession and in particular on the establishment of an Accession Partnership. This framework regulation for Turkey is modelled on the Regulation for the 10 central and eastern European candidate countries. (Council Regulation (EC) No 622/98 (OJ L 85, 20.3.1998, p. 1). 
The first Accession Partnership will be provided for in a Council Regulation on the establishment of an Accession Partnership for Turkey. This Accession Partnership is proposed by the Commission, after consulting Turkey and on the basis of the principles, priorities, intermediate objectives and conditions decided by the Council. It takes into account the analysis in the 2000 regular report of the progress made by Turkey towards membership. 
2. OBJECTIVES 
The purpose of the Accession Partnership is to set out in a single framework the priority areas for further work identified in the Commission's 2000 regular report on the progress made by Turkey towards membership of the European Union, the financial means available to help Turkey implement these priorities and the conditions which will apply to that assistance. This Accession Partnership provides the basis for a number of policy instruments, which will be used to help the candidate States in their preparations for membership. It is expected that Turkey on the basis of this Accession Partnership adopts before the end of the year a national programme for the adoption of the acquis. This is not an integral part of this Partnership but the priorities it contains should be compatible with it. 
3. PRINCIPLES 
The main priority areas identified for each candidate State relate to its ability to take on the obligations of meeting the Copenhagen criteria which state that membership requires: 
- that the candidate State has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, 
- the existence of a functioning market economy, as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union, 
- the ability to take on the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union. 
At its meeting in Madrid, the European Council stressed the need for the candidate States to adjust their administrative structures to ensure the harmonious operation of Community policies after accession. At Luxembourg, it stressed that incorporation of the acquis into legislation is necessary, but not in itself sufficient; it is necessary to ensure that it is actually applied. 
At its meeting in Helsinki, the European Council reaffirmed the inclusive nature of the accession process comprising 13 candidate States within a single framework. The candidate States are participating in the accession process on an equal footing. The European Council stated that they must share the values and objectives of the European Union as set out in the Treaties. In this respect the European Council stressed the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the United Nations Charter and urged candidate States to make every effort to resolve any outstanding border disputes and other related issues. Failing this they should within a reasonable time bring the dispute to the International Court of Justice. 
The European Council also concluded that it will review the situation relating to any outstanding disputes, in particular concerning the repercussions on the accession process and in order to promote their settlement through the International Court of Justice, at the latest by the end of 2004. 
Furthermore, the European Council emphasised that Turkey will benefit from a pre-accession strategy to stimulate and support its reforms including an enhanced political dialogue, with emphasis on progressing towards fulfilling the political criteria for accession with particular reference to human rights, as well as the issues referred to in paragraphs 4 and 9(a) of the Helsinki conclusions; in this spirit, the European Union encourages Turkey, together with all parties, to continue to support the UN Secretary General's efforts to bring the process, aiming at a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem, to a successful conclusion. 
4. PRIORITIES AND INTERMEDIATE OBJECTIVES 
The Commission's regular reports have highlighted the extent of the efforts which still have to be made in certain areas by the candidate States to prepare for accession. This situation requires the definition of intermediate stages in terms of priorities, each to be accompanied by precise objectives to be set in collaboration with the States concerned, the achievement of which will condition the degree of assistance granted and the progress of the negotiations under way with some countries and the opening of new negotiations with the others. The priorities and intermediate objectives in the Accession Partnership are divided into two groups - short and medium term. Those listed under the short term have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that Turkey can complete or take them substantially forward by the end of 2001. The priorities listed under the medium term are expected to take more than one year to complete although work should, wherever possible, also begin on them during 2001. 
The Accession Partnership indicates the priority areas for Turkey's membership preparations. Turkey will nevertheless have to address all issues identified in the regular report. It is also important that Turkey fulfils the commitments of legislative approximation and implementation of the acquis in accordance with the commitments made under the Association Agreement, customs union and related decisions of the EC-Turkey Association Council for example on the trade regime for agricultural products. It should be recalled that incorporation of the acquis into legislation is not in itself sufficient; it will also be necessary to ensure that it is actually applied to the same standards as those which apply within the Union. In all of the areas listed below there is a need for credible and effective implementation and enforcement of the acquis. 
Drawing on the analysis of the Commission's Regular Report, the following short- and medium-term priorities and intermediate objectives have been identified for Turkey:

5. PROGRAMMING 
During the period 1996 to 1999, Turkey received EUR 376 million in grant aid which represents an annual average of just over EUR 90 million. From 2000 onwards the yearly allocation to Turkey has been set at 15 % of the MEDA bilateral appropriation in addition to the funds foreseen in the framework of the two European strategy/pre-accession strategy Regulations. The first Regulation, adopted in April 2000, foresees EUR 5 million a year during three years in order to implement measures to intensify the EC-Turkey customs union. The second Regulation, in the process of adoption, relates to the implementation of measures to promote economic and social development in Turkey, and will provide EUR 45 million per year for three years. 
All these funds will be pre-accession oriented. In 2000 the repartition is as follows: 
- 50 % of appropriations will be dedicated for structural and sector reforms aiming in particular at harmonising Turkish legislation and practices with the EU acquis. Reforms will be supported through structural adjustment facilities; the objective is to help Turkey undertake major structural reforms in line with the %quot%acquis communautaire%quot% and in close coordination with the IMF and the World Bank. 
- 50 % of appropriations will finance other measures aiming at Turkey's integration into the EU: to help the Turkish administration and institutions to develop the capacity to implement the Community acquis (through institution building); to help Turkey to mobilise the investment needed to bring its industry and infrastructure up to Community standard (through investment support and regional/rural development). Under this allocation, Turkey can also fund part of its participation in Community programmes and agencies including in the fifth research and technical development framework programme (OJ L 26, 1.2.1999, p. 1) and in the areas of education and SMEs. 
5.1. Role of international financial institutions 
Cooperation between Turkey and the international financial institutions is receiving an impetus and a new focus through the Accession Partnership. The grant resources made available under the Accession Partnership serve as seed money and a catalyst for larger amounts of development finance from the IFIs. This process is developed by the Commission in liaison with the candidate countries, the EIB and the IFIs, in particular the World Bank with a view to facilitating the co-financing of projects relating to pre-accession priorities. At the same time, it is important that close cooperation takes place with the programmes of other donors (Member States; non-member countries). 
6. CONDITIONALITY 
Community assistance for financing projects through the pre-accession instruments for Turkey is conditional on respect by Turkey of its commitments under the Association Agreement, customs union and related decisions of the EC-Turkey Association Council, for example on the trade regime for agricultural products. Further steps towards satisfying the Copenhagen criteria and in particular progress in meeting the specific priorities of this Accession Partnership in 2001 need to be taken. Failure to respect these general conditions could lead to a decision by the Council on the suspension of financial assistance on the basis of Article 4 of the proposed single-framework Regulation. 
7. MONITORING 
The implementation of the Accession Partnership will be monitored in the framework of the Association Agreement. As underlined by the European Council in Helsinki, for Turkey it is important that the institutions of the Association Agreement continue to be the framework within which the adoption of the acquis can be examined, in accordance with the same arrangements, irrespective of whether or not negotiations have been opened. 
The relevant sections of the Accession Partnership will be discussed in the appropriate subcommittee. The Association Committee discusses overall developments, progress and problems in meeting its priorities and intermediate objectives as well as more specific issues referred to it from the subcommittees. 
To begin with, the MEDA Management Committee ensures that financing decisions under the three instruments (MEDA; two Financial Regulations under the European strategy) are compatible with each other as well as with the Accession Partnership. 
The Commission is preparing a new single regulation for the implementation of the new budget line %quot%Pre-accession strategy for Turkey%quot% (preliminary draft budget 2001). After the adoption of that regulation, the PHARE Management Committee is to ensure the task of monitoring the compatibility with the Accession Partnership.
