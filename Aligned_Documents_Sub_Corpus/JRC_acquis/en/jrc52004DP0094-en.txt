Verification of credentials 
European Parliament decision on the verification of credentials (2004/2140(REG)) 
The European Parliament, 
- having regard to the Act of 20 September 1976 [1] concerning the election of the members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, 
- having regard to Rules 3, 4 and 9 of and Annex I to its Rules of Procedure, 
- having regard to the official notifications from the competent authorities of the Member States concerning the results of the elections to the European Parliament, 
- having regard to the disputes concerning the validity of the election of certain Members of the European Parliament, 
- having regard to the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs (A6-0043/2004), 
A. whereas Articles 7(1) and (2) of the Act of 20 September 1976 specify the offices that are incompatible with the office of Member of the European Parliament, 
B. whereas, under Rule 9 of and Annex I to the Rules of Procedure, Members are required to make a detailed declaration of their professional activities and any other remunerated functions or activities, 
C. whereas all of the Member States have notified the European Parliament of the names of the elected candidates, although some have still not forwarded — or have done so belatedly — the lists of any substitutes together with their ranking in accordance with the results of the vote, as is required under Rule 3(2) of the Rules of Procedure, 
D. whereas in some cases Member States provided partial notification of elected candidates and included them only subsequently, with the result that not all Members of the European Parliament were able to take their seats at its constituent sitting, 
E. whereas in some Member States disputes relating to the election of some Members of Parliament are being considered in accordance with national legislation and whereas these procedures could result in the annulment of the election of the Members concerned, 
F. whereas, pursuant to Article 12 of the Act of 20 September 1976, the European Parliament is required to rule on any disputes concerning the validity of the mandate of its Members only where these relate to breaches of the provisions of the abovementioned Act, and not in the case of breaches of the national electoral provisions to which the Act refers, 
G. whereas the amendments made to the Act of 20 September 1976 by Council Decision 2002/772/EC, Euratom of 25 June 2002 and 23 September 2002 have highlighted the inadequacy of the provisions contained in Rules 3 and 4 of the Rules of Procedure, particularly as regards the adoption of measures for the verification of cases of clear incompatibility (in accordance with Article 7 of the Act of 20 September 1976) with effect from the European Parliament's constituent sitting, 
1. Declares valid, subject to any decisions by the competent authorities of Member States in which the election results have been disputed, the mandate of the Members of the European Parliament listed in Annex I to this decision whose election has been notified by the competent national authorities and who have made the written declarations required on the basis of Article 7(1) and (2) of the Act of 20 September 1976 and Annex I to the Rules of Procedure; 
2. Declares the disputes received regarding the validity of the election of certain Members of the European Parliament to be inadmissible and unfounded, for the reasons set out in Annex II in relation to each dispute; 
3. Repeats its request to the competent national authorities not only to notify the European Parliament of the names of the elected candidates, but also to forward the names of any substitutes together with their ranking in accordance with the results of the vote; 
4. Calls on the competent authorities of the Member States to notify the European Parliament without delay of the names of the elected Members so that all Members of Parliament can take their seats with effect from the constituent sitting; 
5. Calls on the competent authorities of the Member States to complete as soon as possible the examination of the disputes submitted to them and inform the European Parliament of the outcome; 
6. Instructs its President to refer to the committee responsible the question of the amendment of Rules 3 and 4 of the Rules of Procedure in order for them to be adapted to the Act of 20 September 1976, as amended, and for provisions to be laid down that will enable Parliament to act on any clear cases of incompatibility, so that all Members of Parliament can take their seats with effect from the constituent sitting; 
7. Instructs its President to forward this decision to the competent national authorities and the parliaments of the Member States. 
[1] OJ L 278, 8.10.1976, p. 5. Act as last amended by Decision 2002/772/EC, Euratom (OJ L 283, 21.10.2002, p. 1).

ANNEX II 
Summary of disputes referred 
Disputes referred: 
Elias NIKOLOPOULOS, Greek, on behalf of the DI.K.KI Party complains that the party was excluded from the recent elections to the European Parliament in Greece. Specifically, the party's list of candidates was rejected by the First Civil Chamber of the Greek Court of Cassation for failure to meet the requirements of Greek law concerning the legitimisation of persons presenting lists. 
As the dispute concerns a breach of national provisions, it should be deemed inadmissible pursuant to Article 12 of the 1976 Act. 
Mr Christopher SCIBERRAS, Maltese, who stood as a candidate in the elections, complains of alleged irregularities in the European Parliament elections in Malta. He complains in particular of the difference in the treatment accorded to small and large parties as regards provision of information on amendments to legislation on the ceilings for election expenses for individual candidates and the impossibility of securing access on equal terms to radio and television broadcasting slots. His complaint to the Maltese Electoral Commission regarding this matter has been rejected. 
As the dispute concerns matters relating to breaches of national provisions and not of the provisions of the 1976 Act, it should be considered inadmissible pursuant to Article 12 of the 1976 Act. 
Mr Juan Pedro PÉREZ BARRERA, Spanish, objects to the election of a Spanish Member of Parliament. The facts of the case in no way concern the provisions of the 1976 Act and the dispute should therefore be deemed inadmissible pursuant to Article 12 thereof. 
Mr Stanislav PECKA, Czech, who stood as a candidate in the elections, complains about the deficient law on elections to the European Parliament, other electoral laws and the law on elections to the Czech Senate. 
As the dispute concerns matters relating to breaches of national provisions and not of the provisions of the 1976 Act, it should be considered inadmissible pursuant to Article 12 of the 1976 Act. 
Mr Friedrich Wilhelm MERCK, German, chairman of the Commission of European Federalists for the European Constitution, is objecting to the election of Members of the European Parliament in the Federal Republic of Germany on the Greens list (Die Grünen). He complains that the Green list has infringed Article 1(3) of the 1976 Act, and in particular the principle of direct universal suffrage. The list provides for alternation between female candidates (in the odd number positions) and male candidates (in the even number positions) thereby giving the former an advantage over the latter. The division of the two sexes into quotas is not based on the principle of equality since, while male candidates could under no circumstances secure an odd number position on the list, female candidates would still be able to secure the even number positions reserved for male candidates. 
It should be noted in this respect that the principle of universal suffrage does not appear to be restricted in any way. That principle concerns the right of all Union citizens to vote and stand in elections without discrimination. In the case in point, the rules adopted by a political party or even a free association of citizens to compile a list for elections to the European Parliament involving procedures designed to ensure a fair balance between male and female candidates in no way undermines the universality of the right to vote, since citizens of the Union and the Member State may submit several lists before the poll and subsequently choose one of those submitted, regardless of criteria regarding gender balance or the ranking of male and female candidates. 
Furthermore, the measures actually taken to secure a balance between the sexes on the electoral list are fully in line with the principle of equal opportunities widely accepted by the Member States and set forth in Article 23 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Far from being a merely formal provision, this principle authorises and indeed seeks to promote the adoption of measures to accord specific advantages to the under-represented sex. There is no doubt that, as the European Parliament has repeatedly pointed out, the percentage of female Members of Parliament is still well below half of the total number. 
Accordingly, the dispute should be considered unfounded pursuant to Article 12 of the 1976 Act. 
Mr Tadeus ANDZEJEVSKI, Lithuanian, candidate in the elections, objects to the way in which the European Parliament seats have been allocated in Lithuania. He complains in particular that the list "Together we are strong", representing a coalition of regional parties of the Polish and Russian minorities, was not allocated a single seat, despite exceeding the 5% threshold for the allocation of seats laid down by Lithuanian electoral law, whereas Lithuania's 13 seats were divided up among six other lists. He maintains that the allocation of seats made by the Central Electoral Commission was in breach of Article 3 of the 1976 Act according to which, "Member States may set a minimum threshold for the allocation of seats. At national level this threshold may not exceed 5% of votes cast". 
In addition to Article 3, it should be pointed out that Article 1(1) of the Act stipulates that the election, using the list system or the single transferable vote, must be based on proportional representation. This is binding as regards the Member States laws, although they may introduce a minimum threshold for the allocation of seats (up to 5% of the votes cast at national level) in order to avoid fragmentation of the electorate. However, it does not seem possible to interpret Article 3 of the Act as meaning that any list which exceeds the 5 % threshold should be automatically allocated at least one seat, since in the case of Member States with a small number of seats (fewer than 20, as is the case for Lithuania), the mere fact of exceeding the minimum threshold does not imply, for simple arithmetical reasons, the automatic obtaining of a seat. 
In the final analysis and in the light of the documentation submitted, the complaint cannot be seen as justified and there are no grounds for not validating the mandate of the Members whose election has been notified by Lithuania. 
The dispute should therefore be considered unfounded pursuant to Article 12 of the 1976 Act.
