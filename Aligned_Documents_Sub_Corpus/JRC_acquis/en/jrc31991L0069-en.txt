Council Directive 91/69/EEC of 28 January 1991 amending Directive 72/462/EEC on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine animals and swine, fresh meat or meat products from third countries, in order to include ovine and caprine animals 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 28 January 1991 amending Directive 72/462/EEC on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine animals and swine, fresh meat or meat products from third countries, in order to include ovine and caprine animals (91/69/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 
thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas Directive 91/68/EEC (4) lays down the veterinary inspection conditions governing intra-Community trade in ovine and caprine animals; whereas in order to enable that trade to develop harmoniously, common rules should be laid down as regards imports from third countries; 
Whereas Directive 72/462/EEC (5), as last amended by Directive 90/425/EEC (6), lays down health and veterinary inspection requirements for the importation of bovine animals and swine, fresh meat or meat products from third countries; 
Whereas ovine and caprine animals belong, together with bovine animals, to the Bovidae family and are susceptible to the same diseases; whereas the Community's livestock is thus exposed to a similar risk in respect of imports from third countries; whereas reference should therefore generally be made to the rules laid down in Directive 72/462/EEC, subject to any changes which may be required in the light of the special characteristics of ovine and caprine animals, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Directive 72/462/EEC is hereby amended as follows:
