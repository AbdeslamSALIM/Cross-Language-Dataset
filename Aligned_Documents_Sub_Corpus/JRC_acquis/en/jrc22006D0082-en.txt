The Commission shall in particular provide initial training of Bulgarian officials for use of the RAPEX application. 
Article 4 
Any problems that may arise from the application of this Decision shall be solved through direct contacts between the Commission services and the Bulgarian authorities in the context of RAPEX. Whenever this does not lead to a mutually acceptable solution, an exchange of views shall take place in the Association Council at the request of one Party within three months following the request. 
Following this exchange of views, or after expiry of the period referred to in the above subparagraph, the Association Council may make appropriate recommendations for the settlement of those problems.
