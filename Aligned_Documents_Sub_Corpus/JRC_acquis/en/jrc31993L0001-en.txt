TRACE ELEMENTS 
Method 9.1 
EXTRACTION OF TOTAL TRACE ELEMENTS 
1. SCOPE 
This method defines the procedure for extracting the following trace elements: total boron, total cobalt, total copper, total iron, total manganese, total molybdenum and total zinc. The aim is to carry out the minimum number of extractions, making use wherever possible of the same extract to determine the total level of each of the trace elements listed above. 
2. FIELD OF APPLICATION 
This procedure concerns EEC fertilizers covered by Council Directive 89/530/EEC (1) containing one or more of the following trace elements: boron, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum and zinc. It is applicable to each trace element the declared content of which is less than or equal to 10 %. 
3. PRINCIPLE 
Dissolution in boiling dilute hydrochloric acid. 
Note: The extraction is empirical and may not be quantitative depending on the product or the other constituents of the fertilizer. In particular, in the case of certain manganese oxides, the quantity extracted may be substantially smaller than the total quantity of manganese which the product contains. It is the responsibility of the fertilizer manufacturers to ensure that the declared content actually corresponds to the quantity extracted under the conditions pertaining to the method. 
4. REAGENTS 
4.1. Dilute hydrochloric acid (HCI) solution, about 6 M: 
Mix 1 volume of hydrochloric acid (r = 1,18 g/ml) with 1 volume of water. 
4.2. Concentrated ammonia solution (NH4OH, r = 0,9 g/ml) 
5. APPARATUS 
Electric hotplate with variable temperature control. 
Note: Where the boron content of an extract is to be determined, do not use borosilicate glassware. As the method involves boiling, teflon or silica is preferable. Rinse the glassware thoroughly if it has been washed in detergents containing borates. 
6. PREPARATION OF THE SAMPLE 
See Method 1 (Directive 77/535/EEC, OJ No L 213, 22. 8. 1977, p. 1). 
7. PROCEDURE 
7.1. Test sample 
Take a quantity of fertilizer weighing between 2 and 10 g depending on the declared content of element in the product. The following table shall be used to obtain a final solution which, after appropriate dilution, will be within the measuring range for each method. Samples should be weighed to within 1 mg. 
/* Tables: see OJ */ 
Place the sample in a 250 ml beaker. 
7.2. Preparation of the solution 
If necessary moisten the sample with a little water, add 10 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid (4.1) per gram of fertilizer carefully, in small amounts, then add about 50 ml of water. Cover the beaker with a watchglass and mix. Bring to the boil on the hotplate and boil for 30 minutes. Allow to cool, stirring occasionally. Transfer quantitatively to a 250 or 500 ml volumetric flask (see Table). Make up to volume with water and mix thoroughly. Filter through a dry filter into a dry container. Discard the first portion. The extract must be perfectly clear. 
It is recommended that the determinations be carried out without delay on aliquot portions of the clear filtrate, if not the containers should be stoppered. 
Remark: Extracts in which the boron content has to be determined: Adjust the pH to between 4 and 6 with concentrated ammonia (4.2). 
8. DETERMINATION 
The determination of each trace element is to be carried out on the aliquot portions indicated in the method for each individual trace element. 
If necessary, remove organic chelating or complexing substances from an aliquot portion of the extract by using Method 9.3. In the case of determination by atomic absorption spectrometry, such removal may not be necessary. 
Method 9.2 
EXTRACTION OF WATER-SOLUBLE TRACE ELEMENTS 
1. SCOPE

2. FIELD OF APPLICATION 
This procedure concerns EEC fertilizers covered by Directive 89/530/EEC containing one or more of the following trace elements: boron, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum and zinc. It is applicable to each trace element the declared content of which is less than or equal to 10 %. 
3. PRINCIPLE 
The trace elements are extracted by shaking the fertilizer in water at 20 °C ± 2 °C. 
Note: The extraction is empirical and may or may not be quantitative. 
4. REAGENTS 
4.1. Dilute hydrochloric acid (HCI) solution, about 6 M: 
Mix 1 volume of hydrochloric acid (r = 1,18 g/ml) with 1 volume of water.

6. PREPARATION OF THE SAMPLE 
See Method 1 (Directive 77/535/EEC, (OJ No L 213, 22. 8. 1977, P. 1)). 
7. PROCEDURE 
7.1. Test sample 
Take a quantity of fertilizer weighing between 2 and 10 g depending on the declared content of the element in the product. The following table shall be used to obtain a final solution which, after appropriate dilution, will be within the measuring range for each method. The samples should be weighed to within 1 mg. 
/* Tables: see OJ */ 
Place the sample in a 250 or 500 ml flask (according to the Table). 
7.2. Preparation of the solution 
Add about 200 ml of water to the 250 ml flask or 400 ml of water to the 500 ml flask. 
Stopper the flask well. Shake vigorously by hand to disperse the sample, then place the flask on the shaker and shake for 30 minutes. 
Make up to volume with water and mix thoroughly. 
7.3. Preparation of the test solution 
Filter immediately into a clean, dry flask. Stopper the flask. Carry out the determination immediately after filtering. 
NB: If the filtrate gradually becomes cloudy, make another extraction following 7.1 and 7.2 in a flask of volume Ve. Filter into a calibrated flask of volume W which has previously been dried and has received 5,00 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid (4.1). Stop the filtration at the exact moment when the calibration mark is reached. Mix thoroughly. 
Under these conditions the value of V in the expression of results is: 
V = Ve × W / (W 5). 
The dilutions in the expression of results depend on this value of V. 
8. DETERMINATION 
The determination of each trace element is carried out on the aliquot portions indicated in the method for each individual trace element. 
If necessary, remove organic chelating or complexing substances from an aliquot portion by using Method 9.3. In the case of determination by atomic absorption spectrometry, such removal may not be necessary.

Then add 5 ml of the hydrogen peroxide solution (4.2). Cover with a watchglass. Allow oxidation to occur at room temperature for about one hour, then bring gradually to boiling and boil for half an hour. If necessary, add a further 5 ml of the hydrogen peroxide to the solution once it has cooled. Then boil to remove the excess hydrogen peroxide. Allow to cool and transfer quantitatively to a 50 ml volumetric flask and make up to volume. Filter where necessary. 
Account should be taken of this dilution when taking aliquot portions and calculating the percentage of trace element in the product. 
Method 9.4

6.2. Treatment of the test solution 
Dilute an aliquot portion of the extract obtained by Method 9.1, 9.2 or 9.3 with water and/or hydrochloric acid (4.1) or (4.2) so as to obtain, in the final solution for measurement, a concentration of the element to be determined that is appropriate to the calibration range used (7.2) and a hydrochloric acid concentration of at least 0,5 M and not more than 2,5 M. This operation may require one or more successive dilutions.
