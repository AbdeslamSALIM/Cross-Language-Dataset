THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 32/2000 of 17 December 1999 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas bound in GATT and certain other Community tariff quotas and establishing detailed rules for adjusting the quotas and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1808/95(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 811/2002(2), and in particular Article 9(1)(a) thereof,

The tariff quotas opened for these products in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 32/2000 have therefore become redundant and must be closed from 31 December 2002. That Annex must therefore be amended.
