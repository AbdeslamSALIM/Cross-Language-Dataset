THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community [1], and in particular the sixth subparagraph of Article 13c(5) thereof. 
Whereas: 
(1) Directive 2000/29/EC provides for a Community financial contribution to be granted to Member States in order to strengthen inspection infrastructures for plant-health checks on plants and plant products coming from third countries. 
(2) Germany and Portugal have each established a programme to strengthen their inspection infrastructure for checks on plants and plant products coming from third countries. They have applied for the allocation of a Community financial contribution for 2006 for those programmes in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 998/2002 of 11 June 2002 establishing detailed rules for the implementation of the provisions relating to the allocation of a Community financial contribution for Member States in order to strengthen inspection infrastructures for plant health checks on plants and plant products coming from third countries [2]. 
(3) The technical information provided for by Germany and Portugal has enabled the Commission to analyse the situation accurately and comprehensively. The Commission has prepared a list of eligible inspection posts strengthening programmes, which give details of the amount of the proposed Community financial contribution to each programme. The information has also been examined by the Standing Committee on Plant Health. 
(4) Each programme included in that list has been individually assessed for approval. The Commission has concluded that the conditions and criteria set out in Directive 2000/29/EC and Regulation (EC) No 998/2002 for the grant of a Community financial contribution have been met. 
(5) Accordingly, it is appropriate to allocate a Community financial contribution to cover the expenditure of those programmes for 2006 by Germany and Portugal. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,
