amending Regulation (EC) No 1799/2001 laying down the marketing standard for citrus fruit 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), and in particular Article 2(2) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1799/2001(2), lays down, among others, provisions concerning maturity of oranges. 
(2) The Working Party on Standardisation of Perishable Produce and Quality Development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) decided to recommend, within UN/ECE standard FFV-14 concerning marketing and commercial quality control of citrus fruit, new provisions concerning maturity of oranges for fruit showing more than one fifth of the total surface of green colour and that are produced in climatic areas such that fruit can be mature even when still of green colour. 
(3) UN/ECE standard FFV-14 does not include any provision with regard to degreening procedures authorised by Member States, procedures that are covered by the provisions of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant-protection products on the market(3). In addition, no rule for uniformity in size is laid down for mandarins of a size over size 1. It is therefore necessary to amend the table laying down the maximum difference in diameter between the largest and the smallest fruit in the package. 
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1799/2001 shall be amended accordingly. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,
