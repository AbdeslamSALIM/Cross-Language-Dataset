2. The producer organisations shall be those referred to in Article 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. The Greek authorities shall lay down the criteria that the producer groups must satisfy to qualify for the aid in question, and notify them to the Commission. 
Article 3 
1. Applications for the per-hectare aid shall be lodged by interested parties with the competent Greek authorities during the period fixed by them and by 1 May of each year, at the latest, for the following wine year.
