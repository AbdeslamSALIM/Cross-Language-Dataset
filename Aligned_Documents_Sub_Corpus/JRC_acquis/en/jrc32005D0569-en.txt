THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities and the conditions of employment of other servants of the Communities laid down by Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 [1], and in particular the second paragraph of Article 13 of Annex X thereto, 
Having regard to the Treaty of Accession of the 10 new Member States, and in particular Article 33(4) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 257/2005 [2] fixed, pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 13 of Annex X to the Staff Regulations, the weightings to be applied from 1 July 2004 to the remuneration payable in the currency of the country of employment of officials, temporary staff and contract staff of the European Communities serving in third countries and of certain officials remaining in post in the 10 new Member States for a maximum period of 15 months after accession.
