Commission Regulation (EC) No 2082/2004 
of 6 December 2004 
amending Regulation (EC) No 216/96 laying down the rules of procedure of the Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 20 December 1993 on the Community trade mark [1], and in particular Article 157(3) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Regulation (EC) No 422/2004 amended Regulation (EC) No 40/94 with regard, inter alia, to the organisation and procedures of the Boards of Appeal provided for in Articles 130 and 131. 
(2) Regulation (EC) No 422/2004 introduced, inter alia, the new post of President of the Boards of Appeal, created an enlarged Board of Appeal and laid down that, under certain conditions, decisions of the Boards of Appeal may be taken by a single member. It is therefore necessary to set out in detail the powers of the President of the Boards of Appeal, the composition and powers of the Boards of Appeal, the allocation of cases to the Boards of Appeal and the composition of the enlarged Board, cases to be referred to the enlarged Board and cases to be decided by a single member. 
(3) The practical operation of the Boards of Appeal has shown the need to make certain changes to their organisation and procedures, including changes to the role of the Registry and certain procedural aspects. Centralisation of the Registry and revision of its powers, and rules on exchanges of submissions between parties, are designed to ensure greater efficiency in the handling of cases by the Boards of Appeal. In order not to interfere with proceedings already pending when this Regulation enters into force, a transitional period must be provided for with respect to the exchange of submissions by the parties. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on fees, Implementation Rules and the Procedure of the Boards of Appeal of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (trade mark and designs), 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

2. If the case is referred to another Board, that Board shall not comprise members who were party to the contested decision. This provision shall not apply if the case is referred to the Grand Board."

If the Registrar sends the chairman of a Board of Appeal an opinion on the admissibility of an appeal in accordance with Article 5(3), second paragraph, the chairman of the Board in question may either suspend the proceedings and request the Board to rule on the admissibility of the appeal, or reserve judgement on the admissibility of the appeal for the decision to end the proceedings before the Board of Appeal. 
2. In inter partes proceedings, and without prejudice to Article 61(2) of the Regulation, the statement setting out the grounds of appeal and the response to it may be supplemented by a reply from the appellant, lodged within two months of the notification of the response, and a rejoinder by the defendant, lodged within two months of notification of the reply.
