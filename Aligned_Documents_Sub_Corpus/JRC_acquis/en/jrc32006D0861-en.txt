Commission Decision 
of 28 July 2006 
concerning the technical specification of interoperability relating to the subsystem "rolling stock — freight wagons" of the trans-European conventional rail system 
(notified under document number C(2006) 3345) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2006/861/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Directive 2001/16/EC of 19 March 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the conventional rail system [1], and in particular Article 6(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In accordance with Article 2(c) of Directive 2001/16/EC, the trans-European conventional rail system is subdivided into structural and functional subsystems. 
(2) In accordance with Article 23(1) of the Directive, the subsystem "rolling stock — freight wagons" needs to be covered by a technical specification for interoperability (TSI). 
(3) The first step in establishing a TSI is to have a draft TSI drawn up by the European Association for Railway Interoperability (AEIF) which was appointed as the joint representative body. 
(4) The AEIF has been given a mandate to draw up a draft TSI for the "rolling stock — freight wagons" subsystem in accordance with Article 6(1) of Directive 2001/16/EC. The basic parameters for this draft TSI were adopted by Commission Decision 2004/446/EC of 29 April 2004 specifying the basic parameters of the Noise, Freight Wagons and Telematics applications for freight Technical Specifications for Interoperability referred to in Directive 2001/16/EC [2]. 
(5) The draft TSI set up on the basis of the basic parameters was accompanied by an introductory report containing a cost-benefit analysis as provided for in Article 6(5) of the Directive. 
(6) The draft TSIs have been examined by the Committee set up by Council Directive 96/48/EC of 23 July 1996 on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system [3] and referred to in Article 21 of Directive 2001/16/EC, in the light of the introductory report. 
(7) Directive 2001/16/EC and the TSIs do apply to renewals but not to maintenance-related replacements. However Member States are encouraged, when they are able to do so and where it is justified by the scope of the maintenance-related work, to apply the TSIs to maintenance-related replacements. 
(8) The putting into service of new, renewed or upgraded wagons must also take into full consideration the impact on the environment; this includes the impact of noise. It is therefore important that the implementation of the TSI being the subject of this Decision is carried out in conjunction with the requirements of the Noise TSI, to the extent that the Noise TSI applies to freight wagons. 
(9) In its current version the TSI does not fully deal with all aspects of interoperability; the items which are not dealt with are classified as "Open Points" in Annex JJ of the TSI. Given that the verification of interoperability has to be established by reference to the requirements of the TSIs, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Directive 2001/16/EC, it is necessary, during the transition period between the publication of this Decision and the full implementation of the attached TSI, to lay down the conditions to be complied with in addition to those explicitly referred to in the TSI attached. 
(10) Individual Member States are to inform the other Member States and the Commission of the relevant national technical rules in use for achieving interoperability and meeting the essential requirements of Directive 2001/16/EC as well as of the bodies it appoints for carrying out the procedure for the assessment of conformity or suitability for use as well as the checking procedure in use for verifying the interoperability of subsystems within the meaning of Article 16(2) of Directive 2001/16/EC. For this latter purpose, Member States should apply, as far as possible, the principles and criteria provided for in Directive 2001/16/EC for the implementation of Article 16(2) in making use of the bodies notified under Article 20 of Directive 2001/16/EC. The Commission should carry out an analysis of the information forwarded by the Member States, in the form of national rules, procedures, bodies in charge of implementing procedures, and duration of these procedures, and, where appropriate, should discuss with the Committee the need for the adoption of any measures. 
(11) The TSI in question should not demand the use of specific technologies or technical solutions except where this is strictly necessary for the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system. 
(12) The TSI is based on best available expert knowledge at the time of preparation of the relevant draft. Developments in technology, operational, safety or social requirements may make it necessary to amend or supplement this TSI. Where applicable, a review or updating procedure should be initiated in accordance with Article 6(3) of Directive 2001/16/EC. 
(13) To encourage innovation and in order to take into account the experience acquired, the attached TSI should be subject to a periodical revision at regular intervals. 
(14) Where innovative solutions are proposed the manufacturer or the contracting entity shall state the deviation from the relevant section of the TSI. The European Rail Agency will finalise the appropriate functional and interface specifications of the solution and develop the assessment methods. 
(15) Freight wagons currently operate under existing national, bilateral, multinational or international agreements. It is important that those agreements do not hinder current and future progress towards interoperability. To this end, it is necessary that the Commission examine those agreements in order to determine whether the TSI presented in this Decision needs to be revised accordingly. 
(16) In order to avoid any confusion, it is necessary to state that the provisions of Decision 2004/446/EC which concern the basic parameters of the trans-European conventional rail system shall not apply anymore. 
(17) The provisions of this Decision are in conformity with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 21 of Directive 96/48/EC, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
A Technical Specification for Interoperability (TSI) relating to the "rolling stock — freight wagons" subsystem of the trans-European conventional system referred to in Article 6(1) of Directive 2001/16/EC is hereby adopted by the Commission. 
The TSI shall be as set out in the Annex to this Decision. 
The TSI shall be fully applicable to the freight wagon rolling stock of the trans-European conventional rail system as defined in Annex I to Directive 2001/16/EC, account being taken of Articles 2 and 3 of this Decision. 
Article 2 
1. With regard to those issues classified as "Open points" set out in Annex JJ of the TSI, the conditions to be complied with for the verification of the interoperability pursuant to Article 16(2) of Directive 2001/16/EC shall be those applicable technical rules in use in the Member State which authorise the putting into service of the subsystem covered by this Decision. 
2. Each Member State shall notify to the other Member States and to the Commission within six months of the notification of this Decision: 
(a) the list of the applicable technical rules mentioned in paragraph 1; 
(b) the conformity assessment and checking procedures to be applied with regard to the application of these rules; 
(c) the bodies it appoints for carrying out those conformity-assessment and checking procedures. 
Article 3 
Member States shall notify the following types of agreement to the Commission within six months of the entry into force of the attached TSI: 
(a) national, bilateral or multilateral agreements between Member States and railway undertakings or infrastructure managers, agreed on either a permanent or a temporary basis and necessitated by the very specific or local nature of the intended transport service; 
(b) bilateral or multilateral agreements between railway undertakings, infrastructure managers or safety authorities which deliver significant levels of local or regional interoperability; 
(c) international agreements between one or more Member States and at least one third country, or between railway undertakings or infrastructure managers of Member States and at least one railway undertaking or infrastructure manager of a third country which deliver significant levels of local or regional interoperability. 
Article 4 
Those provisions of Decision 2004/446/EC which concern the basic parameters of the trans-European conventional rail system shall no longer apply as from the date on which this Decision becomes applicable. 
Article 5 
This Decision shall become applicable six months after the date of its notification. 
Article 6 
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.

The clearance above the draw hook is viewed in Annex A fig. A7. 
If a combined automatic and screw coupler is fitted it is permissible for the auto coupler head to infringe the Berne rectangle on the left hand side (as viewed Annex A fig. A5) when it is stowed and the screw coupler is in use. 
There shall be a handrail under each buffer. The handrails shall withstand the loads, which are applied by the shunters while accessing the space between the buffers.

The structural design of wagon shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements of Section 3 of EN12663 and the structure shall meet the criteria defined in Clauses 3.4 to 3.6 of this standard . 
In addition to the criteria already identified, it is permissible to take the material elongation at failure into account in the selection of the safety factor defined in clause 3.4.3 of EN12663. Annex ZZ defines how the safety factor and permissible stress shall be determined. 
When performing fatigue life assessments it is important to ensure that the load cases are representative of the intended application and expressed in a manner consistent with the adopted design code. Any relevant guidelines on the interpretation of the selected design code shall be followed. 
The permissible stresses for the materials used in the construction of wagons shall be determined as specified in Section 5 of EN12663. 
The wagon structure shall be inspected at normal maintenance periods and remedial action taken if signs of significant damage, cracking or corrosion are found.

Requirements for fastening systems or devices such as spigots or securing rings are not mandatory in this TSI 
4.2.2.3.2. Exceptional Loads 
4.2.2.3.2.1. Longitudinal Design Loads 
Different values will apply for different kinds of freight wagons as identified in EN12663 namely: 
F-I: Wagons that may be shunted without restriction; 
F-II: Wagons excluded from hump or loose shunting. 
The basic structural design requirements assume that wagons in the above categories are fitted with buffers and couplers appropriate to the operations. 
The structure shall conform to the requirements of Clause 3.4 of EN12663 when subject to all exceptional load cases. 
The wagon bodies shall meet the longitudinal strength requirements as specified in tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 of EN12663 as appropriate, where the load paths exist.

4.2.2.3.2.2. Maximum Vertical Load 
The wagon body shall meet the requirements of table 8 of EN12663 modified as indicated in Note 1 below. 
The wagon body shall also be designed to carry the anticipated maximum loads due to the method of loading and unloading. It is permissible to define the load cases either in terms of forces or in terms of accelerations applied to the mass being added and to the mass of the body plus any existing payload. The design cases shall represent the most unfavourable cases that the operator wishes to consider associated with the use of the wagon (including foreseeable abuse). 
NOTE 1: The factor of 1,3 shall be used instead of 1,95 quoted in table 8 of EN 12663 and note "a" shall not apply. 
NOTE 2: Loads may be distributed uniformly over the full load-carrying surface, over a limited area or at discrete positions. The design case(s) shall be based on the most demanding applications. 
NOTE 3: If it is intended that wheeled vehicles (including fork-lift trucks etc.) will operate over the floor of the wagon then the design shall accommodate the maximum local pressure loading associated with such operations. 
4.2.2.3.2.3. Load combinations 
The structure shall also conform to the requirements of Clause 3.4 of EN12663 when subject to the most adverse load combinations as specified in Clause 4.4 of EN12663 . 
4.2.2.3.2.4. Lifting and Jacking 
The wagon body shall incorporate lifting points by which the whole wagon is capable of being safely lifted or jacked. It shall also be possible to lift one end of the wagon (including its running gear) with the other end resting on the remaining running gear.

For lifting cases associated only with rescue following derailment or other abnormal incident, where some permanent deformation of the structure is acceptable, it is permissible to reduce the load factor in Tables 9 and 10 from 1,1 to 1,0. 
If a factor of 1,0 is used for a validation test, the measured strains shall be extrapolated to demonstrate the conformance to the higher factor. 
The lifting shall occur via designated lifting points. The location of the lifting points shall be defined by the customer's operational requirements. 
4.2.2.3.2.5. Equipment Attachment (Including body/bogie) 
The attachments of equipment shall be designed either: 
- to carry the loads specified in tables 12, 13 and 14 of Section 4.5 of EN12663 
Or as an alternative 
- to be validated by carrying out an buffing test as described in Annex Z. 
4.2.2.3.2.6. Other Exceptional Loads 
The load requirements for structural parts of the wagon body, such as side and end wall structures, doors, stanchions and load restraint systems shall be designed to carry the maximum loads they will experience in performing their intended function. The load cases shall be determined using the principles for structural design given in EN12663. 
Annex YY provides suitable design requirements for common types of wagon features that are in general use. However they shall be used only where they are applicable. 
For new types of wagon the designer shall determine appropriate load cases to meet the specific requirements using the principles given in EN12663. 
4.2.2.3.3. Service (fatigue) Loads 
4.2.2.3.3.1. Sources of load input. 
All sources of cyclic loading that can cause fatigue damage shall be identified. In accordance with Clause 4.6 of EN12663, the inputs listed in Annex N shall be considered and the way in which they are represented and combined shall be consistent with the intended use of the freight wagon. The definition of the load cases shall also be consistent with the material fatigue design code to be used as described in Clause 5.2 and method of validation in Clause 6.3 of EN12663. Where the fatigue load cases act in combination, they shall be taken into account in a manner consistent with the characteristics of the loads and the form of design analysis and fatigue design code being employed. 
For most conventional wagon designs the loading defined in Table 16 of EN12663 can be considered as sufficient to represent the full effective combination of fatigue load cycles. 
Where detailed data are not available, Annex CC shall be used to determine the main sources of fatigue loading. 
4.2.2.3.3.2. Demonstration of fatigue strength 
In accordance with Clause 5.2 of EN12663, the behaviour of materials under fatigue loading shall be based on current European Standard, or alternative sources of equivalent standing, wherever such sources are available. Acceptable material fatigue design codes are Eurocode 3 and Eurocode 9 as well as the method described in Annex N. 
4.2.2.3.4. Stiffness of the main vehicle structure 
4.2.2.3.4.1. Deflections 
Deflections under the loads or load combinations shall not be such as to cause the wagon or its payload to exceed the permitted operational envelope (see Annex C and Annex T). 
Deflections shall also not impair the functionality of the wagon as a whole or that of any installed components or systems. 
4.2.2.3.4.2. Modes of vibration 
The design process shall take into account that the natural modes of vibration of the wagon body, in all loading conditions including tare, shall be separated sufficiently, or otherwise de-coupled from the suspension frequencies, so as to avoid the occurrence of undesirable responses at all operating speeds. 
4.2.2.3.4.3. Torsional stiffness 
The torsional stiffness of the wagon body shall be consistent with the suspension characteristics such that the derailment criteria are achieved in all loading conditions including tare. 
4.2.2.3.4.4. Equipment 
The natural modes of vibration of equipment, on its mountings, shall be separated sufficiently, or otherwise de-coupled from the wagon body or suspension frequencies, so as to avoid the occurrence of undesirable responses at all operating speeds. 
4.2.2.3.5. Securing of Freight 
Annex YY provides suitable design requirements for common types of features that are in general use. However they shall be used only where they are applicable. 
4.2.2.4. Doors closing and locking 
Doors and hatches of freight vehicles shall be designed to be closed and locked. This remains valid while the vehicles are in a moving train (unless this is part of the procedure for discharging the payload). For this, locking devices shall be used which indicate their status (open/closed) and they shall be visible by an operator outside the train. 
The locking devices shall be designed to be secured against unintentional opening during running. Closing and locking systems shall be designed so that the operating staff are not placed at undue risk. 
Suitable and clear instructions for use shall be applied near each locking device and shall be visible by the operator. 
The closing and locking devices shall be designed to withstand the loads which are caused by the payload under normal, regular conditions and when the payload has been displaced in a foreseeable manner. 
The closing and locking devices shall be designed to withstand the loads that occur while the vehicles are passing other trains under all conditions, including when in tunnels. 
The forces, which are needed to actuate the closing and locking devices, shall be of a magnitude that can be applied by an operator without additional tools. Exceptions are allowable when additional tools are specifically made available or when motor driven systems are used. 
The closing and locking systems shall be inspected at normal maintenance periods and remedial action taken if signs of damage or malfunction are found. 
4.2.2.5. Marking of freight wagons 
Markings are required on wagons to: 
- Identify each individual wagon by its unique number, as specified in the Traffic Operations and Management TSI, and recorded in the Register. 
- Provide information required to produce train consists, including brake mass, length over buffers, tare weight, speed versus load table for different line categories. 
- Identify operational restrictions to staff, including geographical limitations, and shunting restrictions. 
- Provide pertinent safety information for staff operating wagons or attending in an emergency, including overhead live wire and electrical equipment warning signs, lift/jacking points, vehicle specific safety instructions. 
These markings are listed in the Annex B and pictograms are included if required. The markings shall be located as high as practicable on the wagon structure up to a height of 1600 mm above rail level. Hazard signs shall be located in such a position that they can be seen before the hazard zone is actually reached. The markings of wagons that do not have vertical sides +/- 10 degrees, shall be affixed on special panels. 
Markings may be achieved either by painting or by decals. 
The requirements for Dangerous Goods Markings are covered by directive 96/49/EC with its valid Annex 
When changes to a wagon occur that require changes to the markings, such changes shall be consistent with changes to the data recorded in the Rolling Stock Register. 
Markings shall be cleaned/replaced when required to ensure that they remain legible. 
4.2.2.6. Dangerous goods 
4.2.2.6.1. General

4.2.3. VEHICLE TRACK INTERACTION AND GAUGING 
4.2.3.1. Kinematic gauge 
This section defines the maximum outside dimensions of wagons to ensure that they remain within the infrastructure gauge. To achieve this, the maximum possible movement of the wagon is considered; this is called the kinematic envelope. 
The kinematic envelope of the rolling stock is defined by means of a reference profile and its associated rules. It is obtained by applying the rules giving reductions in relation to the reference profile, which the various parts of the rolling stock shall meet. 
These reductions depend on: 
- the geometric characteristics of the rolling stock in question, 
- the position of the cross-section in relation to the bogie pivot or to the axles, 
- the height of the point considered in relation to the running surface, 
- constructional tolerances, 
- the maximum wear allowance, 
- the elastic characteristics of the suspension. 
The study of the maximum construction gauge takes into account both the lateral and vertical movements of the rolling stock, drawn up on the basis of the geometrical and suspension characteristics of the vehicle under various loading conditions. 
The construction gauge of rolling stock travelling on a given section of line shall be smaller, by an appropriate safety margin, than the minimum structure gauge of the line in question. 
A rolling stock gauge comprises two fundamental elements: a reference profile and the rules for that profile. It allows determination of the maximum dimensions of rolling stock and the position of fixed structures on the line. 
In order that a rolling stock gauge is applicable, the following three parts of that gauge shall be specified: 
- the reference profile; 
- the rules for determining the maximum construction gauge for the wagons; 
- the rules for determining the clearances to structures and the track spacing. 
Annex C specifies the reference profile and the rules for the maximum construction gauge for wagons. 
The associated rules for determining the clearances for installation of structures are covered in the Infrastructure TSI. 
All equipment and parts of wagons that give rise to transverse and vertical displacements shall be checked at appropriate maintenance intervals. 
In order to keep the wagon inside the kinematic gauge, the maintenance plan shall include provision for inspection of the following items: 
- wheel profile and wear, 
- bogie frame, 
- springs, 
- side bearers, 
- body structure, 
- constructional clearances, 
- maximum wear allowance, 
- elastic characteristics of the suspension, 
- axle guide wear , 
- elements that affect the vehicle flexibility coefficient, 
- elements that affect the roll centre. 
- Devices causing movements affecting the gauge 
4.2.3.2. Static axle load and linear load 
The axle load and axle spacing of the vehicles defines the vertical quasi-static load input to the track. 
The load limits for wagons take into account their geometrical characteristics, weights per axle and weights per linear metre. 
They shall be in accordance with the classification of lines or sections of lines, categories A, B1, B2, C2, C3, C4, D2, D3, D4 as defined in the table below. 
Axle loads higher than 22,5 tonnes are not specified in this TSI; existing national rules continue to apply to lines capable of accepting these higher axle loads. 
Classification | Mass per axle = P | 
| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | 
Mass per unit length = p | 16 t | 18 t | 20 t | 22,5 t | 25,0 t | 27,5 t | 30 t | 
5,0 t/m | A | B1 | | | | | | 
6,4 t/m | | B2 | C2 | D2 | | | | 
7,2 t/m | | | C3 | D3 | | | | 
8,0 t/m | | | C4 | D4 | E4 | | | 
8,8 t/m | | | | | E5 | | | 
10 t/m | | | | | | | | 
p = Mass per unit length, i.e. the wagon mass plus the mass of the load, divided by the wagon length in metres, measured over the buffers when non-compressed. 
P = Mass per axle. 
Annex D Table D.1 contains data from which a train made up of wagons with two 2-axle bogies is used in order to determine the category in which a line is classified. 
A line or section of line is classified in one of these categories when it is capable of handling an unlimited number of wagons with the weight characteristics shown in the table above. 
Classification according to the maximum mass per axle P is expressed in capital letters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G); classification according to the maximum mass per unit length p is expressed in Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), except for Category A. 
The lines thus classified are capable of handling the wagons listed below: 
- Two or three-axle wagons, and wagons with 2-axle bogies, where the measurements a and b are equal to or greater than the values shown in Annex D Table D.1, providing P and p do not exceed the values shown in the table above. 
- Two 2-axle bogie wagons where the measurements a and b are smaller than the values shown in Annex D Table D.2, providing they have reduced mass per axle, Pr. complying with the values given in Annex D Table D.3 in relation to the values of measurements a and b. 
- Two bogie wagons, with 3 or 4 axles per bogie, providing they have reduced mass per axle, Pr, complying with the values given in Annex D Tables D.4 and D.5 in relation to the values of dimensions a and b. 
- Wagons with three or four 2-axle bogies provided they have reduced mass per axle, Pr, not exceeding those defined in Annex D Table D.6 in relation to their geometrical characteristics and provided that they also comply with the special regulations governing these types of wagon. 
NOTE: - 2-axle long wagons with 14,10 m %lt% LOB (length over buffers) %lt% 15,50 m to bring their payload up to 25 t ; 
- wagons designed for 22,5 t axle-loads to offset the extra tare incurred in making them suitable for such axle-loads. 
Wagons having irregular axle spacings not conforming with Annex D Sections D .3, D.4, D.5) shall be subject to additional checks by calculation, to ensure that the maximum bending moments and shear forces on a single beam of any span length do not exceed the values calculated for the wagons defined in Annex D Section D.1). This shall be applied to an unlimited number of wagons. 
The maximum payload that can be carried by a wagon, from the point of view of track and structures, is the lowest value resulting from the following formulae: 
X = n × P - T 
Y = L × p - T 
Z = n × Pr - T 
where: 
n: number of axles of the wagon 
p: mass per unit length in t/m 
L: length over buffers in m 
T: wagon tare in t, rounded up to the first decimal place 
P: mass per axle in t 
Pr: reduced mass per axle in t 
The tare to be taken into account is the average tare, which shall be determined for the following groups of wagons within each major manufacturing series: 
- wagons with air brakes, 
- wagons with air brakes and a gangway fitted with a screw brake. 
The limits for modifications of freight wagons not requiring new approval are listed in Annex II. 
Annex D Sections D.6 and D.7 give the load limits for 2-axle wagons and the commonest types of two 2-axle bogie wagons (a = 1,80 m, b = 1,50 m (see definition in Annex D)) resulting from comparisons. 
The value X, Y or Z selected on the basis of the comparison is rounded down either to the nearest half-tonne or to the nearest tenth of a tonne, each contracting entity being free to select either of these alternatives depending on the type of wagon. 
However, for insulated, refrigerator or mechanically-refrigerated wagons, tank wagons and closed wagons used for carrying goods in powder form, the X, Y or Z value shall be rounded down to the nearest tenth of a tonne. 
The value to be marked on the wagon is not necessarily that established above. In cases where lower load limits exist as a result of the structural characteristics of the wagon or RID regulations (COTIF agreement Annex D Section D.3), it is these lower values that shall be indicated. 
Minimum wheelset load for wagons with: 
Generally with two axles or more | 5,0 t | 
4-axle and equipped with brake blocks | 4,0 t | 
Greater than 4-axle and equipped with brake blocks | 3,5 t | 
If permitted by the infrastructure register (e.g. specific case of "rollende Landstrasse") 
8-axles | 2,0 t | 
12- axles | 1,3 t | 
4.2.3.3. Rolling stock parameters which influence ground based train monitoring systems 
4.2.3.3.1. Electrical resistance: 
The electrical resistance of each wheelset measured across the treads of the two wheels shall not exceed 0,01 ohm for new or reassembled wheelsets incorporating new components. 
These resistance measurements are to be made using an applied voltage of 1,8 to 2,0 volts DC. 
4.2.3.3.2. Hot axle box detection 
Open point to be specified at the next revision of this TSI. 
4.2.3.4. Vehicle dynamic behaviour 
4.2.3.4.1. General 
The dynamic behaviour of a vehicle has strong effects on safety against derailment and running stability. The vehicle dynamic behaviour is determined by 
- the maximum speed 
- static track features (alignment, track gauge, cant, rail inclination, discrete and periodic track irregularities) 
- dynamic track features (horizontal and vertical track stiffness and track damping) 
- wheel/rail contact parameters (Wheel and rail profile, track gauge) 
- wheel defects (wheel flats, out of roundness) 
- mass and inertia of car body, bogies and wheelsets 
- suspension characteristic of the vehicles 
- distribution of the payload. 
In order to ensure safety and running stability, measurements in different operating conditions or comparison studies with a proven design (e. g. simulation/calculation) have to be carried out to assess the dynamic behaviour. 
Rolling stock shall have characteristics that enable stable running within the applicable speed limit. 
4.2.3.4.2. Functional and technical specifications 
4.2.3.4.2.1. Safety against derailment and running stability 
In order to ensure safety against derailment and running stability the forces between wheel and rail have to be limited. In particular, the forces in question are transverse track forces Y and vertical forces Q. 
- Lateral track force Y 
In order to prevent track shifts, interoperable Rolling stock shall comply with the Prud'homme criteria for the maximum transverse force 
(ΣY)lim = α (10 + P/3), where α = 0,85 and P = maximum static axle load 
or 
(H2m)lim ((H2m) is the floating mean value of the lateral force in an axle measured over 2m) 
This value will be determined by the TSI Infrastructure 
In curves, the limit of the quasi-static lateral force on the outer wheel is 
Yqst, lim 
This value will be determined by the TSI Infrastructure 
- Y/Q forces 
To limit the risk of wheel climb on the rail the quotient of lateral force Y and vertical load Q of a wheel shall not exceed 
(Y/Q)lim = 0,8 for large curves R ≥ 250 m 
(Y/Q)lim = 1,2 for small curves R %lt% 250 m 
- Vertical force 
The maximum dynamic vertical force exerted on the rail is 
Qmax 
This value will be determined by the TSI Infrastructure 
In curves the limit of the quasi-static vertical force on the outer wheel is 
Qqst, lim 
This value will be determined by the TSI Infrastructure 
4.2.3.4.2.2. Safety against derailment when running on twisted tracks 
Wagons are able to run on twisted tracks when (Y/Q) does not exceed the limit given in section 4.2.3.4.2.1 in a curve of radius R = 150m and for a given twisted track: 
for a wheel base of 1,3 m ≤ 2a* 
- g lim= 7 ‰ for 2a+ %lt%4m 
- g lim = 20/2a+ + 2 for 2a+%gt%4m 
- g lim=20/2a*+2 for 2a*%lt%20m 
- g lim=3 ‰ for 2a*%gt%20 m 
The wheelbase 2a* represents the axle spacing for 2-axle wagons or the distance between the pivot centres of a bogie wagon. The wheelbase 2a+ represents the axle spacing for a bogie. 
4.2.3.4.2.3. Maintenance rules 
The following key parameters essential for safety and running stability shall be maintained according to the maintenance plan: 
- suspension characteristics 
- body-bogie connections 
- tread profile 
The maximum and minimum dimensions for wheelsets and wheels for Standard Gauge are given in Annex E. 
Cases for other track gauges are found in Section 7. 
4.2.3.4.2.4. Suspension 
Suspension of freight wagons shall be designed such that the values specified in 4.2.2.1.2.2 and 4.2.2.1.2.3 are adhered to in the conditions "empty" and "laden to the load limit". The suspension calculation shall demonstrate that the suspension deflection is not exhausted when the wagons are fully loaded and considering dynamic influences. 
4.2.3.5. Longitudinal compressive forces 
4.2.3.5.1. General 
This parameter describes the maximum longitudinal compressive forces that can be applied on an interoperable freight wagon or an individual vehicle, or group of special coupled vehicles, of an interoperable train-set during a braking or a banking operation, without any risk of derailment. 
When subjected to Longitudinal Compressive Forces, the wagon shall continue to run safely. In order to ensure safety against derailment, the wagon or system of coupled wagons shall be assessed by tests, calculations or through comparison with the characteristics of already approved (certified) wagons. 
The longitudinal force that can be applied on a vehicle without derailing shall be higher than a threshold value depending on the vehicle design (two axle, bogie wagon, fixed group of vehicles, Combirail, Road- Railer™, etc.) fitted with UIC coupler or accepted central coupler or coupling rod/short couplers. 
The conditions to certify the wagons, fixed groups of wagons and coupled groups of wagons are given in section 4.2.3.5.2. 
The conditions that affect the maximum longitudinal compressive force that a wagon is capable of withstanding without derailment include: 
- cant deficiency 
- train and wagon braking system 
- system of draw gear and buffers on the wagons or specially coupled wagon-groups 
- design characteristics of the wagon 
- characteristics of the line 
- train driver's handling of the train, especially braking 
- wheel/rail contact parameters (wheel and rail profile, track gauge) 
- load distribution of the individual freight wagons 
Longitudinal compressive forces have a strong effect on safety against derailment of a vehicle. Therefore measurements in different operating conditions have been carried out to find the acceptable limits of longitudinal compressive force that can be applied on a vehicle without risk of derailment. To avoid testing wagons shall correspond with the characteristics of wagons that have been previously approved by national safety authorities or on their behalf, or to be built according to approved design characteristics of wagons and be fitted with approved components such as certified bogies 
The reference test is given in Section 6.2. Experience with different wagon-types has resulted in different methods of acceptance depending on factors such as tare weight, length, wheelbase, overhang, distance between pivots etc. 
4.2.3.5.2. Functional and technical specifications 
The subsystem shall withstand the longitudinal compressive forces in the train without derailing or damaging the vehicle. In particular the determining factors are 
- transverse wheel/rail forces -Y- 
- vertical forces -Q- 
- lateral forces on axle-boxes -Hij- 
- braking forces (due to wheel/rail contact, dynamic braking and different braking groups of the wagons and trains) 
- diagonal and vertical buffer forces 
- coupling forces ±Z 
- damping of buffer- and coupling forces 
- the result of coupler tightness 
- the result of coupler slack 
- jerks as a result of longitudinal movements in the trains and coupler slack 
- Wheel lift 
- Axle guide deflection 
Longitudinal Compressive Forces (LCF) are influenced by many factors. The different factors are given in the documents for construction and operating conditions of wagons to which it is necessary to certify wagons for normal traffic on different lines and under different conditions. 
With the objective to certify wagons for mixed traffic on the European Network, tests on a special testing track, and in running trains on different lines were performed in order to ensure that wagons can withstand a minimum longitudinal force, without derailing. The following definition was made: 
Wagons and rakes of wagons (with coupling rod/short coupler between the wagons) fitted with screw couplings and side-buffers at their outer ends, shall withstand a minimum longitudinal force measured in the conditions of the reference test of: 
- 200 kN for two-axle freight wagons with UIC coupling 
- 240 kN for freight wagons fitted with two-axle bogies with UIC coupling 
- 500 kN for freight wagons with all types of central bar couplers and without buffers 
For other coupling systems, limit values are not yet defined. 
The coefficient of friction of the buffer heads shall be such as to meet the requirements of this TSI in terms of maximum lateral forces. 
Maintenance rules: 
If the buffer heads have to be lubricated in order to ensure the required coefficient of friction, then the maintenance plan shall include provision for maintaining the coefficient of friction at this level. 
4.2.4. BRAKING 
4.2.4.1. Braking performance 
4.2.4.1.1. General 
The purpose of the train braking system is to ensure that the train's speed can be reduced or it can be stopped within the maximum allowable braking distance. The primary factors that influence the brake process are the braking power, the train mass, the speed, the allowable braking distance, the adhesion and the track gradient. 
Braking performance of a train or a vehicle is the result of the braking power available to retard the train within defined limits and all factors involved in the conversion and dissipation of energy including train resistance. Individual vehicle performance is defined so that the overall braking performance of the train can be derived. 
Vehicles shall be equipped with continuous automatic brake. 
A brake is continuous if it allows the transmission of signals and energy from central command unit to the whole train. 
A continuous brake is automatic, if it becomes effective immediately on the whole train with every inadvertent break of the control train line, e. g. brake-pipe. 
Where it is not possible to detect the state of the brake, an indicator showing the state shall be provided on both sides of the vehicle. 
The brake energy storage (e.g. supply reservoirs of indirect pneumatic air brake system, brake pipe air) and the brake energy used to build up the brake effort (e.g. air from brake cylinders of indirect pneumatic air brake system) shall be used only for braking use. 
4.2.4.1.2. Functional and Technical Specification 
4.2.4.1.2.1. Control train line 
The minimum propagation braking signal speed shall be 250 m/s. 
4.2.4.1.2.2 Braking Performance elements 
Braking performance shall take into account mean application time, instantaneous deceleration, mass and initial speed. Braking performance shall be determined by both deceleration profiles and by braked mass percentage. 
Deceleration profile: 
The deceleration profile describes the predicted instantaneous deceleration of the vehicle (at the level of a vehicle) or the train (at the level of a train) in normal conditions. 
Knowledge of individual vehicle deceleration profiles enables the calculation of the overall train deceleration profile. 
The deceleration profile includes the effect of: 
a) the response time between brake demand and reaching full brake effort. 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
Te is the equivalent build-up application time and is defined as: 
Te = t1 + (t2/2) 
For pneumatic brake the end of the time t2 corresponds to 95 % of established brake cylinder pressure. 
b) the corresponding function (deceleration = F(speed)) as defined as a succession of sections with a constant deceleration. 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
Note: a denotes the instantaneous deceleration and V the instantaneous speed 
Brake mass percentage: 
The brake mass percentage (lambda) is the ratio of the sum of the brake masses divided by the sum of the masses of the vehicles. 
The method of determining the brake mass/brake mass percentage shall remain applicable in addition to the method of deceleration profiles; the manufacturer shall supply these values. This information is required to be entered in the Rolling Stock Register. 
Braking power for an individual vehicle shall be determined in emergency braking for each braking mode (i.e. G, P, R, P + ep) available on the vehicle and for several loading conditions including at least tare and fully loaded. 
G braking mode: brake mode used for freight trains with specified brake application time and brake release time. 
P braking mode: brake mode for freight trains with specified brake application time and brake release time and specified brake mass percentage. 
R braking mode: brake mode for passenger trains and fast freight trains with specified brake application time and brake release time as for braking mode P and specified minimum brake mass percentage. 
Ep brake (indirect Electro-pneumatic brake): assistance to indirect air brake that uses an electrical command on the train and electro-pneumatic valves on the vehicle and thus starts operating more rapidly and less jerkily than the conventional air brake. 
Emergency braking: Emergency braking is a brake command that stops the train to ensure the specified level of safety without any brake system degradation. 
The minimum braking performance for brake-modes G and P: shall be in accordance with the following table: 
Braking Mode — Te range (s) | Wagon Type | Command Equipment | Load | Requirement for running speed at 100km/h | Requirement for running speed at 120km/h | 
| | | | Maxi | Mini | Maxi | Mini |

| "S1" [2] | Empty/ Load Device | Intermediate Load | S = 810 m λ = 55 % γ = 0,51m/s2 | Case A — composite blocks: S = 390 m, λ = 125 %, γ = 1,15 m/s2 Case B — other cases: S = 380 m, λ = 130 %, γ= 1,18 m/s2 | | | 
| | | LOADED (Maximum = 22,5 t/axle) | S = 700 m λ = 65 % γ = 0,60 m/s2 | Case A — Brake only on wheels (Brake blocks): S = greater of (S = 480 m, λ = 100 %, γ = 0,91 m/s2) or (S obtained with a mean retardation force of 16,5 kN per axle [5] . Case B — Other cases: S = 480 m, λ = 100 %, γ = 0,91 m/s2 | | |

Case B — Other cases: S = 700 m, λ = 100 %, γ = 0,88 m/s2 | 
Braking mode "G" — 9 ≤ Te≤ 15 s | | | | There shall be no separate assessment of the braking power of wagons in position G. A wagon's braked mass in position G shall be the same as braked mass in position P | | | 
This table is based on a reference speed of 100 km/h and an axle load of 22,5 t and 120 km/h and an axle load of 22,5 t. Higher axle loads can be accepted under specific operational conditions in accordance with national rules. The permitted maximum axle load shall be in accordance with the infrastructure requirements. 
If a wagon is equipped with a WSP, the above performance shall be achieved without activation of the WSP and according to the conditions in annex S. 
Other braking modes (example: R braking mode) are permitted according to national rules and the mandatory use of WSP as specified in § 4.2.4.1.2.6. 
Brake Pipe Emptying Accelerator valve 
If the brake pipe-emptying accelerator is separately installed on the wagon, it shall be capable of isolation from the brake pipe by a specific device. The wagon shall be clearly marked to indicate this isolation device, or this device shall be secured in an "open" position by a seal. 
4.2.4.1.2.3. Mechanical components 
The assembly of brake components shall be aimed to prevent any partial or full detachment of these components. 
- Slack adjuster 
A device to automatically maintain the design clearance between the friction pair shall be provided. 
A minimum of 15 mm clearance between the slack adjuster envelope and other components shall be provided. 
Provision shall be made for the necessary free clearances for the slack adjuster extremities and connections to be maintained at all times. 
For slack adjusters within a bogie, there is no special envelope. But, for all design conditions, the minimum clearance necessary between the slack adjuster and other components shall be ensured to prevent contact. Should a smaller clearance be required, the reasons why contact will not occur shall be demonstrated. 
- Pneumatic half coupling 
The opening of the automatic air brake coupling head shall face the left when looking at the end of the vehicle. The opening of the main reservoir coupling head shall face the right when looking at the end of the vehicle. 
The vehicles shall be fitted with devices to enable the unused couplings to be suspended at least 140 mm above rail level to prevent both damage and, as far possible, penetration of foreign bodies into the interior coupling. 
4.2.4.1.2.4. Energy storage 
The energy storage shall be sufficient to obtain during an emergency braking at maximum speed, whatever the loaded state of the vehicle, the maximum brake effort without any further supply of energy (e.g. for indirect compressed air brake system: Brake Pipe only without replenishment by main reservoir pipe). When a vehicle is equipped with WSP the above condition applies with the WSP fully operational (i.e. WSP air consumption). 
4.2.4.1.2.5. Energy limits: 
The brake system shall be designed to allow the vehicle to run on all existing lines of the trans-European conventional rail system.

2. Maintain a speed of 80 km/h in a slope with a mean declivity of 21 ‰ and a length of 46 km. (The south slope of St Gothard's line between Airolo and Biasca is the reference slope.) 
4.2.4.1.2.6. Wheel slide protection (WSP) 
Wheel slide protection (WSP) is a system designed to make the best use of available adhesion by a controlled reduction and restoration of the brake force to prevent wheelsets from locking and uncontrolled sliding, thereby optimising stopping distance. The WSP shall not alter the functional characteristics of the brakes. The vehicle's air equipment shall be dimensioned such that the air consumption of the WSP does not impair the performance of the pneumatic brake. The design process of the WSP shall take into account that the WSP shall not have a detrimental effect on the constituent parts of the vehicle (brake gear, wheel tread, axle boxes, etc). 
The following types of wagons shall be fitted with WSP: 
a) equipped with brake blocks made of cast iron or sintered material, for which the maximum mean utilisation of adhesion (δ)is greater than 12 %(Lambda ≥ 135 %).The maximum mean utilisation of adhesion is shown by calculating the mean adhesion (δ) from individual braking distances obtained from the possible range of vehicle mass. δ is therefore related to the measured braking distances necessary for determining the braking performance. (δ = f(V, Te, Stopping distance). 
b) equipped with disc brakes only, for which the maximum utilisation of adhesion (see above for the definition of the maximum utilisation of adhesion (δ)) is greater than 11 % and less than 12 % (125%lt%Lambda %lt%/= 135 %).. 
c) With maximum operating speed ≥ 160 km/h.

Handles or hand wheels shall be used to operate the parking brake, but only hand wheels may be used for brakes operated from the ground. Parking brakes that are accessible from the ground shall be available on both sides of the vehicle. Handles or hand wheels shall apply the brakes when they are turned in a clockwise direction. 
Where the parking brake controls are fitted inside a vehicle, they shall be accessible from both sides of the vehicle. Where the parking brake can be superimposed with other brake applications, either whilst moving or statically, the vehicle equipment shall be able to withstand the imposed loads for the life of the vehicle.

6. ASSESSMENT OF CONFORMITY AND/OR SUITABILITY FOR USE OF THE CONSTITUENTS AND VERIFICATION OF THE SUBSYSTEM 
6.1. INTEROPERABILITY CONSTITUENTS 
6.1.1. ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES 
The assessment procedure for conformity or suitability for use of interoperability constituents shall be based on European specifications or specifications approved in accordance with Directive 2001/16/EC. 
In the case of suitability for use, these specifications will indicate all the parameters to be measured, monitored or observed, and will describe the related testing methods and measuring procedures, whether in a test-bench simulation or tests in a real railway environment. 
The manufacturer of an Interoperability Constituent (IC) or his authorised representative established within the Community shall draw up an EC declaration of conformity or an EC declaration of suitability for use in accordance with Article 13.1 and Annex IV of the Directive 2001/16/EC before placing ICs on the market. 
The assessment procedures for conformity of ICs defined in Section 5 of this TSI shall be carried out by application of modules as specified in Section 6.1.2 
Assessment of conformity or suitability for use of an IC shall be carried out by a notified body, when indicated in the procedure, with which the manufacturer or its authorised representative in the Community has lodged the application 
The modules shall be combined and used selectively according to the particular constituent. 
The modules are defined in Annex Q of this TSI. 
The phases for the application of the conformity and suitability for use assessment procedures for the interoperability constituents as defined in Section 5 of this TSI are indicated in Annex Q, Table Q.1 to this TSI. 
6.1.2. MODULES 
6.1.2.1. General 
For the conformity assessment procedure of interoperability constituents within the rolling stock subsystem, the manufacturer or his authorised representative established within the Community may choose: 
a) the type-examination procedure (module B) for the design and development phase in combination with a module for the production phase: either the production quality management system procedure (module D), or the product verification procedure (module F), 
or alternatively 
b) the full quality management system with design examination procedure (module H2) for all phases, 
or 
c) the full quality management system procedure (module H1) 
Module D may only be chosen where the manufacturer operates a quality system for production, final product inspection and testing approved and surveyed by a notified body of its choice. Assessment of welding processes shall be carried out according to national rules. 
Module H1 or H2 may only be chosen where the manufacturer operates a quality system for design, production, final product inspection and testing, approved and surveyed by a notified body of its choice. 
The conformity assessment shall cover the phases and characteristics as indicated by "X" in the Table Q1 of Annex Q to this TSI. 
6.1.2.2. Existing solutions for Interoperability Constituents 
If a existing solution for an interoperability constituent is already on the European market before this TSI enters into force, then the following process applies. 
The manufacturer shall demonstrate that tests and verification of ICs have been considered successful for previous applications under comparable conditions. In this case these assessments shall remain valid in the new application. 
In this case, the type can be considered as already approved and an assessment of the type is not necessary. 
In accordance with assessment procedures for the different ICs, the manufacturer or its authorised representative established within the Community shall: 
- either apply the internal production control procedure (module A), 
- or apply the internal design control with production verification procedure (module A1), 
- or apply the full quality management system procedure (module H1). 
If it is not possible to demonstrate that the solution is positively proven in the past, the Section 6.1.2.1 applies. 
6.1.2.3. Innovative solutions for Interoperability Constituents 
When a solution proposed to be an Interoperability Constituent is innovative, as defined in the section 5.2, the manufacturer shall state the deviation from the relevant section of the TSI. The European Railway Agency shall finalise the appropriate functional and interface specifications of the constituents and develop the assessment methods. 
The appropriate functional and interface specifications and the assessment methods shall be incorporated in the TSI by the revision process. As soon as these documents are published, the assessment procedure of the interoperability constituents may be chosen by the manufacturer or his authorised representative established within the Community, as specified in the section 6.1.2.1 
After entry into force of a decision of the Commission, taken in accordance with Article 21(2) of Directive 2001/16/EC, the innovative solution may be used before being incorporated into the TSI. 
6.1.2.4. Assessment of suitability for use 
Whenever an assessment procedure is started based on in-service experience for an interoperability constituent within the rolling stock subsystem, the manufacturer or his authorised representative established within the Community shall apply the type validation of in service experience procedure (module V). 
6.1.3. SPECIFICATION FOR ASSESSMENT OF ICS 
6.1.3.1. Structures and mechanical parts

6.1.3.1.3. Marking of Freight Wagons 
The decals for marking are to be assessed against the specification contained in Annex B 
6.1.3.2. Vehicle track interaction and gauging 
6.1.3.2.1. Bogie and Running Gear 
The integrity of the structure of the body to bogie connection, bogie frame, axle-box and all attached equipment shall be assured. This assurance shall be generated by use of sufficient appropriate methods, such as demonstration by bench tests, validated modelling, comparison with an existing design approved by or on behalf of national approval regime, which is used in similar service and condition or other methods. 
The test conditions applicable for bogies running on standard gauge track under normal conditions of speed and track quality are defined in Annex J. They represent only the common part of the full range of tests to be performed on all types of bogie frames. 
It is not possible to specify tests of a general nature for each specific bogie component, in particular for the axle bearings, the connection between bogie and body, the dampers and the brakes. Such tests shall be drawn up case by case, using the tests defined above as a guide. The objectives and the parameter definitions of the tests already specified are detailed below. 
This remark also applies to the case of bogie frames intended for service on track with a different gauge, or under clearly different operating conditions, or bogies with a novel design. 
The three tests described in Annex J Sections J1, J2 and J3 have been defined in order to: 
- optimise the construction of the bogie frame (weight, speed) 
- supplement the information obtained from calculations 
- ensure that the bogie frames are suitable for withstanding the in-service loads without the occurrence of permanent deformation or cracks that would reduce safety or result in high maintenance costs. 
If there is no comparable solution available, experience has shown that three tests are required: two static tests (Annex J sections J1 and J2), and one dynamic test (Annex J section J3). 
The two static tests shall be performed first; they allow, in particular, for any bogies that do not meet the minimum strength requirements to be rejected. 
The dynamic test (fatigue test) is designed to verify whether the bogie design is sound, and whether fatigue cracks might be expected to occur in service. 
The load values that have been used for the definition of the tests have been derived in particular from running tests. 
The tests in Annex J section J1 are considered to represent the maximum loads that can occur in service, without taking the loads due to accidents into account. 
The tests in Annex J sections J2 and J3 are considered to represent, on average, the aggregate total of variable loads occurring during the bogie service life. 
The number of cycles in the fatigue test was selected to simulate an overall service life of 30 years at a rate of 100000 km per year. If this is not representative of the intended life cycle, the load cases shall be revised. 
The distribution of these cycles over three distinct load stages was done with a view to optimising bogie frame structures. In particular, the possibility of the occurrence of cracks during the last load stage provides a means to identify the most highly stressed zones, to which special attention shall be paid during manufacture, production testing and maintenance operations. 
To ensure the validity of the tests defined in Annex J sections J1, J2 and J3, particular attention shall be paid to their practical implementation. In particular: - 
For the static tests of Annex J sections J1 and J2, the bogie frames shall be equipped with uni-directional strain gauges in those locations where stresses occur with a single clearly defined direction; in all other locations tri-directional strain gauges (rosettes) shall be used. 
The active part of these gauges shall not exceed 10 mm. 
Strain gauges and strain rosettes are attached to the bogie frame at all highly stressed points, in particular in zones of stress concentration. 
The test set-up shall be defined so as to reproduce the forces acting on the bogie frame, and its deformation, as they occur in service. Particular attention shall be paid to the transmission of the vertical and transverse loads that in certain cases are distributed over several elements (e.g. pivot, springs, stops...). 
The static tests shall be performed on a complete bogie, equipped with its suspension. In most cases, this arrangement is not feasible for the fatigue test for practical reasons; a separate study shall be conducted to define the test set-up. 
The bogie frames used for the three tests shall be complete, and equipped with all their connecting elements (for dampers, brakes, etc.). They shall conform fully to the production drawings, and they shall have been manufactured under the same conditions as series-produced bogie frames. 
If cracks or fractures occur during the fatigue test, originating from manufacturing defects that were not detected during the preceding static testing of the bogie frame, the test shall be repeated with another frame. If the defects are confirmed, the design shall be considered as unsatisfactory.

Notes on Table above: 
N1. The timings shall be obtained from an emergency application on a single vehicle. Following inshot to approximately 10 % of the final brake cylinder pressure, the increase in pressure shall be progressive. The filling time begins when air commences to fill the cylinder and ends when the pressure reaches 95 % of the final value, and shall be as stated. 
N2. At the time of full and continuous release of the brake on a separate vehicle following an emergency application, the pressure in the brake cylinder shall fall progressively. The release time, measured from when air commences to be exhausted from the cylinder, to when the pressure reaches 0,4 bar shall be as stated. 
N3. In order to obtain maximum brake cylinder pressure, the brake pipe pressure shall be reduced by 1,4 to 1,6 bar below the regime pressure. 
N4. The maximum brake cylinder pressure obtained from a reduction in brake pipe pressure of 1,4 to 1,6 bar shall be 3,7 to 3,9 bar. 
N5. The sensitivity of the brake to decreases in brake pipe pressure shall be such that the brake is activated within 1,2 seconds if the normal working pressure drops by 0,6 bar in 6 seconds. 
N6. After charging the brake pipe to 5 bar, isolate the brake pipe, allow time for settlement and then ensure leakage does not exceed that stated. 
N7. After an emergency braking, with a brake pipe pressure of 0 bar, start measuring after the stabilisation period and ensure overall leakage does not exceed that stated. 
N8. The brake shall have a device enabling manual brake release. 
N9. For one value of brake pipe pressure, the brake cylinder pressure shall not vary by more than 0,1 bar during application and release. (For braking via pneumatically controlled relay valves for braking power variation, the 0,1 bar value applies to the pilot pressure.) 
N10. In the case of brakes with relay valves for the variation of the braking power, the pressure of 0,3 bar corresponds to the pressure existing at the pneumatic relay control (pilot reservoir). 
N11. Wagons where the automatic air brake application/release state cannot be checked without going underneath the wagon (for example those fitted with axle mounted disc brakes) shall be fitted with an indicator showing the state of the automatic brake. 
N12. Correct slack adjuster operation shall be confirmed by creating an excessive brake friction pair gap, demonstrating that repeated application/release cycles restore the correct clearance. 
N13. On the first of a series of wagons, the brake pad or block application force shall be measured to confirm that it complies with the design. 
N14. Brake rigging shall be free such that the pads/blocks clear the brake discs/wheels in the released state, and application forces are not reduced below design. 
N15. Parking brake components, rigging, leadscrews %amp% nuts etc, shall be free moving and lubricated if required by the design. 
N16. On the first of a series of wagons, the vehicle retarding force shall be measured resulting from a 500N input force at the end of a parking brake lever, or applied tangentially to a handwheel rim. The force measured shall comply with the design.

In the case of this TSI it shall be implemented in close co-ordination with the Noise TSI. 
7.2. TSI REVISION 
In conformity with article 6(3) of Directive 2001/16/EC as modified by Directive 2004/50/EC, the Agency shall be responsible for preparing the review and updating of TSIs and making appropriate recommendations to the Committee referred to in Article 21 of this directive in order to take account of developments in technology or social requirements. In addition, the progressive adoption and revision of other TSIs may also impact this TSI. Proposed changes to this TSI shall be subject to rigorous review and updated TSIs will be published on an indicative periodic basis of 3 years. 
The Agency shall be notified of any innovative solutions under consideration in order to determine its future inclusion within the TSI.

- the provisions of section 4.2.4.1.2.2 (Braking Performance elements) deceleration profile in braking power, for which a date of implementation will be given in future revisions of the TSI. 
This TSI does not apply to wagons being subject to a contract already signed or under final phase of tendering procedure before the date of entry into force of this TSI. 
7.4. EXISTING ROLLING STOCK 
7.4.1. APPLICATION OF THIS TSI TO EXISTING ROLLING STOCK 
Existing freight wagons are freight wagons that are already in service before this TSI enters into force. 
The TSI does not apply to existing rolling stock as long as it is not renewed or upgraded. 
7.4.2. UPGRADING AND RENEWAL OF EXISTING FREIGHT WAGONS 
Upgraded or renewed freight wagons requiring new authorisation for placing into service within the meaning of Directive 2001/16/EC Article 14.3, shall comply with: 
- sections 4.2, 5.3, 6.1.1 and 6.2 and any specific provisions in paragraph 7.7 below, as soon as this TSI comes into force and 
The following exceptions shall apply: 
- 4.2.3.3.2 Hot axle box detection (To be specified at the next revision of this TSI); 
- 4.2.4.1.2.2 Deceleration profile in braking power;

For these exceptions, national rules apply. 
With regards to wagons operating under the agreements specified in 7.5 below, the conditions to be applied when renewing or upgrading these wagons are those mentioned in the relevant agreements, if any. In the absence of such conditions, this TSI is applicable. 
7.4.3. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR WAGON MARKING 
In addition to the general case above for upgraded or renewed freight wagons, all existing interoperable freight wagons are required to comply with the requirements of this TSI with respect to the design of wagon markings from the date of the next overall repainting of the wagon without the intervention of a notified body. A Member State is permitted to define an earlier date of compliance. 
7.5. WAGONS OPERATING UNDER NATIONAL, BILATERAL, MULTILATERAL OR INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS 
7.5.1. EXISTING AGREEMENTS 
Member States shall notify the Commission, within 6 months after the entry into force of this TSI, of the following agreements under which freight wagons related to the scope of this TSI (construction, renewal, upgrading, placing in service, operation and management of wagons as defined in chapter 2 of this TSI) are operated: 
- National, bilateral or multilateral agreements between Member States and Railway Undertakings or Infrastructure Managers, agreed on either a permanent or temporary basis, and required due to the very specific or local nature of the intended transport service; 
- bilateral or multilateral agreements between Railway Undertakings, Infrastructure Managers or between Safety Authorities, which deliver significant levels of local or regional interoperability; 
- international agreements between one or more Member States and at least one third country, or between Railway Undertakings or Infrastructure Managers of Member States and at least one Railway Undertaking or Infrastructure Manager of a third country, which deliver significant levels of local or regional interoperability. 
Continued operation/maintenance of wagons covered by these agreements shall be permitted as far as they do comply with Community legislation. 
The compatibility of these agreements with EU legislation including their non-discriminatory character and, in particular, this TSI, will be assessed and the Commission will take the necessary measures such as, for example, the revision of this TSI to include possible specific cases or transitional measures. 
The RIV Agreement and COTIF instruments shall not be notified. 
7.5.2. FUTURE AGREEMENTS 
Any future agreement or modification of existing agreements shall take into account EU legislation and, in particular, this TSI. Member States shall notify the Commission with such agreements/modifications. The same procedure of § 7.5.1 then applies. 
7.6. PLACING IN SERVICE OF WAGONS 
In accordance with Article 16(1) of Directive 2001/16/EC, where compliance with the TSIs has been achieved and an EC Declaration of Verification is granted within one Member State for freight wagons, this shall be mutually recognised by all Member States. 
When seeking safety certification under article 10 of directive 2004/49 (Part B of the certificate) or authorisation of placing in service under article 14(1) of directive 2001/16, Railway Undertakings may seek certification/authorisation of placing in service for grouped wagons. Wagons may be grouped according to series or type. 
Once safety certification or authorisation of placing in service is granted for grouped wagons in one Member State, this shall be mutually recognised by all Member States in order to avoid duplication of safety/interoperability checks by Safety Authorities. 
As far as this TSI contains Open Points, authorisation for putting into service will be mutually accepted, except as indicated in Annex JJ. 
However, it must be verified that the wagons are operated on compatible infrastructures; this may be done through the use of Infrastructure and Rolling Stock registers.

Case "P" 
- Distributors 
Interoperability wagons for 1435 mm to operate on 1520 mm network shall be equipped with additional braking systems in accordance with the following: 
Option 1: fit two distributors with a changeover device 
- for the 1435 mm gauge: distributor according to Annex I 
- for the 1520 mm gauge: type 483 distributor 
Option 2: fit a standard distributor or an approved KE/483 distributor combination on the wagon that meets the technical braking requirements of both 1435 mm and 1520 mm gauge railways, with a changeover device allowing the system to switch to the respective operating regime. 
Under option 1, the wagon's brake equipment must include "brake on/off" and "freight/passenger" changeover devices as well as an "empty/loaded" device it there is no automatic load-proportional braking facility According to Annex I and a "brake on/off" and "empty — partly loaded — loaded" device as per the standards for the 1520 mm gauge and the "Technical Requirements for the Brake Equipment of Wagons built in RF Workshops". 
Each distributor must have its own release valve with a pull chord with handles on both sides of the wagon. 
For braking option 2, a distributor should preferably be used in combination with an automatic load-proportional braking system. When the braking position is switched over manually in accordance with the load, there must be at least two graduated positions for the braking force. 
- Load-proportional braking, brake power and brake performance 
The wagon's brakes must ensure that the prescribed values for the braked weight and the theoretical brake farce coefficients are guaranteed for operation on both 1435 mm and 1520 mm gauges at the respective maximum speeds. 
For operation on the 1435 mm gauge, wagons shall be fitted with either a hand-operated load-changeover device or an automatic load-proportional braking system meeting the requirements according to Annex I. 
For operation on the 1520 mm gauge, wagons shall be fitted with either an automatic load-proportional braking system or a hand-operated load-changeover device with at least two positions. Use of the automatic system and its configuration for the 1520 mm track gauge shall give due consideration to the bogie design used and the type of transition from one gauge to the other. 
Brake performance shall be calculated on the basis of the "Standard Braking Calculation for Freight and Refrigerator Wagons". Here, the theoretical coefficient calculated for the wagon brake block force when the brake system is switched on to the 1520 mm gauge shall satisfy the following values: 
- for K (composite) brake blocks: at least 0,14 up to a maximum of 0,31 for a fully-laden wagon and at least 0,22 up to a maximum of 0,37 for an empty wagon; 
- for GG (cast-iron) brake blocks: at least 0,36 up to a maximum of 0,70 for a fully-laden wagon and at least 0,62 up to a maximum of 0,81 for an empty wagon. 
The different wagon braking forces specified in the standards for operation on 1435 mm and 1520 mm track gauges can be accommodated by an appropriate adjustment to the brake rigging or the brake cylinder. 
- Changeover device for switching from 1435 to 1520 mm track gauges 
The changeover from one distributor system to another shall take place during the gauge changeover operation using the 1435 mm/1520 mm changeover device. Actuation of this device must require minimum effort and must jack reliably into its final position. The final position selected must correspond to one braking system only and must render the second braking system non-operational. When one braking system fails, the other must remain operational, assuming the wagon has two separate distributors. 
The switch from one braking system to another may only be effected in the gauge changeover station either manually (by means of a special device) or automatically. 
The braking system selected must be clearly indicated, even when the changeover takes place automatically. 
Where the changeover takes place automatically, an automatic load-proportional braking system should preferably be used.

C.2.2. Definitions 
C.2.2.1. Normal co-ordinates 
The expression "normal co-ordinates" is used for orthogonal axes defined in a plane normal to the centreline of the track in nominal position; one of these axes, sometimes called horizontal, is the intersection of the specified plane and the running surface; the other is the perpendicular to this intersection at equal distance from the rails. 
For calculation purposes, this centreline and the vehicle centreline must be considered as coincident in order to be able to compare the vehicle construction gauges and the lineside structure limit gauges, both calculated on the basis of the kinematic gauge reference profile which is common to both. 
Fig. C1 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
C.2.2.2. Reference profile 
Profile related to the normal co-ordinates, always accompanied by associated rules used, for rolling stock, to define the vehicle maximum construction gauge. 
C.2.2.3. Geometric overthrow 
The expression geometric overthrow means, for an element of a vehicle located on a radius R curve, the difference between the distance from this element to the track centreline and that which would exist on straight track, the axles being, in both cases, placed in a median position on the track, the play also being evenly distributed, the vehicle symmetrical and not tilted on its suspensions; in other words, it is that part of the vehicle element offset which is due to the track curvature. 
On the same side of the track centreline, all the points in the same vehicle body cross-section have the same geometric overthrow. 
Fig.C2 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
C.2.2.4. Roll centre C 
When the vehicle body is subjected to a lateral force parallel to the running surface (gravity component, see figure 3a, or centrifugal force, see figure 3b) it tilts on its suspensions. 
If the vehicle lateral play and the effect on its dampers have reached their limits in this condition, the XX' centreline of a lateral section takes up a X1X'1 position. 
In routine cases of vehicle lateral movements, the position of point C is independent of the lateral force involved. Point C is known as the roll centre of the vehicle and its distance hc from the running surface is known as the height of the roll centre. 
The value hc can be measured or calculated. In the case of extreme vehicle/bogie positions for calculating the maximum construction gauge, this height hc must be taken at one of the vehicle body/bogie bump stops concerned (centre or rotational stops); in the case where it can be neither measured nor calculated, hc should be taken as equal to 0,5 m. 
Fig.C3 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
C.2.2.5. Asymmetry 
The asymmetry of a vehicle is defined as the angle ηo that would be formed between the vertical and the centreline of the body of a stationary vehicle on level track in the absence of friction (see Figure 3c). 
Asymmetry may result from constructional defects, unevenly adjusted suspension (scotching, side-bearers, pneumatic levelling valves, etc.) and from an off-centre load. 
2.2.6. Coefficient of flexibility s (see Fig. C3) 
Whenever a stationary vehicle is placed on a canted track whose running surface lies at an angle δ to the horizontal, its body leans on its suspensions and forms an angle η with the perpendicular to the rail level. The vehicle flexibility coefficient s is defined by the ratio: 
This ratio may be calculated or measured (see UIC Leaflet 505-5). It depends in particular on the load state of the vehicle. 
Powered units of constant weight: Locomotives, etc: Unladen state in running order 
Vehicles with non-constant weight: Multiple units, coaches, vans, coaches with driving cab, etc. 
Unladen state in running order and exceptional load state (maximum load state) 
Vehicles with non-constant weight: Wagons: Unladen state in running order and maximum load state 
C.2.2.6. Maximum construction gauge for rolling stock 
The maximum construction gauge is the maximum profile, obtained by applying the rules giving reductions in relation to the reference profile, which the various parts of the rolling stock must respect. These reductions depend on the geometric characteristics of the rolling stock in question, the position of the cross-section in relation to the bogie pivot or to the axles, the height of the point considered in relation to the running surface, constructional play, the maximum wear allowance and the elastic characteristics of the suspension. 
In general, the effective construction gauge uses only partially the non-hatched areas within the maximum construction gauge for the installation of foot-steps, hand-rails, etc. 
Fig. C4 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
C.2.2.7. Kinematic gauge 
This covers the furthest positions in relation to the centres of the normal co-ordinates likely to be taken by various parts of rolling stock, taking into account the most unfavourable positions of the axles on the track, the lateral play and quasi-static movements attributable to the rolling stock and to the track. 
The kinematic gauge does not take account of certain random factors (oscillations, asymmetry, if ηo ≤ 1o): the suspended parts of the vehicles may therefore exceed the kinematic gauge in the course of oscillation. Such movements are taken into account by the Way and Works Department. 
C.2.2.8. Quasi-static movements z 
"z" is the part of lateral movements attributable to the rolling stock (when there is a 50 mm cant deficiency) and resulting from the technology and flexibility of the suspensions (flexibility coefficient s), under the effect of centrifugal force not compensated for by cant or of excessive cant (see Figure 3a or 3b) and under the effect of asymmetry ηo (see Figure 3c). This value depends on the height h of the point in question. 
C.2.2.9. S projections (Fig.C5) 
Part outside the reference profile when the vehicle is on a curve and/or on track with a gauge wider than 1,435 m.s 
The half-width of the vehicle, plus the D movements, minus the half-width of the reference profile at the same level, is equivalent to the actual projection S in relation to the reference profile. 
Also see Section 2.3"Permitted projections". 
C.2.2.10. Ei or Ea reductions 
To ensure that a vehicle when on the track does not exceed the "vehicle limit position" in view of its D movements, the half-width dimensions must be subject to an Ei or Ea reduction, in relation to the reference profile, such that: 
Ei or Ea ≥ D — So. 
The following distinction is made: 
— Ei : reduction value for the reference profile half-width dimensions for the sections located between the end axles of vehicles not mounted on bogies or between the pivots of vehicles mounted on bogies 
— Ea : reduction value for the reference profile half-width dimensions for the sections beyond the end axles of vehicles not mounted on bogies or the pivots of vehicles mounted on bogies. 
C.2.2.11. Lineside structure gauge 
Profile in relation to the axes of co-ordinates normal to the track, inside which no structure must penetrate despite elastic or non-elastic track movements. 
C.2.3. General comments on the method for obtaining the maximum rolling stock construction gauge 
The study of the maximum construction gauge takes into account both the lateral and vertical movements of the rolling stock, drawn up on the basis of the geometrical and suspension characteristics of the vehicle under various loading conditions. 
In general, the maximum construction gauge of a vehicle is determined for the ni or na values which correspond to the middle of the vehicle and the headstocks. It is of course necessary to check all the projecting points, as well as those which, in view of their location, are likely to be in close proximity to the vehicle construction maximum gauge within the section under consideration. 
Transversally, taking into account the vehicle body movements obtained for a point located on an ni or na section at height h in relation to the running surface, the half-widths of the maximum vehicle construction gauge shall be at the most equal to the corresponding half-widths of the reference profile, specific to each type of vehicle, decreased by the Ei or Ea reductions. 
These reductions must satisfy the relationship Ei or Ea ≥ D — So in which: 
- D represents the movements whose values are calculated by the formulae given in Para. 1.4.2. 
- So represents the maximum projections, the values of which are shown in Para. 2.3 "Permitted projections". 
C.2.3.1. Relative positions of the various gauges 
Fig.C5 shows the position of the various gauges in relation to each other, as well as the main elements involved in determining the rolling stock maximum construction gauge. 
Fig. C5 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
C.2.4. Rules for the reference profile for determining the maximum rolling stock construction gauge 
In order to determine the maximum construction gauge of a vehicle, the Rules for the reference profiles must take account of: 
- vertical movements, 
- transverse movements. 
Construction tolerances are partly taken into account in the asymmetry calculation. 
The nominal width value of a vehicle is obtained from the dimensions of the maximum constructional profile. 
Tolerance values must not be used systematically to increase vehicle dimensions. 
C.2.4.1. Vertical movements 
For the vehicle or for a given part, these movements make it possible to determine a minimum height and a maximum height above the running surface; this is particularly the case for: 
- parts located towards the lower section of the gauge (low parts); 
- the step at 1170 mm from the running surface on the reference profile; 
- parts located at the upper part of the vehicles. 
It should be noted that for all parts located at a height greater than 400 mm above the running surface, the vertical component of the quasi-static movements is not taken into account. 
C.2.4.1.1. Determination of minimum heights above the running surface 
The minimum heights above the running surface for parts located towards the lower part of the gauge (1170 mm and below) are determined with account being taken of the vertical movements described in the following paragraphs. 
When studying the sag of the vehicle bodies (also see Appendix 2) the division shown in the diagram below shall be considered. 
Fig. C6 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
Sags independent of the load state and of the suspension state 
These deflections shall be considered for all vehicle body zones A, B, C and D, and concern the following parts: 
— Wheels : maximum wear for all types of vehicles 
— Various parts : maximum wear — Examples: side-bearers, brake rigging, etc, for all vehicles and for each special assembly 
— Axle boxes : wear ignored 
— Bogie frame : manufacturing tolerances giving rise to deflection in relation to the nominal dimensions: ignored 
— Body structures : manufacturing tolerances giving rise to deflection in relation to the nominal dimensions: ignored for all vehicles including all conventional and special wagons. 
Deflection dependent on the load state of the vehicles and on the state of their suspension 
1 — Structural distortions: sags for all the vehicle body zones A, B, C, and D. 
Axles | Deflection ignored | | 
Bogie frame | Deflection ignored | | 
Body | Transverse deflection | ignored | 
| Twist | ignored | 
| Longitudinal deflection | ignored for all vehicles, except wagons for which the longitudinal sag must be taken into account under the effect of a maximum load increased by 30 % to take dynamic stresses into consideration. | 
2 — Deflection of the suspensions 
Types of springs: 
The primary and secondary suspensions are formed of various types of springs for which the deflections must be taken into account: 
Steel spring | Deflection under static load, Additional deflection under dynamic stress, Deflection due to flexibility tolerances. | 
Rubber spring | Same deflections as for steel springs | 
Pneumatic spring | Total deflection with cushions deflated (including back-up suspension when it exists) | 
- Suspension deflection conditions 
- Equal and simultaneous deflections on the suspensions (zones A, B, C and D are concerned). 
- "Conventional" wagons: total deflection (bottoming). 
- Special wagons: deflection under the effect of a 30 % overload on the sprung weight (in order to make maximum use of the gauge, especially in the case of combined transport or of bulky loads) or total deflection (bottoming). 
- Other deflections see Appendix 3. 
C.2.4.1.2. Passing over vertical transition curves (including marshalling yard humps) and over braking, shunting or stopping devices. 
a) Vehicles with a reference profile (part below 130 mm) in accordance with paragraph C.3.2.3 
Normal values for the ei or ea vertical reductions to be taken into account for empty coaches, empty or loaded vans and wagons. 
These vehicles, when they can be gravity shunted, must be capable of passing over activated rail brakes and other shunting or stopping devices located on non-vertically curved track and reaching the 115 and 125 mm dimensions above the running surface, up to 3 m from the end of convex transition curves of radius Rv ≥ 250 m (dimension d). 
They must also be able to pass over such devices located inside or near concave transitions curves of radius Rv ≥ 300 m. 
In applying these conditions, the lower dimensions of these vehicles, taking into account vertical movements, assessed as stated in paragraph § 1.4.1, must in relation to the running surface be at least equal to 115 or 125 mm increased by the following ei or ea quantities: 
Fig.C7 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
ei or ea : vertical reduction at the lower part of the rolling stock equipment in relation to the 115 or 125 mm dimensions. 
ev : lowering of the rail brakes in relation to the 115 or 125 mm dimensions. 
For sections between the end axles or bogie pivots (normal values expressed in metres) The purpose of the numerical index applied to the ei and E'i values is to distinguish the normal values from the reduced values: 
ei1=na.a-n-32500 when a≤17,80 m and n%lt%a-3n 
ei1=a-333375awh when a≤17,80 m and n≥a-33 [1] 
ei1=274.na-31-na-32a23375-0,04 when a%gt%17,80 m and n%lt%a-33 
ei1=a23375-0,04 when a%gt%17,80 m and n≥a-33 [1] 
When empty coaches and empty or loaded wagons and vans can be gravity shunted, they must also be able to pass over convex transition curves of radius ≥ 250 m, without any part other than the wheel flange descending below the running surface. 
This condition, which concerns the central part of the vehicles, is in addition to those resulting from the ei formulae for long vehicles. 
Fig. C8

For sections located beyond the end axles or bogie pivots (values in metres)

Reduced values for the ei increase (sections between the end axles or bogie pivots) to be considered for certain vehicles for passing over gradient transition curves including shunting humps. 
These reduced values are only tolerated for certain types of wagon, insofar as they require a larger space than that determined using the normal values. These are, for example, the recess wagons used in rail/road combined traffic, and other identical or similar designs. 
Use of these reduced values may require special precautions to be taken in certain marshalling yards with hump retarders at the base of a shunting gradient. 
For these vehicles, the value of dimension d becomes 5 m.

When they can be gravity shunted, the wagons must also be able to pass over convex transition curves with a radius greater than or equal to 250 m, without any part other than the wheel flange descending below the running surface. 
This condition, which concerns the central part of the wagons, is in addition to those resulting from the ei formulae for long wagons.

b) Vehicles not allowed on shunting humps by reason of their length 
Empty coaches, wagons suitable for international traffic and empty or loaded vans that are not allowed over marshalling yard humps on account of their length, must nonetheless respect the profile in paragraph C.3.2.3 when placed on a non-vertically curved track, so as to allow for the use of shunting or stopping devices. 
c) All vehicles 
All vehicles must be able to pass over convex or concave transition curves of radius Rv ≥ 500 m, without any part other than the wheel flange descending below the running surface. 
This may concern mainline vehicles whose: 
- wheelbase is greater than 17,8 m, 
- overhang is greater than 3,4 m. 
d) Special cases 
Account must be taken of the following particular cases: 
- Vertical transition curves for vehicles fitted with the automatic coupler. 
- Angle of inclination for vehicles used on ferries. 
C.2.4.1.3. Determination of maximum heights above the running surface 
The value of vertical movements to be taken into consideration, as regards the upper parts of rolling stock where h ≥ 3250 mm, is determined with account being taken of the upward dynamic movements for empty rolling stock in running order without wear. 
In this part, the vehicles come close to the reference profile under the influence of: 
1) upward oscillations, 
2) the vertical component of the quasi-static inclination, 
3) transverse movements. 
Consequently, the vertical dimensions of the reference profile must be reduced by the values generated by these movements ξ, if they can be calculated, or otherwise by a fixed value of 15 mm per suspension stage. 
Nevertheless, it must be noted that when the vehicle is subject to quasi-static inclination, the side opposite the inclination rises but at the same time moves away from the reference profile in such a way that no interference is to be feared. Conversely, on the side of the inclination, the vehicle lowers, thus compensating part of the upward movements. 
As an approximation, for cant excess or deficiency of 50 mm, this vertical reduction ΔV(h) of the reference profile for nominal heights greater than h=3,25 m is expressed as: 
where: 
12LCR(h) represents the half-width of the reference profile, 
Ei or Ea the transverse reductions, 
s the vehiclE's coefficient of flexibility, 
ξ the vehicle resilience (fixed or calculated term). 
Example: for a vehicle with a reduction Ei or Ea of 217 mm based on h = 3,25 m, we obtain: 
Reductions for cut-away sides on the upper part of the reference profile. 
Fig. C12 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
C.2.4.2. Lateral movements (D) 
These movements are the sum of the following movements: 
- geometric movements resulting from the vehicle running through curves and straight track (projections, lateral play, etc.), where the vehicle centreline is considered to be perpendicular to the running surface; 
- quasi-static movements resulting from the inclination of the suspended parts under the influence of gravity (canted track) and/or centrifugal acceleration (curved track). 
- lateral sag of the vehicle body is generally disregarded except for those special types of wagon or heavily-laden wagons for which these values are particularly high. 
C.2.4.2.1. Vehicle running position on the track and displacement factor (A) 
The various vehicle running positions on the track depend on the transverse play of the various parts connecting the vehicle body to the track and on the configuration of the running gear (independent axles, powered bogies, trailer bogies, etc). 
It is therefore necessary to consider the various positions which the vehicle may take up on the track so as to take into account any displacement factor A to be applied to certain terms in the fundamental formulae used for calculating the Ei internal and Ea external reductions. 
The displacement factor and the vehicle running position on the track are given in the table below. For the cases of axle configuration not represented in the table, the running position conditions to be taken into account must be the least favourable. 
For articulated vehicles, it is recommended to take the running position for conventional 2-bogie vehicles.

If 0 %lt% μ %lt% 0,2 | the bogie is considered | "trailer" | 
If μ = 0 | the bogie is | "trailer". | 
C.2.4.2.3. Quasi-static movement (z) 
These movements are taken into account when calculating Ei or Ea, depending on the flexibility coefficient s, the height h above the running surface of the point under consideration and the height of the roll centre hc. 
The Way and Works Department shall define the lineside clearance gauge for h %gt% 0,5 m, when the effective cant excess or deficiency of the track is greater than 0,05 m calculating in conventional manner the extra quasi-static inclination for rolling stock with a coefficient of flexibility of 0,4 and a roll centre height of 0,5 m. 
The Rolling Stock Department shall determine Ei and Ea taking into account: 
- a cant excess or deficiency of 0,05 m; 
- where appropriate a cant excess or deficiency of 0,2 m, when the respective values of s and hc lead to the gauge defined by the Way and Works Department being exceeded (see figure below and paragraph 1.5.1.3). 
- of the influence, beyond 1o, of the asymmetry resulting from design and adjustment (1) tolerances (side-bearers play) and from any unevenness in the distribution of the normal load. The influence of asymmetry less than 1o is taken into account in the lineside clearance gauge, as are the lateral oscillations created randomly by causes inherent both to the rolling stock and track (for resonance phenomena in particular).

C.2.5. Determination of reductions by calculation 
Reductions Ei and Ea are determined on the basis of the following fundamental relation: 
Reduction Ei or Ea = Movement Di or Da — Projection So 
Internal reductions 
and external reductions 
In these formulae: 
- A, displacement factor, describes the position of the axles on the track. Values for A are given in paragraph (see section C.2.4.2.1). 
- Di or Da is the sum of the movements defined in the following paragraph. 
- So is the maximum projection. 
xi and xa are special terms for the calculation for vehicles with very large wheelbase. 
C.2.5.1. Terms taken into account in calculating movements (D) 
In view of the particular features of each type of vehicle, additional terms are necessary and some parameters may alter the following terms: 
C.2.5.1.1. Terms concerning the running position of the vehicle on a curve (geometric overthrow) 
12Rani-ni2+p24= Geometric overthrow of a given section towards the inside of a curve of radius R (problem of vehicle body sections located on inside of bogie pivots or of axles). 
12Rana+na2-p24= Geometric overthrow of a given section towards the outside of a curve of radius R (problem of vehicle body sections located on outside of bogie pivots or of axles) 
Note: for special vehicles with particular bogie configurations, these formulae may need to be adapted. 
C.2.5.1.2. Group of terms concerning lateral play 
The value of all these plays is measured at right angles to the axles or pivots, with all parts at wear limit. 
The vehicle running positions on the track, as shown in paragraph 7.2.2, enable the play to be taken into account in the formulae and the value of the displacement coefficient applicable to be determined, in order to calculate their effect on the section considered. 
1,465-d2= play of the axle in the track 
q = play between axles and underframe and/or between axle and vehicle body. In other words, the lateral movement between axle-boxes and journals, plus that between the underframe and axle-boxes from the central position and on each side. 
w = play of bogie pivots or bolsters. This is the possible lateral movement of the bogie pivots or bolsters, from the central position and on each side, or, for vehicles without a pivot, the possible lateral movement of the vehicle body in relation to the bogie frame, from the central position and depending on the curve radius and the direction of movement. 
If the value of w varies with the curve radius: 
- wi(R) means that w is considered for radius R and the inside of the curve; 
- wa(R) means that w is considered for radius R and the outside of the curve; 
- w∞ means that w is considered for straight track. 
According to the specific features of each type of vehicle, this term may be rotated: w', wi, w'i, etc. It can also be equal to the sum of some of these notations: wi + wa, etc, each of these terms being potentially influenced by the corresponding displacement factor. 
C.2.5.1.3. Quasi-static movements (term concerning vehicle['s] inclination [leaning] on its suspension and its asymmetry when this is greater than 1o) 
Paragraph C.2.4.2.3. "Quasi-static movements" gives a chart showing the different parts making up the term z 
z = deviation from the track central position. This deviation is equal to the sum of 2 terms : 
- s30h-hc: term concerning the inclination due to the suspension (lateral movement due to the flexibility of the suspension, under the influence of cant excess or deficiency of 0,05 m); 
tanη0-1oh-hc: term concerning the asymmetry, (lateral movement due to that part of the asymmetry exceeding 1) 
This sum may be increased by: 
s10h-hc-0,04h-0,5%gt%0%gt%0: term integrating cant excess or deficiency of 0,2 m and applicable under the conditions defined in paragraph 1.4.2.3. 
For sprung parts located at height h, the above terms give, in the formulae, a value of: 
a) Special cases 
when | { | h%gt%hc and 0,5ms≤0,4η0≤1o | } | z=s30h-hc | 
when | { | h%lt%0,5 mη0≤1oand for any value of hc and s | } | z=4s30hc-h | 
when h = hc | | | | z = 0 | 
For unsprung parts z = 0. 
b) Influence of side-bearers play for wagons fitted with bogies 
- For wagons fitted with bogies whose side-bearers play is less than or equal to 5 mm, the 1o angle of asymmetry is considered to cover this play and the formula η0 = 1o is conventionally used. 
The term "z" taking into account side-bearers play less than or equal to 5 mm is given as: 
z=s30h-hc+s10h-hc-0,04h-0,5%gt%0%gt%0 
and account must be taken of the special cases described above. 
- For wagons fitted with bogies whose side-bearers play is greater than 5 mm, account should be taken of the additional inclination α of the vehicle body, expressed as follows: 
α=arctanJ-0,005bG 
This additional inclination α leads to compression of the suspension which, when multiplied by the coefficient of flexibility s, is given as a rotation of the vehicle body: αs (where s is the coefficient of flexibility). 
The total additional inclination may be expressed as: 
α (1 + s) 
The term z taking account of side-bearers play greater than 5 mm becomes: 
z=s30+tanη'0+arctan J-0,005%gt%0bG1+s-1o%gt%0h-hc+s10h-hc-0,04h-0,5%gt%0%gt%0 
Note: %gt%0 means that the expression between the square brackets should be taken as its own value if that value is positive or as 0 if that value is negative or null. 
η’0 = asymmetry in the case of 5 mm side-bearers play. 
c) Special terms xi and xa 
Terms representing the correction to be made to certain formulae used to calculate the reductions Ei and Ea for the parts distant from the pivots of vehicles with a very large wheelbase and/or very large overhang in order to limit space requirement in curves of radius between 250 m and 150 m: 
It will be noted that: 
- xi only enters the formulae if a2+p24%gt%100, i.e. an approximate value for a of 20 m; 
- xa only applies if ana+na2-p24%gt%120 (exceptional case) 
Special condition for xa: 
The term xa is not used in the calculation of reductions applicable to vehicles whose overhang respects the conditions laid down for the automatic coupler. 
C.3. GAUGE G1 
In 1991 the decision was taken that the regulations for static gauge should no longer be used for the construction of wagons. 
The static gauge regulations therefore remain applicable only to the gauges specially defined for loads, which was the case for example with gauges GA, GB, GB1,GB2 and GC. 
Static gauge regulations mentioned below include: 
1. a reference profile (upper sections), 
2. reduction formulae linked with this profile.

C.3.2.1. Part common to all vehicles 
Fig. C15 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
The G1 kinematic reference profile takes into account the most restrictive lineside structure positions and track centre distances in Continental Europe. 
It is divided into 2 parts as follows, one being above and the other below the 400 mm height that is also the limit for the calculation of projections: 
- an upper part defined as being above a plane located 400 mm above the running surface, common to all vehicles, 
- a lower part defined as being located at or below the plane located 400 mm above the running surface and which differs according to whether the vehicles must pass over shunting bumps, rail brakes and other activated shunting and stopping devices (part lower than 130 mm) or not. 
The part below 130 mm differs according to vehicle type. 
Loaded coaches must respect the provisions of paragraph C.3.2.2 when on a track without vertical curvature. 
Vans and wagons, whether empty or loaded, except for well-wagons and certain combined transport wagons, must satisfy paragraph C.3.2.3. 
In the case of wagons intended to run in transit on the Finnish network, the elements of the lower parts must respect the gauge in accordance with the specific standards. 
Wagons which must not pass over shunting humps with a curvature radius of 250 m or track brakes and other shunting and stopping devices: 
- shall not be allowed to carry the RIV sign, unless otherwise expressly specified in the standards 
- are required to bear the inscription to that effect. 
C.3.2.2. Part below 130 mm on vehicles which must not pass over shunting humps or negotiate rail brakes and other activated shunting and stopping devices 
Certain gauge restrictions must be observed at right angles to the axles when vehicles are placed on an under-floor wheel lathe for wheel reprofiling.

C.3.2.3.1. Use of shunting devices on curved track sections 
Rail brakes and other shunting and stopping devices which, when activated, can reach the dimensions 115 or 125 mm, in particular drag shoes 125 mm high, may be placed on curves of radius R ≥ 150 m.

It follows that the application limit for the 115 or 125 mm dimensions, which is at a constant distance from the inner edge of the rail (80 mm), is at a variable distance D from the centreline of the vehicle, as shown in figure 17 above. 
Take the following: (1) (values given in metres)

Coaches for which the play w varies non-linearly with the curvature 
On straight track the reductions are calculated using formulae 201 and 206. 
On curves, the reductions are calculated for R = 150 m and R = 250 m using formulae (204), (205), (209) and (210). 
It should be noted that for a radius of R = 250 m, formulae (204) and (209) are identical, respectively, to formulae (202) and (207). 
Furthermore, formulae (204), (205) and (209), (210) must be applied for values of R for which the variation of w, as a function of 1R, presents a discontinuity (a step change), i.e. the value of R from which the variable stops come into play. 
For each section of the coach, the reduction to be taken is the greatest of those resulting from the application of the above-mentioned formulae, in which the value of R to be used is that which gives the highest value for the part between square brackets.

On non electrified lines, the same possibilities are allowable subject to specific studies by the railways. 
C.3.6. Rules for the reference profile for determining the maximum rolling stock construction gauge 
C.3.6.1. Powered units fitted with pantographs 
Pantograph in current collection position 
The present standard is based on the characteristics of pantographs for standard gauge powered units. 
In order for powered units with pantographs to respect the limit position resulting from the reference profile, the characteristics of these vehicles (play and coefficient of flexibility of the pantograph-bearing section) and the position of the pantograph in relation to the axles must be such that the quantities E'i and E'a (with pantographs raised to 6,5 m above the running surface) and E"i and E"a (pantographs raised to 5 m above the running surface) are negative or nil. 
This condition is met if the section in which the pantograph bow is operated is placed close to the transverse centreline of the bogies, i.e. if n is very small or nil. 
The limit position is then defined by the reference profile for roof-mounted equipment shown in paragraph 2.5. It corresponds to a maximum geometric overthrow of the pantograph bow of 2,5R. 
a) Preliminary calculations 
To determine E'i, E'a, E"i and E"a, the following preliminary calculations are necessary [27] 1):

Subject, if necessary, to application of the insulation conditions, the lowered pantograph must fall entirely within the gauge defined.

On vehicles which may use a 25 kV power supply, all non-insulated parts likely to remain live must be arranged so as to fall well within the 0,170 m reference profile.

By comparison with the G1 gauge, the GA, GB and GC gauges are larger in the upper part.

Wagons and coaches built to gauges GA, GB or GC shall be identified by a marking as specified in Annex B 32 
C.4.1. Static gauge reference profiles and associated rules 
The reference profiles for the static gauges GA GB and GC (see Fig. 20), together with their associated rules, apply exclusively to determining the maximum load profiles and on the condition that the coefficient of flexibility of the wagon + its load is not greater than that of the typical load considered, having the following characteristics:

J = 0,005m η0 %lt% 1o hC = 0,5m 
s = 0,3

The term "clearly defined loads" shall be understood to mean: transferable unit loads of known geometry, e.g. containers and swap bodies conveyed on carrier wagons fitted with load positioning devices, and semi-trailers with deflated air suspension or mechanical suspension with a known roll flexibility coefficient and conveyed on recess wagons. 
Under these conditions the combination of a wagon and its load can be treated as a normal single wagon.

The Infrastructure Managers of the different countries are free to conclude bi- or multilateral agreements between themselves in order to permit the running over the whole or part of their respective lines, of vehicles other than those built to the G1, GA, GB or GC profiles. 
In order for such agreements to be made, it is sufficient to define a kinematic reference profile and associated rules.

C.5.3. Gauge 3.3 
C.5.3.1. General 
Kinematic gauge 3.3 can be used for services running on the French network (Réseau Ferré National — RFN). 
This gauge affords additional space towards the top compared with the G1 gauge. It is applicable to vehicles (for example, double-decker coaches) that run only on lines with gauge 3.3 clearances. 
Gauge 3.3 concerns only the top part of the reference profile, above 3,25 m, the bottom part being common to the G1 gauge. As any other gauge, it is associated with a reference profile and associated rules.

C.5.3.3. Rules for the reference profile to determine the maximum construction gauge 
The rules for the reference profile of the 3.3 gauge are identical to those for the G1 gauge, except for the following specific details: 
- Permitted projections So (S) 
- Quasi-static displacements z. 
C.5.3.3.1. Permitted projections So (S) 
- For the parts located higher than 3,500 m from the running surface, the value So of the projection to be taken into account as a function of the curve to calculate the reductions Ei and Ea is 37,5R irrespective of the type of vehicle. 
- Thus, the effective projections S must not exceed the following So values: 
- 0,15 m on 250 m radius curves 
- 0,15 m on 150 m radius curves. 
Moreover, on straight (tangent) track, So is set equal to 0,015 m. 
- For the parts located higher than 3,250 m lower than 3,500 m above the running surface, that is the parts between levels A and B of the reference profile, there are no rules for fixing the value of So of the maximum projection. The determination the maximum construction gauge between these two levels is done by joining the point of the maximum construction gauge corresponding to Level A, found by calculating the reductions from the projections according to the rules for the G1 gauge, to the point of the maximum construction gauge corresponding to Level B, found by calculating the reductions from the above-stated projections. 
- For the parts located less than 3,250 m above the running surface, the general rule for the G1 gauge should be applied.

For suspended components, located at a height h, the value of z is given by the formula:

C.5.4. Gauge GB-M6 
C.5.4.1. General 
The GB-M6 kinematic gauge can be used in services running on the Belgian (SNCB) network. 
The GB-M6 kinematic gauge is based on the same principles as the G1 gauge, it is adapted to the SNCB infrastructure and its reduction formulae are likewise adapted as concerns the verification radii and the projections permitted in curves. 
The permitted projections are more generous than those for the G1 gauge and therefore make it possible to run wider vehicles. 
Concerning the pantograph, in addition to the UIC 505-1 regulations allowing vehicles equipped with 1950 mm-wide pantographs to run, the SNCB infrastructure also accommodates 1760 mm-wide pantographs fitted on more flexible vehicles with characteristics as follows: s ≤ 0,4 and (q + w) ≤ 0,065 m. 
The bogies as well as their ancillary components fitted to vehicles built to this gauge strictly follow the rules for the G1 gauge. 
Suspended parts located at a level, or which might descend to a level, less than 100 mm above the running surface due to vertical displacements are calculated in accordance with the G1 rules. 
When, due to vertical movements, a point located near the 1170 mm level might rise above or drop below this level, it is necessary to consider the minimum permitted width, by using either the formulae governing the parts above 1170 mm, or the formulae governing the parts below or at the 1170 mm level. 
The choice between the reduction formulae for tractive units or for hauled units is made in the same way as for the G1 gauge, based on the coefficient of adhesion at start-up.

C.6.1.1. Conditions concerning doors, steps and footboards 
1. Carriage doors 
a) In opened position, carriage doors whose bottom-most part is at least 1050 mm above the rail-top, when the vehicle is in the lowest permissible position for the buffers, may project beyond the vehiclE's reduced clearance gauge by at most 200 mm. 
On vehicles built after 1.1.1986, the carriage doors must meet this requirement even during door opening. 
This requirement does not apply to hinged doors fitted to coaches prior to 1.1.1980. 
b) At shunting speeds up to about 30 km/h, lateral play generally does not exceed 0,02 m. 
For bodyside doors located beyond the bogie pivots and whose bottom edges are located less than 1050 mm above the rail-top, the necessary reduction of the gauge, in the lowest permissible, 980 mm buffer position, can be reduced 
- during opening and 
- in opened position 
by a maximum of wa-0,02n+aa 
This applies only if wa %gt% 0,02 m 
It shall be permitted to use doors that meet the requirements of both a) and b) above. In that case, the requirements under a) must be met also during door opening. 
2. Steps and footboards 
When the bottom step is retractable, the necessary reduction of the loading gauge for running with the step down may be cut back at most by the value:

C.8. Appendix 3 Rolling Stock Loading Gauge 
C.8.1. Calculation of the loading gauge of tilting vehicles 
C.8.1.1. General 
The acceptance into international service of rolling stock fitted with tilting body systems shall be subject to bilateral or multilateral agreements between the railways concerned. 
C.8.1.2. Scope 
This Appendix deals with the method of calculating the loading gauge of tilting body vehicles, hereinafter designated by the abbreviation TBV. 
Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 deal with the technical analysis of the calculation of the loading gauge of TBVs. 
Paragraph 5 comments on the conditions of tilting and the speed of TBVs. 
C.8.1.3. Field of application 
A TBV is defined as a vehicle in which the body can perform a rolling movement relative to the running gear when the vehicle goes round a curve, with the object of compensating for the centrifugal acceleration. 
The appearance and the introduction into international service of trainsets made up of vehicles fitted with tilting body systems required certain modifications to be made to the rules regarding the loading gauge calculations for conventional vehicles. 
This Appendix deals with the calculation rules for TBVs to obtain the maximum loading gauge for vehicle construction. 
C.8.1.4. Background 
The TBV concept began to be developed in the years 1970-80 in several European countries in order to run with higher speeds on existing lines without detriment to the comfort of the passengers. 
The speed in curves of railway vehicles is restricted because of the lateral acceleration which acts on the passengers: this limit of uncompensated acceleration is of the order of 1 to 1,3 ms-2. 
TBV units, in particular those fitted with active systems, can run with higher values of uncompensated acceleration (for example 1,82 ms-2 for the FIAT ETR 450 train, equivalent to a cant deficiency of 278 mm) because the tilting of the body enables the values of the lateral acceleration felt by the passengers to be reduced. 
C.8.1.5. Conditions related to safety 
The Builders of TBV units shall provide evidence that the vehicles meet the loading gauge under all the different cases of operation that are planned. 
In addition to the calculation of the loading gauge, the Builder shall supply a report on the criteria adopted and on the devices on which safety depends, that is devices that must "fail safe". 
Failure cases which might result in TBV units exceeding the reference profile shall be investigated by the Builder. Depending on the seriousness of their effects, special measures shall be taken by the Railways, that may concern railway operations, alarms, warnings to the driver, etc. 
The Builder shall also guarantee that the tilting system is so designed that the units cannot run with values of uncompensated acceleration higher than the values allowed for conventional vehicles if the tilting system fails. 
C.8.1.6. Symbols used 
The following additional symbols are used in this Appendix: 
IP = value of the cant deficiency considered for the TBV 
IC = value of the maximum cant deficiency permitted by the Permanent Way Department of the Railway [31] 1) 
E = value of the cant 
zP = quasi-static displacements determined according to the needs of the TBV units 
C.8.2. Basic conditions to determine the loading gauge of TBV units 
For the calculation of the loading gauge of TBV units, all the running conditions shall be examined both with the tilting system active and inactive. 
The worst cases shall be examined, in particular: 
SITUATION 1) case of a vehicle running in a curve with maximum cant deficiency (maximum body tilt); 
SITUATION 2) case of a vehicle stationary in a curve. When an active TBV is stopped on a curve its position does not differ from that of a conventional vehicle and, therefore, can be dealt with using the principles and formulae applicable to a conventional vehicle. 
Note also that for certain types of passive TBV units, such as the TALGO, there is no quasi-static inclination z due to the flexibility, i.e. s = 0. 
C.8.2.1. Types of body tilting systems 
In spite of the above, the different tilting system designs can be grouped according to the method of tilt of the bodies. This tilt can be obtained either with a natural or an equivalent tilting movement (passive tilt) when the centre of rotation of the body is above the position of the bodies' centre of gravity, as in the TALGO system, or by jacks which tilt the body depending on the radius of curvature and the speed (by an active tilting movement as in the FIAT system). 
Let us examine the inclination of the body allowed by the different body tilting systems: 
In the case of TBVs fitted with ACTIVE systems, the bodies are subjected to a quasi-static tilt caused by the uncompensated acceleration: This is not, however, the same as the body tilt imparted separately by the system. Figure 1a shows the principle of the inclination of a vehicle with an active tilt system. 
Fig. C30 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
The actual movements can be broken down into a rotation due to the roll (movement 1) and a rotation superimposed on that by the active system (movement 2). 
In the case of PASSIVE systems the body tilts naturally under the effect of the centrifugal force applied, which is proportional to the cant deficiency. 
Figure 1b shows the principle of inclination of a vehicle with natural or passive tilt. 
Fig. C31 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
C.8.3. Analysis of the formulae 
C.8.3.1. Basic formulae 
Depending on the different types of TBV to be investigated (coaches, power cars or multiple unit motor coaches) the corresponding formulae for the G1 gauge shall be used, to which shall be added all the modifications presented in this Appendix. 
C.8.3.2. Modifications to be made to the formulae for TBVs 
For TBVs the maximum tilt of the body corresponding to the maximum cant deficiency IP must be considered. Given this requirement, the following terms of the reduction formulae shall have to be reconsidered: 
a) Lateral plays: (1,465-d)/2, q and w [32] 
The sign of the lateral displacements, in general, should take account of the centrifugal effect. 
The changes required are discussed in § 8.3.2.1. 
b) Quasi-static displacements "z" 
The term z is valid provided that vehicles do not exceed, when running, the cant deficiency value IP = 200 mm. 
As TBVs can exceed this value and, in general, because of the fact that they can run with values of cant deficiency IP greater than those specified by the Permanent Way Department (IC), the formula needs some modifications which are discussed in § 8.3.2.2. 
c) For certain types of TBV, especially the active ones, a further term to take account of the body tilt imparted by the system will need to be added to the formulae for calculating the reductions (see 8.3.2.3). 
C.8.3.2.1. Expression for the values of the lateral plays when the body is tilted 
The condition of maximum body tilt occurs only when the vehicle runs round a curve with the maximum value of IP. 
As the vehicle is submitted to a very high centrifugal force towards the outside of the curve, the terms of the lateral displacements shall be reconsidered. 
- The play w shall be taken towards the outside of the curve. 
- For the plays (1,465 - d)/2 and q it is necessary to distinguish between bogie vehicles and vehicles with independent wheels. 
Bogie vehicles, calculation of play on the inside of the curve: 
On-line tests have shown that for bogie vehicles, some axles run round the curve with the flange in contact with the outer rail, while others do not maintain this contact constantly. As a result and for safety reasons, the plays mentioned above shall be taken equal to zero. 
Bogie vehicles, calculation of play on the outer side of the curve: 
The plays (1,465 - d)/2 and q shall be taken, likewise for reasons of safety, on the outside of the curve. 
Vehicles with independent wheels: 
The tests have confirmed that the plays (1,465 - d)/2 and q occur towards the outside of the curve. 
C.8.3.2.2. Quasi-static displacement of a TBV 
To obtain the clearances to structures, the Permanent Way Department must add certain terms to the dimension of the reference profile. The quasi-static displacements of vehicles are calculated with the formula below: 
The maximum allowable value for E or I is 200 mm. 
Each Infrastructure Manager fixes for its lines its own maximum value for I. The values generally used are between 90 and 180 mm. 
Vehicles must not exceed this maximum value of I when running. 
On the other hand, TBVs reach higher values. This means that their dimensions need to be checked with a different calculation for the quasi-static displacements. 
Just as for conventional vehicles, the effect of a cant deficiency induces in TBV units a tilting of the body around a longitudinal axis, a rotation which is due to the flexibility of the suspension system. In the formulae, the quasi-static displacements corresponding to this rotation are taken into consideration in the term "z". Because TBVs can run with cant deficiencies of up to Ip it is necessary to revise the calculation of this term (zP). 
It is appropriate to introduce this new term zP, the formulation of which takes account of the total quasi-static tilt due to IP, in relation to that considered by the Permanent Way Department, IC (see paragraphs 3.2.2.1 and 3.2.2.2). 
Moreover, for the active tilting systems, it is necessary to consider a supplementary term (see 3.2.3), because the tilting of the body to compensate for the centrifugal acceleration is independent of the tilt due to the roll. 
C.8.3.2.2.1. Expression of the quasi-static displacements zP for the reductions on the inside of the curve 
Under the effect of the lateral acceleration associated with IP values greater than 0, the body of the vehicle, because of the flexibility of the suspensions, tilts towards the outside of the curve when active tilting is used and towards the inside of the curve when passive tilting is used. The following figures show this type of displacement from the position I = 0. Due to the different modes of tilting, with the active system the displacements are largest at the upper part of the vehicle body, whereas with the passive system they are largest at the lower part of the vehicle body.

Note: The tilt imparted by the system is not represented here. 
- Since the reference profile is considered from the standpoint of the inside of the curve, the points of the vehicle situated at a height h%gt%hc move away from the profile. The value of this displacement in the calculation will carry a minus sign. 
The opposite is true for points situated at a height h %lt% hc.

The displacements corresponding to different tilts shown in Figures 2a and 2b are indicated below. 
For a TBV unit with an active system running on a curve with a cant deficiency IP the quasi-static displacements are: 
For a TBV unit with a passive system subjected to a cant deficiency IP the quasi-static displacements are: 
It is necessary to draw attention to the fact that the value of s is specific to the situation calculated and can, therefore, be influenced by the action of the body tilt system. 
C.8.3.2.2.2. Expression of the quasi-static displacements zP, for the reductions on the outer side of the curve 
Under the effect of the lateral acceleration (corresponding to values IP%gt%0) the body of an active TBV unit tilts towards the outside of the curve because of the flexibility of the suspension system and towards the inside of the curve for a passive TBV unit. 
Similarly to Figures 2a and 2b, the Figures 3a and 3b represent this type of displacement, from the position I = 0. 
Fig. C34: 
ACTIVE system 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
Note: The tilt imparted by the system is not represented here. 
- Since the reference profile is considered from the standpoint of the outside of the curve, the points of the vehicle situated at a height h%gt%hc move closer to the profile. The value of this displacement in the calculation will have a plus sign. 
- The opposite is true for the points situated at a height of h %lt% hc.

- The opposite is true for the points situated at a height of h %gt% hc. 
When the vehicles run in a curve they move closer to the reference profile (on the outer side) in proportion to the value of IP; if the condition IP %gt%IC, is present, the distances considered by the Permanent Way Department for the positioning of obstacles will not be sufficient. Since the position of obstacles cannot be questioned, the reductions calculated for vehicles should, if necessary, be increased by a value corresponding to the difference between the quasi-static displacements due to IP and those taken into account by the Permanent Way Department or: 
Active system 
Passive system 
It must be remembered that: 
- the formulae apply where IP %gt% IC; 
- it will be necessary to find in the application phase corresponding to a real case, the combination of the values for IP and IC which give a value of zP that maximises the reduction: 
- the tilting system of the vehicle must ensure the following for the intermediate values of IP (marked IP'), to which correspond the intermediate values of cant deficiency Ic': 
Furthermore, the conditions given in 5.1 must be met. 
C.8.3.2.3. ACTIVE systems: displacements due to body rotation 
When an active-system TBV runs over a curve at a speed such that IP%gt%0, based on measurement of the value of certain parameters (speed, cant gradient, curve radius) the tilting system establishes the angle of body tilt β. 
The angle β is independent of the tilt due to the flexibility of the suspensions. 
Fig. C36 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
n Figure 4 the following values are represented: 
ho: height of the centre of rotation of the body imposed by the system. 
β: value of the angle of body tilt, relative to the system bearing plane; this angle imposed by the system is a function of the cant deficiency IP. 
Since angle β can be as great as 10o, the vertical component of the displacement must not be overlooked and it shall be taken into account in the calculation for real cases. 
If only the lateral displacements are considered, approximate values can be found by the following formula: 
tan β (h - h0) 
This term, in light of the direction of rotation imposed by the system, 
- shall carry a positive sign in the calculations on the inside of the curve 
- shall carry a minus sign in the calculations on the outside of the curve. 
C.8.4. Associated Rules

- The expression of the term zP shall be detailed and explained, case by case, when the formulae are applied to each type of system, bearing in mind the different stops, the roll centre, etc. 
- It should be stressed that the parameters, s, hc and w, in agreement with the technical principles of the TBV unit, for any given vehicle have different values depending on the calculation cases involved. 
- The maximum values of the reductions shall be calculated depending on the different values likely to be taken by IP, IC (and by the angle β for active TBVs, see § 3.2.3). For this purpose the TBV Builder should bear in mind the most prominent places permitted on the bodies when running over different sections of line (straight track, transitions, curves) and the possible tolerances with respect to the effective position of the vehicle (due to the delay in system activation, inertia, friction, etc). 
- The parts of the TBVs which are not connected to the body and, therefore, do not tilt, always remain subject to a value of uncompensated acceleration greater than that normally accepted. For these items (such as the bogies and sometimes the pantograph), a supplementary term taking account of the reduction shall be used when the tilting body is checked. 
This term is of the form: S1,5Ip-Ich-hc 
Moreover, no account shall be taken of the term tan β (h - h0) for these parts (see § 3.2.3). 
- This Appendix has been developed on the basis of information applicable to the TBV units in service today. Other hypotheses and modifications to the formulae may be added, in the future, after new types of TBV units have been developed. 
- When the examination of all the cases which were thought to be critical has been completed, a comparison shall be made between the different permissible half-width dimensions and the smallest value at each of the heights h considered shall be selected. 
C.8.5. Comments 
C.8.5.1. Condition for adjusting the inclination (TBV units with active system) 
For the formulae that have been given in this Appendix for the calculation of the loading gauge of TBV units to be valid it is necessary that the tilt system guarantees that the body is inclined in a way that is proportional to the variation of the cant deficiency. 
For the passive systems this condition is obviously fulfilled as the tilt of the body is caused by the low cant. 
For TBV units with an active tilt system on the other hand, the values that the system imposes on the bodies are fixed by the design or adjustment of the system. 
These values shall meet the following conditions in order that the bodies do not exceed the specified profile: 
a) The intermediate values I’P, I’C and E' between 0 and the maximum value of the respective sizes, shall meet, from a point of view of the regulation of the tilting system, the following condition: 
I'PIP=I'CIC=E'E 
b) Moreover in the case of checking on the outside of the curve, in view of the fact that the centrifugal force tilts the body towards the outside (quasi-static displacement zP), the following condition, regarding the value of β for the adjustment shall be observed: 
tan β (h - h0) ≥ zp 
In other words, the effect of the system must be greater than or equal to the quasi-static effect. 
C.8.5.2. Condition concerning the speed of TBV units 
For TBVs, it is permissible to calculate a maximum speed from the standpoint of the loading gauge than for other vehicles. 
Reference should be made to the expression that relates the cant deficiency to the speed: 
The speeds vP and vC are respectively the value taken by the TBV and the corresponding value allowed for the track, according to the ruling speed for the line. 
Thus: VP≤IP+EIC+E·VC 
From this formula, it is possible to deduce the maximum speed value that must not be exceeded by the TBV, using the following formula: 
C.8.6. Appendix 4 Rolling Stock Loading Gauge 
Use of existing infrastructure clearances by vehicles with predefined parameters 
A bilateral agreement shall be required before applying this appendix. 
Example: 
On straight track in good maintenance condition with the usual defects in track geometry, the decisive criterion shall be the maximum distance between track centres; this equals the width of the reference profile plus margins for random movements of the vehicle due to defects in track geometry (D). 
t1 = lateral movement of the track 
t2 = impact of a cant or cross-level defect of 0,015 m 
t3i, a = oscillations towards the inside or towards the outside 
t4 and t5 = impact of load imbalance and of asymmetries 
The following parameters shall be used to determine the margins (clearances) to be added to the G1 reference profile: 
h = 3,25 m 
hc = 0,5 m 
s = 0,4 
The predefined parameters of the vehicle under examination can be used, for instance: 
h = 1,8 m (height above the running surface of a certain body section) 
hc = 0,7 m 
s = 0,24 
Based on the above parameters, the following values can be obtained: 
for profile G1 | D = 0,113 m | 
for the vehicle with predefined parameters | D’ = 0,058 m | 
The difference D - D’ = 0,055 m can be used as a basis for widening a vehicle with predefined parameters. 
If the additional clearance covering random movements is not calculated as described, but a flat overall value is defined, and if this results in smaller dimensions, this should be taken into consideration for the calculation of D-D’. 
Example: SNCF, V ≤ 120 km/h: DSNCF = 0,05 +0,03 = 0,08 m. 
The vehicle with predefined parameters could then be widened by 0,022 m at a height of 1,8,m

[2] This formula for n≥a-53gives reductions greater than or equal to those obtained using the formula for n%lt%a-53 
[6] This value applies to parts located more than 0,400 m above the running surface, with the exception of those covered by footnote (1) above 
[7] This value applies to those parts no more than 0,400 m above the running surface and those which may descend below this level as a result of wear and vertical movements. 
[8] This value applies to parts located more than 0,400 m above the running surface, with the exception of those covered by footnote (1) above. 
[9] This value applies to those parts no more than 0,400 m above the running surface and those which may descend below this level as a result of wear and vertical movements assessed. 
[10] In practice, formulae (105) and (110) are without effect, since variation of travel w takes effect when R %gt% 250 through the effect of variable stops.

[20] This value applies to parts located more than 0,400 m above the running surface, with the exception of those covered by footnote (1) above. 
[21] This value applies to those parts no more than 0,400 m above the running surface and those which may descend below this level as a result of wear and vertical movements. 
[22] In practice, formulae (205) and (210) have no effect, since the variation in play w, resulting from the variable stops taking effect, begins only when R%gt%250. 
[23] This value applies to parts located more than 0,400 m above the running surface, with the exception of those covered by footnote (1) above. 
[24] This value applies to those parts no more than 0,400 m above the running surface and those which may descend below this level as a result of wear and vertical movements. 
[25] This value applies to parts located more than 0,400 m above the running surface, with the exception of those covered by footnote (1) above. 
[26] This value applies to those parts no more than 0,400 m above the running surface and those which may descend below this level as a result of wear and vertical movements. 
[27] For powered units without fixed bogie pivots, see note in § 1.1. 
[28] If the play varies according to the track position radius, the maximum value of wi at pivot level (actual or theoretical) shall be taken from j'i, and the maximum value of wa and the corresponding value of wi taken from j'a. 
[29] The reduction to be applied for the same value of n is the greatest obtained with formula (603a) and (604a)

[31] The justification of the need to take account of this parameter, fixed by the Permanent Way Department of the Railways, in the rolling stock dimensional calculations is given in Section 3.2.2 of this Appendix. 
[32] For the TBV calculation this term must be measured at the height hc above the running surface of the rail. It can have different values for a same given vehicle, depending on configuration, according to the tilt technology and possible re-centring of the body.

ANNEX I 
INTERFACES OF BRAKING INTEROPERABILITY CONSTITUENTS 
I.1. DISTRIBUTOR 
The specification of the interoperability constituent distributor is described in 4.2.4.1.2.2 Braking Power and 4.2.4.1.2.7 Air Supply 
I.1.1. Distributor Interfaces 
I.1.1.1. Distributor valve 
A distributor is a pneumatic control valve. Its function is to control its output pressure as an inverse function of the variation of its input pressure. See Figs. I.1 and I.2. The performance of a distributor is specified by the following: 
- Graduable application and release of the brakes 
- Brake Application Time 
- Brake Release Time 
- Manual Distributor Release Valve 
- Automatic operation 
- Sensitivity and Insensitivity 
Fig.: I.1 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
Fig.: I.2 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
The distributor is controlled by the pressure in the brake pipe. The normal operating pressure of the brake pipe in a train shall be 5 bar with the Driver's Brake Controller in the "Release" position; however, the distributor shall function normally with a brake pipe pressure of 4 to 6 bar. The pressure drop in the brake pipe to obtain a full application must be 1,5 bar ± 0,1. The maximum output pressure obtained with this drop is 3,8 bar ± 0,1. The output pressure usually is limited to a maximum value. The normal operating pressure of the brake pipe is 5 bar, but the distributor must be able to operate normally with a brake pipe between 4 and 6 bar. The rate of change of the distributor output pressure shall be determined by the rate of change of the input pressure. (See Fig. I.3). 
Fig.: I.3 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
The distributor shall cause the brakes on a wagon to release by venting the brake cylinder pipe to atmosphere in response to an increase in brake pipe pressure following a brake application, see Fig. I.4. 
Fig.: I.4 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
It shall be possible to make small applications and releases of the output pressure by varying the input pressure and a change of 0,1 bar on the input will cause a change in the output. The variation in output pressure with the same input pressure shall not vary more than 0,1 bar between an application and release. 
The distributor shall not connect the brake pipe and reference control reservoir until the output pressure is less than 0,3 bar. This connection shall be allowed when the brake pipe has risen to within 0,15 bar of the operating pressure. 
The Brake Application Time is the time for increasing output pressure from when it starts to rise from 0 bar up to 95 % of the maximum output pressure when input pressure is reduced to 0 bar in less than 2 seconds. This is 3 to 5 seconds in "P" single stage, or 3 to 6 seconds in "P" with a load/empty or load proportional brake, and 18 to 30 seconds in "G" in a single-pipe operation. 
The Release Time is the time for reducing the output pressure from when it starts to fall from maximum down to 0,4 bar when input pressure is increased up to the operating pressure starting from 1,5 bar below it, in less than 2 seconds. This is 15 to 20 seconds in "P" and 45 to 60 seconds in "G". For freight wagons with a total weight higher than 70 tonnes the time in "P" can be 15 to 25 seconds. 
The distributor shall be able to be utilised either as "G", "P" or "G/P" or in the latter case there will be a changeover device allowing the change over between the timings. 
There shall be a Manual Release Function, which requires deliberate and intentional manual action in order to cancel the brake application (to release the distributor valve). 
The distributor must be Automatic and have the ability to ensure the maximum output pressure in case of loss of input pressure. 
The distributor must be inexhaustible and have the capability to give at least 85 % of the maximum output pressure, by an emergency application, under all operating conditions. The distributor shall maintain the output pressure compensating for leakage in the output volumes whilst there is air in the auxiliary reservoir. 
The filling of the auxiliary and control reservoirs on one vehicle shall be such that the release and filling of the reservoirs at the rear of the train are not impeded. It must also be such that there are not significant variations in the brake pipe pressure likely to cause operation of the brakes on the neighbouring vehicles. 
The distributor must operate normally in response to the input pressure when adjacent distributors are isolated or not functioning. 
The Sensitivity of the distributor will be such that it will come into operation within 1,2 seconds with an input pressure reduction of 0,6 bar in 6 seconds from the normal operating pressure. 
The Insensitivity of the distributor is such that it will not come into operation with an input reduction from the normal operating pressure of 0,3 bar in 60 seconds. 
Fig.: I.5 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
There shall be a Quick Service Function (accelerator) in a distributor valve which allows, when first applying the brake from the released position, the local fast venting of brake pipe pressure by a maximum of 0,4 bar when the brake pipe pressure at the front of the train falls by 0,3 bar. This is to provide pneumatic brake signal transmission through a train. 
There can be an Operating pressure overcharge which allows a build up of brake pipe pressure above normal operating pressure to 6 bar to reduce the release time and this can be present for up to 40 seconds in "G" mode and 10 seconds in "P" mode. The distributor shall not overcharge the control reservoir during this brake pipe overcharge period. After a full release of the brakes the distributor shall not operate when the brake pipe pressure is raised to 6 bar for 2 seconds, then reduced to 5,2 bar in 1 second followed by a return to normal operating pressure. 
The distributor shall have an Inshot function, which allows, when operated in the braking mode "G", a faster increase of the output pressure at the beginning of brake application. This will be about 10 % of the maximum output pressure. The purpose is quick build up of the necessary pressure for initiating the friction braking process. 
Fig.: I.6 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
I.2. RELAY VALVE FOR VARIABLE LOAD/AUTOMATIC EMPTY-LOAD CHANGE OVER BRAKE 
I.2.1. Relay valve for variable load 
A relay valve is a device that varies the application force of the brake system according to the mass of the wagon. Changes in the mass of the wagon shall automatically and continuously cause the brake force to be varied without significant delay. It shall not react to short shocks or short variations of the load at the wheels. It shall not alter the performance characteristics of the air-brake (see TSI, ch. 5.3.3.1) except in the case of brakes with pneumatically-controlled devices for the variation of the braking power, the release time is the time which must elapse before a pressure of 0,4 bar is seen in the relay control chamber (pilot pressure). During braking, the established brake force due to a brake demand shall not be changed by this device. It shall provide a minimum of 5 steps of brake in the service range between minimum and maximum brake force in all cases from an empty to a loaded wagon. Any air consumption of this device shall be as low as possible and not have any effect on the braking of the vehicle. 
I.2.2. Relay valve for automatic empty/load change over 
An Empty/Load relay valve is a device that varies the application force of the brake system at a single point in the mass range of a wagon. The empty or loaded position of this relay valve shall be automatically obtained when the mass of the wagon becomes respectively lower or higher than the changeover mass. Its performance shall not be affected by shocks and vibrations. A relay valve for empty/load must not alter the performance characteristics of the air brake (see TSI, ch. 5.3.3.1). 
I.3. WHEEL SLIDE PROTECTION DEVICE 
A Wheel slide protection (WSP) device is part of a system designed to make the best use of available adhesion by a controlled reduction and restoration of the brake force to prevent wheel sets from locking and uncontrolled sliding, thereby optimising stopping distance. The WSP device shall not alter the functional characteristics of the brakes. 
The speed of rotation of the wheelsets is calculated on the basis of information provided by sensors, and monitored by an automatic control system. These transmit commands to the WSP dump valves to reduce or restore braking power, either totally or partially. 
The system shall take permitted wheel diameter differences on a given vehicle into account when evaluating speed. 
The power supply to the WSP shall be so designed to ensure that the WSP powers up and that power is available when the vehicle is set in motion. WSP systems require a power supply to function and this can be provided by the vehicles or by the WSP itself. 
WSP systems shall be designed to function correctly allowing for fluctuations in voltage of ± 30 %. If the voltage fluctuation exceeds this limit, the WSP shall shut down without disturbing the braking system. As soon as the supply voltage reverts to the permitted range, the WSP shall automatically return to normal functioning. 
The WSP installation shall have its own protected circuit. Fuses or circuit breakers for the WSP shall be separated from others on the vehicle such that they cannot be confused with or operated in the same manner. Whenever there is power available, the WSP shall be supplied. Automatic cut-off of the supply is only permissible in the case of sleep-mode (no movement) or battery protection for battery safety reasons (degraded battery situation or low voltage caused by long-term lack of supply). 
The WSP shall be designed to minimise air consumption. 
Further specification of the interoperability constituent, wheel slide protection device, is described in 4.2.4.1.2.6 and 4.2.4.1.2.7 within the TSI. 
I.4. SLACK ADJUSTER 
Slack adjusters are necessary to automatically maintain a nominally constant clearance between the friction pair (wheel and brake block or disc and brake pad) in order to maintain the braking characteristics and guarantee the braking performance. 
The slack adjuster shall not absorb more than 2 kN of the brake application force. The performance characteristics of the slack adjuster shall not be varied by environmental conditions (vibrations, winter conditions, etc.). 
There is no requirement for interchangeability of slack adjuster, but if they are to be interchangeable the following space envelopes apply (only the values in the table are necessary). 
Interchangeable Slack adjusters which are placed within the underframe shall not exceed the following space envelope : 
- for loads up to a maximum of 75 kN. 
Fig.: I.7 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
- for loads greater than 75 kN. 
Fig.: I.8 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
I.5. BRAKE CYLINDER/ACTUATOR 
There is no requirement for interchangeability of brake cylinders/actuators, but if they are to be interchangeable the following clause applies (only the values in the table are necessary). 
Interchangeable brake cylinders for use with a tread brake, that are placed in the underframe or in a bogie have to have the following connecting dimensions in figure I.9.1: 
Fig.: I.9.1 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
The diameters of the pins and bushes of the articulated joints of the interchangeable brake cylinders shall conform to the following figure I.9.2. 
Fig.: I.9.2 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
I.6. PNEUMATIC HALF COUPLING 
The pneumatic half couplings for the automatic air brake pipe shall conform to Figs. I.10, I.12 and either I.13 or I.15. The nipple to connect to the end cock shall be as shown in Fig. I.10 and have a truncated internal Whitworth (BSPP) G 1 1/4” pipe thread. 
The pneumatic half couplings for the main reservoir pipe shall conform to Figs. I.11, I.14 and either I.13 or I.15. The nipple to connect to the end cock shall be as shown in Fig. I.10 (and is the same as for the automatic air brake pipe) and have a truncated internal Whitworth (BSPP) G 1 1/4” pipe thread. 
The internal diameter of the coupling hoses for both pipes shall be between 25 and 30 mm. The length shall be as shown in Figs. I.10 %amp% I.11. The length of these hoses when used with a swing head autocoupler shall be increased to 1080 mm for the automatic air brake pipe and 930 mm for the main reservoir pipe instead of the dimensions shown in I.10 %amp% I.11. Rubber hoses will generally be used for these couplings, but metallic hoses may be used if they are flexible enough. 
The coupling heads for the automatic air brake pipe shall conform to Fig. I.12. The coupling head for the main reservoir pipe shall conform to Fig. I.13. Both Figs. show the mandatory dimensions to ensure coupling, but the shape and the other dimensions are able to be varied provided the heads are designed to offer the least possible resistance to air flow. The coupling heads can be made as a single piece or two pieces as shown by the * in Figs. I.12 %amp% I.14. If the coupling head is made in a single piece the seal shown in I.13 shall be used, otherwise the seal shown in Fig. I.15 shall be used.

I.7. END COCK 
An End Cock is a device mounted in a pipe that will allow airflow through the pipe when the end cock is in the open position. When moved to the closed position it will prevent flow through the pipe and will vent the pipe on one side on the end cock. 
The following functional requirements are defined for the End Cock to ensure the airflow through the brake pipe and main reservoir pipe. The overall dimensions of the end cocks shall comply with Figs. I.17 %amp% I.18 or I.19 %amp% I.20 depending on the application on a vehicle with out or with an automatic coupler. 
Open and Closed positions : The handle position shall be the same on any vehicle, so the opening and closing of the cock shall be achieved by turning its spindle through a minimum of 90o and not more than 100o, although a rotation angle of 125o is permissible for cocks to be fitted to wagons without automatic couplers. Stops shall be provided at the extremes of rotation, so that the open and closed positions are achieved positively. The closed position is where the flow path between inlet and outlet ports is closed and the venting passage is open and connected to the pipe on the hose and coupling side of the cock. The cock handle is closed in the vertically upward position on the vehicle. The open position is where the flow path between inlet and outlet ports is fully open, and the venting passage is closed. The cock handle is open in the approximately horizontal position. 
Where a control shaft is used to operate the end cock it must be possible for the plug to be fitted with a forked lever in such a way that the rotation angle between the extreme conditions of the cock be symmetrical in relation to the perpendicular line to the longitudinal centre line of the cock (see Fig. I.20). 
Venting port : The end cock shall incorporate a venting port with a minimum area of 80 mm2, arranged so that when the cock is closed the compressed air from the coupling hose end of the cock (intake connection to vehicle) can be exhausted to atmosphere. Venting shall have commenced when the operation of the end cock has reduced the cross-sectional area of the bore of the end cock by one third. The venting port shall not be able to be obstructed when the cock is mounted on the end vehicle. 
Torque: All end cocks with mechanical detent, or with latch engaged shall not be operated by vibration or shocks. The end cock shall be able to be manually operated so the torque shall reach a value in the range of 9 Nm to 20 Nm for end cocks with detent and a maximum of 6 Nm for cocks with latch. 
Spindle handle of the end cock : Where the handle is detachable and the unique angular relationship between it and the spindle is not construction ally assured, it shall not be possible to assemble the handle to the spindle except where the axis of the handle and the diametrical spindle mark are aligned and the spindle shall be marked in accordance with Fig. I.16 or as otherwise specified by the purchaser. The relative position of the handle and spindle when assembled, shall remain under all conditions of operation and environment. If the handle of the end cock is detachable from the spindle it shall be positively located. 
Fig. I.16 
Marking on end of the spindle 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
Fall time : The air passages shall be designed to minimise the losses within the cock and the cross-sectional area shall not be smaller than the cross-sectional area of a plain pipe of 25 mm internal diameter. The fall time in pressure on opening the end cock should not be longer than that for an equivalent pipe of the same nominal diameter. 
Pneumatic shocks: The components shall be able to resist the pneumatic shocks to which the cock is subject when opening quickly. 
Connections: The body of the end cock shall have an internal Whitworth (BSPP) G1” or G1.1/4” thread, for connection to the brake or main reservoir pipe. The end of the body adjacent to the internal threads shall be of hexagonal form or have flats (see Fig. I.17). If required by the Purchaser, the body end can have a flat sealing face for Flange type of connections. The body of the end cock shall have an external thread for connection to the coupling hose in accordance with Fig. I.18.

I.8. Isolating device for distributor 
The handle of the isolating device must be in a vertical downward position when the brake is in use. Rotating the handle through a maximum angle of 90o shall isolate the brake. The cock handle shape shall conform to Fig. I.21 
Fig. I.21 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
The isolating device shall be fitted to the vehicle in such a way that the isolated (closed) and active (open) positions are clearly visible and the device can be easily operated from one side of the vehicle. 
It is recommended that the cock be fitted on the distributor or in close proximity to it. 
I.9. BRAKE PAD 
I.9.1. Purpose 
The pad is to be used as part of the friction brake of a vehicle, which is capable of providing pre-defined retardation levels as specified by the purchaser, by being applied to a brake disc friction face. The pad shall fulfil the following requirements: 
- Permit a braking moment or torque to be generated 
- Permit, by frictional engagement with a brake disc friction face, the conversion into heat of the kinetic and potential energy involved in retarding the vehicle or vehicles, which is attributed to the use of the disc brake. 
- Act as part of a holding or parking brake by frictional engagement with a brake disc friction face. 
I.9.2. Operational 
The design and manufacture of the pad shall, for all intended operating conditions, take into account the following criteria. 
Performance 
- The maximum specified retardation to be achieved in full service and emergency braking conditions 
- The rotational speed range of the brake disc 
- The specified requirements for any holding or parking brake facility. 
- The range of specific pressure of the pad friction surface on the disc friction face 
- The type of material used in the manufacture of the brake disc friction face. 
- The quantity of brake energy to be converted and its rate of conversion and dissipation 
- The temperature of the brake disc friction face 
Service and life cycle costs 
- The integrity and wear rate of the pad friction material and brake disc friction face 
- The need to prevent the detachment of any part of the friction material from the pad throughout its useable thickness. 
- The need to prevent deformation of the pad backplane in any plane throughout the useable thickness of the friction material. 
I.9.3. Pad design 
The interface dimensions for the Interoperability Constituent brake pad shall conform to figures I.9.3.1 and I.9.3.2 for 200 cm2 and 175 cm2 brake pads. 
Figure 9.3.1 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
Figure 9.3.2 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
I.9.4. Frictional Performance 
General requirements 
Pads of the same size, with the same nominal friction coefficient and used in the same application, may produce different frictional characteristics depending on the pad material type and formulation. 
As far as possible, the friction coefficient must be independent of the initial braking speed, the specific pressure on the brake disc friction face, the temperature of the friction face and atmospheric conditions. The friction coefficient should also be independent of the degree of bedding of the pad friction surface on the brake disc friction face 
Specific requirements 
The purchaser shall supply details of the range of duty level (maximum speed/braked load per disc/deceleration/disc type and material/any other specific requirements) that the pad should be capable of meeting. 
I.10. BRAKE BLOCKS 
I.10.1. Purpose 
The block is to be used as part of the friction brake of a vehicle, which is capable of providing pre-defined retardation levels as specified by the purchaser, by being applied to the tread of the wheel. The block shall fulfil the following requirements: 
- Permit a braking moment or torque to be generated 
- Permit, by frictional engagement with the wheel tread, the conversion into heat of the kinetic and potential energy involved in retarding the vehicle, or vehicles, which is attributed to the use of the tread brake. 
- Act as part of a holding or parking brake by frictional engagement with the wheel tread. 
I.10.2. Materials 
The brake block, in the case of maintenance related replacement only, can be manufactured in cast iron, composite or sintered material. For sintered blocks, as far as possible, the friction coefficient must be independent of the initial braking speed, the specific pressure on the wheel tread, the temperature of the friction face and atmospheric conditions. The friction coefficient should also be independent of the degree of bedding of the block friction surface on the wheel tread. 
This Annex does not provide any specification related to composite blocks. 
I.10.3. Interface with Block Holder 
The interface dimensions for the single block and double block format, and the key to secure them shall conform to Fig I.10.3.1 for cast iron blocks 320 mm long and Fig I.10.3.2 for double blocks 250 mm long. Fig I.10.3.3 shows the special features to be observed in order to ensure interchangeability of composite blocks of the same type and non-interchangeability with cast iron blocks for blocks 320 mm long. Fig I.10.3.4 shows the equivalent features for double composite blocks 250 mm long.

I.11. Brake Pipe Emptying Accelerator valve 
A brake pipe emptying accelerator valve is a device connected to the brake pipe of a vehicle, which operates in response to seeing a rapid fall in brake pipe pressure to ensure a continuing rapid fall to below 2.5 bar. 
Brake pipe emptying accelerators shall be able to operate with all interoperable distributors and existing interoperable brake pipe emptying accelerators. The brake pipe-emptying accelerator shall be ready to operate when the brake pipe has reached its operating (running) pressure. The following operating conditions are defined in relation to a 5 bar brake pipe operating (running) pressure, but no functional errors shall occur in the operation of brake pipe emptying accelerator at operating (running) pressures of between 4 and 6 bar. 
When an emergency brake application occurs, the brake pipe emptying accelerators shall create a sufficiently rapid reduction in brake pipe pressure to ensure the rapid increase in brake cylinder pressure on every vehicle in the train set. When the pressure in the brake pipe has fallen quickly to below 2.5 bar, and within no more than 4 seconds after the accelerator commences operation, the accelerator shall stop venting air in such a way that the brake pipe can rapidly be refilled. 
The brake pipe-emptying accelerator shall exhaust the air from the brake pipe without causing any adverse effect on vehicle/train behaviour. 
The brake pipe emptying accelerator shall not come into operation due to the effect of an operating pressure overcharge, which allows a build up of brake pipe pressure above normal operating pressure to 6 bar and this can be present for up to 40 seconds in "G" mode and 10 seconds in "P" mode. The brake pipe emptying accelerator shall not come into operation after a full release if the brake pipe is raised to 6 bar for 2 seconds and reducing it to 5.2 bar in 1 second followed by a return to normal operating pressure. 
The operation of the brake pipe-emptying accelerator shall not be affected by an individual vehicle, where a brake pipe emptying accelerator is not fitted or the brake has been isolated. This shall apply irrespective of the position of that vehicle and of the train consist. 
The brake pipe emptying accelerator shall not come into operation when an emergency brake application is made after a full service brake application. 
The brake pipe emptying accelerator shall come into operation no later than 2 seconds after the pressure in the brake pipe has fallen from 5 to 3.2 bar within 3 seconds. 
The brake pipe emptying accelerator shall not come into operation when the pressure in the brake pipe falls uniformly from 5 to 3.2 bar over 6 seconds with the brake inoperative. When the brake is operative the brake pipe is to fall at the same rate (5 to 3.2 bar over 6 seconds), but down to 2.5 bar without the brake pipe emptying accelerator operating. 
The brake pipe emptying accelerator shall not operate during the initial stage of service braking due to operation of the internal distributor accelerator valve. This test is carried out on a test rig giving the brake pipe fall as shown on Fig. I.22. The test rig shall drop the brake pipe from 5 to 4.5 bar within 1 second, with the initial rate of 2 bar/second from 5 to 4.7 bar. The brake pipe emptying accelerator shall not come into operation during this test. 
If the brake pipe emptying accelerator is incorporated in the distributor, it must be inoperative after the brake has been isolated.

I.12.2. Empty/Load Changeover device 
The transmission of the variation in load (empty or loaded) to the braking control system (empty/load relay) can be purely mechanical or pneumatic. The method of producing the pneumatic signal can be a mechanically operated pneumatic device, a hydraulic to pneumatic converter device or an elastomeric to pneumatic converter device. If the pneumatic device is one producing a step in signal pressure between empty and loaded, the automatic empty/loaded changeover device shall operate safely — correctly with a minimum control pressure of 3 bar in "loaded".

J.1. STATIC TESTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL IN-SERVICE LOADS 
Definitions of Applied Loads 
The applied loads consist of: 
- vertical and transverse loads, 
- loads due to roll, 
- loads due to braking, 
- torsional loads. 
Vertical and Transverse Loads 
The vertical and transverse loads are calculated by reference to the nominal bogie load (for example: bogie for 20 t or 22,5 t on-rail axle load). 
In order to take the maximum dynamic load into account: 
- The vertical load to be applied to the pivot bearing shall be: 
- Fz max. = 1,5 Fz, with Fz = 4Qo-m+g (for 2-axle bogies) 
- Fz max. = 1,5 Fz, with Fz = 6Qo-m+g (for 3-axle bogies) 
If only the vertical load due to bounce is to be simulated, a load of 2 Fz shall be applied to the pivot bearing only. 
The transverse load to be applied to the bogie shall be: 
- Fy max. = 210+2Q03 kN (for two-axle bogies) 
- Fx max. = 8310+ 2Q03 kN (for three-axle bogies) 
NB: The transverse loads for 3-axle bogies given are based on the load distribution recorded during running trials for the qualification of bogie type 714. For a different bogie type, the load distribution recorded during running trials with the bogie type shall be used. 
Loads due to roll 
The roll coefficient α is taken to be equal to 0,3 for a spacing between the friction pads of 1700 mm (standard 2-axle bogies). 
If the spacing between the friction pads (2 bg) differs from 1700 mm, the value for α should be: 
α = 0,317002bg 
Loads Due To Braking 
The loads due to braking FB correspond to 120 % of the forces resulting from emergency braking. 
On the bogie under test, these loads due to braking FB result in: 
- deceleration loads, 
- contact loads, 
- loads applied to the brake linkages. 
Torsional Loads 
Loads on the bogie frame, when the bogie with its suspension is subjected to a maximum track twist of 10 ‰. 
Test Procedure 
Strain gauges and strain rosettes are attached to the bogie frame at all highly stressed points, in particular in zones of stress concentration. Positioning of the gauges shall be determined, for example, by means of strain indicating varnish. 
The test shall be carried out in accordance with Figure 1 and Table J5 (for 2-axle bogies) or Figure 2 and Table J6 (for 3-axle bogies). 
The test loads shall be applied in steps. Loads with values corresponding to 50 % and 75 % of the maximum values shall be applied before applying the full load configuration. 
Results To Be Obtained 
The elastic limit of the material shall not be exceeded for any load case. 
After removal of the test load there shall not be any evidence of permanent deformation.

J.2. STATIC TESTS WITH NORMAL IN-SERVICE LOADS 
Definitions of applied loads. 
The applied loads consist of: 
- vertical loads on the pivot bearing and friction pads, 
- a transverse load, 
- loads due to braking, 
- torsional loads. 
Vertical loads and loads due to roll 
The vertical loads on the pivot bearing and friction pads shall be calculated by reference to the nominal bogie load. They depend on: 
- Fz, the static load exerted by the wagon body on each bogie 
- α, the roll coefficient 
- β, the bounce coefficient 
The roll coefficient α is taken to be equal to 0,2 for a spacing between the friction pads of 1700 mm (standard 2-axle bogies). 
If the spacing between the friction pads (2bg) differs from 1700 mm, the value for α should be: 
α = 0,217002bg 
The bounce coefficient β that represents the vertical dynamic behaviour of the bogie shall be taken to be equal to 0,3 (the normal value for wagon bogies). 
Transverse load 
The transverse load shall be equal to: 
- Fy = 0,4 x 0,5 Fz + m+g (for 2-axle bogies) 
- Fy = 0,53 x 0,5 Fz + m+g (for 3-axle bogies) 
Loads Due To Braking 
The loads due to braking correspond to 100 % of the forces resulting from emergency braking. 
On the bogie under test, these loads due to braking result in the following loads being applied: 
- deceleration loads 
- contact loads 
- Loads applied to the brake linkages 
Torsional Loads 
Track twist, referenced to the bogie wheelbase, is taken to be equal to 5 ‰. 
This twist g+ shall be simulated either by moving the supports or by applying the corresponding calculated reaction forces. 
Test Procedure 
Strain gauges and strain rosettes shall be attached to the bogie frame at all highly stressed points, in particular in zones of stress concentration. 
The test consists of applying various load configurations to the bogie frame that simulate: 
- running on straight track 
- running in curves 
- dynamic load variations due to roll and bounce 
- braking 
- track twist 
The various load cases to be applied are described in Figure 3 and Table 7 (for two-axle bogies) and Figure 4 and Table 8 (for three-axle bogies). 
After application of the first seven load cases without simulation of track twist, four further tests shall be carried out by repeating load cases 4, 5, 6 and 7 with superposition of the track twist (value as specified for the bogie with its suspension). 
For each of these four new load cases, the loads due to twist shall be applied first in one direction and then in the other. 
The introduction of the track twist shall not modify the sum of the vertical forces. 
Tests with application of loads corresponding to the loads due to braking shall be carried out if the results of the tests according to Appendix A show them to be necessary (elastic limit exceeded during those tests). 
Results To Be Obtained 
At each measuring point, the stresses σ1…σn shall be recorded for each of the load cases defined above. 
From these n values, the minimum value σmin., and the maximum value σmax. are taken in order to determine: 
σmean = σmax + σmin2 
Δσ = σmax - σmin2 
The behaviour of materials, including welded joints and other types of fastening, under fatigue loading should be based on current international or national standards, or alternative sources of equivalent standing such as the one based on ERRI B12 Committee report RPI7, wherever such sources are available. 
Suitable data shall generally exhibit the following characteristics: 
a high probability of survival (i.e. preferably 97,5 %, but at least 95 %); 
classification of details according to the component or joint geometry (including stress concentration); 
derivation of the limiting values from small-scale samples using a test technique and previous experience to guarantee their applicability to full size components. 
If the stress limits to be respected are those given in the fatigue strength diagrams in ERRI B12 Committee report RPI7, it will be permissible to exceed these stress limits by up to 20 % at a limited number of measurement points, which shall then be monitored with particular care during the fatigue testing. If no incipient cracks are found during testing, the stresses exceeding the limit recorded during static testing shall be accepted and the bogie shall be approved.

J.3. FATIGUE TESTS 
Definitions of applied loads 
The applied loads consist of: 
- vertical loads on the pivot bearing and friction pads 
- a transverse load 
- loads due to braking 
- torsional loads 
Vertical Loads And Loads Due To Roll 
- The vertical loads on the pivot bearing and friction pads shall be calculated by reference to the nominal bogie load. They depend on: 
- Fz, the static load exerted by the wagon body on each bogie 
- α, the roll coefficient = 0,2 
- β, the bounce coefficient = 0,3 
Fz is a static load. The loads due to the coefficient α are considered to be "quasi static". The loads due to the coefficient β are considered to be "dynamic". 
The roll coefficient α is taken to be equal to 0,2 for a spacing between the friction pads of 1700 mm (standard two-axle bogies). If the spacing between the friction pads (2bg) differs from 1700 mm, the value for α shall be: 
α = 0,217002bg 
Transverse Loads 
The transverse loads consist of two components: 
- Two-axle bogies: 
- quasi-static load: Fyq = 0,1 Fz + m+g 
- dynamic load: Fyq = 0,1 Fz + m+g 
- Three-axle bogies: 
- quasi-static load: Fyq = 0,133 Fz + m+g 
- dynamic load: Fyd = 0,133 Fz + m+g 
Loads Due To Braking 
The loads due to braking correspond to 100 % of the forces resulting from emergency braking. 
On the bogie under test, these loads due to braking result in the following loads being applied: 
- deceleration loads, 
- contact loads, 
- loads applied to the brake linkages. 
Torsional Loads 
Track twist, referenced to the bogie wheelbase, shall be 5 ‰. 
Test Procedure 
The fatigue tests consist of alternating quasi-static and dynamic load sequences that represent running through right and left-hand curves. 
If the static tests defined in Appendix B have shown that the track twist induced stresses only in limited zones of the bogie frame, where the stresses caused by the vertical and transverse loads are minor, the fatigue test, as a first stage, shall be performed with only vertical and transverse loads. 
In this case, the vertical and transverse quasi-static and dynamic loads shall vary with time as shown in the diagrams in Figures 3, 5, 6 and 7 (for two-axle bogies) or in Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 (for three-axle bogies). 
In each sequence corresponding to a curve to the right or to the left, the number of dynamic cycles, vertically and transversely, shall be 20. 
The dynamic variations of the vertical and transverse loads shall be of the same frequency and shall be in phase, as shown in the diagrams. The number of sequences simulating right hand curves and left hand curves in the test shall be the same. 
In this first test stage, the number of cycles of dynamic load variations shall be 6 × 106. 
The second test stage shall consist of 2 × 106 cycles, with the static forces unchanged and the quasi-static and dynamic forces multiplied by 1,2. 
The third test stage shall also consist of 2 × 106 cycles and is performed as the second stage, but with the factor 1,2 replaced by 1,4. 
Tests with application of loads corresponding to the loads due to braking shall be carried out if the results of the tests according to section 2 show them to be necessary (elastic limit exceeded during those tests). 
Torsional Loads 
A total of 106 alternating torsional load cycles shall be applied in all: 
- 6 × 105 during the first test stage 
- 2 × 105 during each of the other two stages 
When specifying the torsional tests, the results of the static tests and the capabilities of the existing test facilities shall be taken into account. 
If the static tests have shown that the bogie frame is not affected by track twist, it shall not be taken into account. 
If the static tests in Appendix B show that the effects of the track twist loads are clearly different from those resulting from the vertical and transverse forces (e.g. because the stresses occur in different zones), the 6 × 105 plus twice 2 × 105 cycles of torsional loading can be applied separately from the vertical and transverse loads. Otherwise, the test setup shall be adapted in order to apply the vertical, transverse and track twist loads simultaneously. 
The loads that simulate the effect of track twist shall correspond to those that occur when the suspension is functioning with damping. 
Results To Be Obtained 
No cracks shall be found after application of the 6 × 106 cycles of the first test stage. This shall be confirmed by non-destructive inspection (magnetic particle or dye penetration test) after every 1 × 106 cycles. 
At the end of the second test stage, only the occurrence of small cracks, that would not require immediate repairs if they occurred in service, shall be acceptable. 
The evolution of the stresses at the locations of highest stress found during the static test (paragraph 6.1.1.2.1.3) shall be monitored by means of strain gauges during the fatigue test, and in particular where stresses exceeding the stress limit have been tolerated in accordance with paragraph 6.1.1.2.1.3

J.5. OVERVIEW/GUIDELINES 
The tests can be divided into three groups: 
- Static tests with exceptional in-service loads 
These tests verify that there is no risk of permanent and visible deformation of the bogie frame due to the superposition of the maximum loads that can occur in service. 
- Static tests to simulate normal in-service dynamic loads 
These tests verify that there is no risk of fatigue cracks occurring due to the superposition of in-service loads. 
- Fatigue tests 
The purpose of these tests is to determine the service life of the bogie frame, to detect potential hidden weak spots — in particular at locations where it is not possible to attach strain gauges, — and to assess the safety margin. 
Common Conditions For Rig Tests 
The tests shall be performed using a test set-up that allows the application and distribution of the loads exactly at the same locations where they occur in service, while at the same time correctly simulating the play and the degrees of freedom associated with the suspension and the elements connecting the bogie to the body. 
The tests can be performed with or without the suspension. 
The suspension damping devices shall be de-activated so as to prevent friction. 
The constructional characteristics of the bogie shall be taken into account when determining the manner in which the loads and the resulting reaction forces are applied to the bogie frame. The sketch below shows an example of the application of the loads on 2-axle bogies. 
The loads to be applied are detailed in Appendices A, B and C.

L.1 DESIGN ASSESSMENT 
L.1.1 General 
This chapter describes the assessment methods for wheel design in order to meet the performance requirements. There are three main aspects of a wheel's performance, each of which has different aims: 
- Geometrical 
- to ensure compatibility with the track 
- to ensure compatibility with the axle 
- Thermo mechanical: 
- to manage wheel deformation 
- to ensure that braking does not induce broken wheels 
- Mechanical: 
- to ensure compatibility with the intended axle load 
- to ensure that wheels do not fail due to fatigue 
L.1.2 Design parameters to be assessed. 
L.1.2.1 Parameters for geometrical compatibility 
There are three sets of parameters that are linked to functional, assembly or maintenance purposes. 
- Functional purposes 
- Nominal tread diameter: it affects buffer height and the loading gauge. 
- Rim width: it interfaces with Switches and Crossings. 
- Cone angle of the tread: it influences the stability of the vehicle 
- Tread profile outside of conical part of the tread 
- Flange height, thickness and angle 
- Transition between the flange and the active part of the tread 
- Rim position with reference to the wheel seat position on the axle 
- Parallelism of bore diameter 
- Assembly purposes 
- Bore diameter 
- Hub length in order to ensure an adequate overhang of the wheel hub on the axle wheel seat. 
- Maintenance purposes 
- Wear limit diameter of the tread 
- Wear groove shape 
- Geometry of the area for wheel clamping on reprofiling machines 
- Position of the hole for oil injection of dismantling 
- General rim shape in order to allow ultrasonic residual stress measurement for tread braked wheels. 
L.1.2.2 Parameters for thermo mechanical Compatibility 
Wheels shall be capable of absorbing the heat energy that is dissipated during service. This amount of energy generated is dependent upon: 
- The energy created by the friction of the brake blocks on the tread . 
- Type of brake blocks (nature, dimensions and number) 
L.1.2.3 Parameters for mechanical assessment 
- Maximum axle load of wheelset 
- Nature of the duty cycle 
- description of the lines: geometrical quality of track, curve parameters, maximum speed... 
- proportion of time travelling on these differing lines 
- Distance travelled during the whole life of the wheel 
L.1.3 Assessment of geometrical Compatibility 
The drawing of the wheel shall be in conformity with the requirements that are defined according to the paragraph above: parameters for geometrical compatibility. 
L.1.4 Assessment of thermo mechanical compatibility 
L.1.4.1 General procedure 
All new designs of wheels shall be fully assessed using methods that are appropriate to the application to demonstrate that they satisfy the requirements set out in this Annex. 
This assessment shall be composed of three steps. If step 1 is passed, no further assessment is necessary. If step 1 is failed, step 2 shall be applied. If step 2 is passed, no further assessment is necessary. Step 3 assesses a marginal failure of steps 1 and 2. If step 3, is failed the wheel shall be considered to be non-compliant. For each step, tests shall be made on a wheel with a new rim (tread at its nominal diameter) and on a wheel with a worn rim (tread at its wear limit diameter). 
In each case, the wheel selected for test shall have the worst case rim geometry for thermo mechanical behaviour; a validated numerical simulation shall confirm the selection. Where it is not possible to test the worst case wheel, the results shall be extrapolated to the worst case by the same numerical simulation. 
L.1.4.2 First step: Braking bench test. 
L.1.4.2.1 Test procedure. 
The power to be applied for 45 minutes during this test shall be equal to 1,2Pa. 
where 
m = vehicle mass on rail per wheel (kg) 
g = gravitational acceleration (m/s2) 
slope = average slope of the line (slope in ‰/1000) 
γ = deceleration of the train (m/s2) 
Va = vehicle velocity (m/s) 
Refer to same slope as in 4.2.4.1.2.5 South Gothard slope, one calculation brake down the Gothard at a speed of 80kmh. 
L.1.4.2.2 Decision criteria. 
Three criteria shall be satisfied simultaneously for the new wheel and for the worn wheel. 
For the new wheel: 
1. maximum lateral displacement of the rim during braking + 3/-1 mm 
2. residual stresses in the rim after cooling: 
- σrn ≤ +Σr N/mm2 as an average over three measurements 
- σin ≤ +(Σr + 50) N/mm2 for each measurement 
3. maximum lateral displacement of the rim after cooling + 1,5/-0,5 mm. 
Lateral displacement is considered to be positive when the distance between the flange backs increases. 
For the worn wheel: 
1. maximum lateral displacement of the rim during braking + 3/-1mm 
2. residual stresses in the rim after cooling: 
- σrw≤ +(Σr + 75) N/mm2 as an average over three measurements 
- σiw≤ +(Σr + 100) N/mm2 for each measurement 
3. maximum lateral displacement of the rim after cooling + 1,5/-0,5mm 
The value of Σr shall be determined according to the steel grade requirements of the wheel rim. For ER6 and ER7 grades of EN13262, Σr= 200 N/mm2. 
For other steel grades, another value for Σr shall be agreed. 
L.1.4.3 Second step: Wheel fracture bench test.

L.1.4.4 Third step: Field braking test. 
L.1.4.4.1 General. 
This third step shall take place if one result of the first step is above a decision criterion and if the wheel is not rejected after the second step. 
L.1.4.4.2 Test procedure. 
The power to be applied during this test shall be as defined in Step 1 of this assessment. 
L.1.4.4.3 Decision criteria. 
Three criteria shall be satisfied simultaneously for the new wheel and for the worn wheel. 
For the new wheel: 
1. maximum lateral displacement of the rim during braking + 3/-1mm. 
2. residual stresses in the rim after cooling: 
- σrn ≤ + (Σr - 50) N/mm2 as an average over three measurements 
- σin ≤ + Σr N/mm2 for each measurement 
3. maximum lateral displacement of the rim after cooling + 1,5/-0,5mm. 
For the worn wheel: 
1. maximum lateral displacement of the rim during braking + 3/-1mm 
2. residual stresses in the rim after cooling: 
- σrw ≤ +Σr N/mm2 as an average over three measurements 
- σiw ≤ + (Σr + 50) N/mm2 for each measurement 
3. maximum lateral displacement of the rim after cooling + 1,5/-0,5mm 
The value of Σr shall be fixed according to steel grade requirements of the wheel rim. 
For ER6 and ER7 grades of EN13262, Σr= 200 N/mm2. 
For other steel grades, another value for Σr shall be agreed. 
L.1.5 Assessment of mechanical compatibility 
L.1.5.1 General procedure. 
This assessment shall be composed of two steps. If step 1 is passed no further assessment is necessary. If step 1 is failed step 2 shall be applied. If step 2 is failed the wheel shall be considered to be non-compliant. The purpose of this assessment is to verify that no fatigue cracks initiate in the web during the whole life of the wheel. 
The worst case wheel geometry for mechanical behaviour shall be assessed. Where the bench test wheel is not the worst case, test parameters shall be extrapolated to the worst case by a validated numerical simulation. 
L.1.5.2 First step: calculation. 
L.1.5.2.1 Applied forces. 
The forces to be applied shall use the force P as a basis. 
P is half the vertical force per wheelset on rail. 
Three load cases shall be considered (see fig. L1): 
- Case 1: straight track 
Fz = 1,25 P 
Fy1 = 0 
- Case 2: full curves 
Fz = 1,25 P 
Fy2 = 0,6 P P for non-guiding wheelsets 
Fy2 = 0,7 P P for guiding wheelsets 
- Case 3: negotiation of points and crossings 
Fz = 1,25 P 
For non-guiding wheelsets 
Fy2 = 0,36 P | Fy3 = 0,6 | 
For guiding wheelsets 
Fy2 = 0,42 P | Fy3 = 0,6 |

Annex M 
VEHICLE TRACK INTERACTION AND GAUGING 
Axle 
M.1. Design assessment 
M.1.1. General 
The following major phases for the definition of an axle are: 
a) Identification of the forces to be taken into account and calculation of the moments on the various sections of the axle. 
b) Selection of the diameters for axle-body and journals. On the basis of the selected diameters, calculation of the diameters for the other sections. 
c) The options taken shall be verified by: 
- Stress calculation for each section. 
- The permissible stresses are essentially defined by: 
- The steel grade. 
- Whether the axle is solid or hollow. 
M.1.2. Identification of forces and calculation of moments. 
Two types of forces shall be addressed: 
- Masses in motion. 
- Braking. 
M.1.3. Geometrical and dimensional tolerances 
M.1.3.1. Selection of the diameters for journals and axle body. 
In selecting the diameters of the journals and axle body, reference shall be made initially to existing sizes of associated components e.g. bearings. 
The selection of diameters shall be verified by comparing the calculated stresses with the maximum permissible stresses. A very shallow groove (0,1 to 0,2 mm) shall be provided, so that the end of the inner bearing ring does not cause any notch effect on the journal. 
M.1.3.2. Selection of the diameters of the various seats from the diameter of the axle body or of the journals. 
M.1.3.2.1. Collar bearing surface. 
In order to standardise whenever possible, the diameter of the collar bearing surface shall be 30 mm greater than that of the journal. The transition between the journal and the collar bearing surface shall be provided as illustrated in figure M3 (detail V). 
M.1.3.2.2. Transition between the collar bearing surface and wheelseat. 
In order to standardise whenever possible, this transition shall have only one radius of 25 mm. 
If this value cannot be met, the highest possible value shall be selected in order to minimise the stress concentration on this area. 
M.1.3.2.3. Wheelseat. 
The ratio between the wheelseat and the axle body diameters shall be at least equal to 1,12 at the wheel seat wear limit. It is recommended that this ratio is at least 1,15 for an axle in new condition. 
The transition between these two areas shall be provided in such a way that the stress concentration remains at the lowest possible level. 
In order to have the lowest value of the stress concentration factor at the transition between axle body and wheelseat, the value of the biggest radius on the axle body side shall be at least 75mm. 
M.1.4. Maximum permissible stresses. 
The maximum permissible stresses shall be derived from: 
- The fatigue limit in rotating bending for the various areas of the axle. 
- The value of a factor of safety "S" which varies with the steel grade. 
M.1.4.1. Steel grade EA1N 
The following values shall be used: 
- For a solid axle : 
- 200 N/mm2 without press-fit. 
- 120 N/mm2 with press-fit. 
- For a hollow axle : 
- 200 N/mm2 without press-fit. 
- 110 N/mm2 with press-fit (apart from journal). 
- 94 N/mm2 with press-fit on the journal. 
- 80 N/mm2 for the surface of the bore. 
For solid and hollow axles, the value of security coefficient "S", by which fatigue limits shall be divided to obtain the maximum permissible stresses is 1,2. 
For hollow axles, these permissible stresses are applicable if the ratio of journal diameter to bore diameter is %lt% 3 or the ratio of wheelseat diameter to bore diameter is %lt% 4. 
M.1.4.2. Steel grades other than EA1N. 
The fatigue limit shall be determined for the following areas of the axle: 
- The surface of the axle body. 
- The bearing surface with an equal clamping condition at the wheelseats. 
In the case of a hollow axle, the fatigue limit shall also be determined for the bearing surface with an equivalent bearing/axle interference condition. 
- The surface of the bore. 
The value of the factor of safety "S" shall be determined with regard to the sensitivity of the steel grade to the notch effect.

Permissible stresses for static test methods 
N.1 Static test methods 
N.1.1 Limits values for static tests to verify fatigue strength 
Definition of the notch cases 
The limit stresses to be used for wagon body tests are indicated, for three steels with a minimum tensile resistance of 370, 420 and 570 MPa, and for five notch cases defined in a general way as follows : 
- Case A: Parent metal, 
- Case B: Butt weld, 
- Case C: Butt weld with inertia change, 
- Case D: Fillet weld, 
- Case E: Projection weld. 
These five notch cases do not cover the full range of structures and, in practice, it is necessary to choose the most suitable notch case for each welded zone tested. 
To facilitate and standardize these choices figures in Table Nx gives practical examples of welded joints which occur frequently in vehicle body structures and in bogies frames.

ANNEX R 
VEHICLE TRACK INTERACTION AND GAUGING 
Longitudinal compressive forces 
R.1. TESTS CONDITIONS 
R.1.1. Track 
The track for the tests shall consist in an S-format curve of R = 150m. Curves are separated by a section of straight track measuring 6m in length. 
Fig. R1 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
The track for the tests shall have - 0- cant. The average gauge is between 1,450-1,465 mm. 
R.1.2. Test train 
- Standard configuration 
Use of slave wagons with the following characteristics: 
| Front wagon | Tail wagon | 
Type | Fcs or Tds | Rs | 
Length over buffer: | 9,64 m | 19,90 m | 
Wheelbase: | 6,00 m | 13,00 m | 
The fig. R2 is an example of a test train with the above-mentioned standard configurations. 
The slave wagon must be laden (20tons axle load) and the test wagon shall be empty. 
- Complete configuration 
By long two axles freight wagons with LoB ≥ 15,75 m is a special test in a three wagon train configuration necessary (test wagen and two slave wagons with the same geometrical parameters). 
Fig. R2 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
To calculate the longitudinal compressive force, use shall be made of 2 or 4 axle intermediate wagons fitted at one end with central-buffer coupling (incorporating a stress recorder) [1]. 
R.1.3. Buffer type 
The slave wagons must be fitted with category A non-pivoting buffers (590kN end-stroke force) which have already been used in revenue service. The buffers on the slave wagons shall have spherical bearing surfaces of R = 1500 mm. The test wagon shall be fitted with the same buffer type as the model to be used in its future operating. 
When starting the tests, the buffer bearing surfaces shall show no signs of wear. 
R.1.4. Carrying out the tests 
The screw couplers between the test wagon and the slave wagons are to be tightened in such a way that when on the straight track the buffer plates are in contact without pre-tensioning 
The vertical offset of buffer centre-lines between the slave wagons and the test wagon will need to be approximately 80mm [2]. 
The buffer plates shall have a low friction surface, such as lightly greased steel. Any building up of material as a result of scratches must be removed after each test. Buffer-plate pairs shall be replaced where, as a result of scratches or deformation, results obtained differ considerably from those already recorded. 
The test train shall reverse back along an S-shaped curve at a speed of 4 to 8 km/h with a longitudinal compressive force that remains virtually constant. The longitudinal compressive force will steadily increase until one of the evaluation criteria mentioned under point 4 is reached or exceeded. Until 280 kN it will not reach any evaluation criteria and so does not need to be increased. 
In order to determine the linear comparison, at least 20 tests shall be carried out for analysis, with different longitudinal compressive forces. On this occasion, the average longitudinal compressive force (2-axle goods wagons 200kN and bogie wagons 240kN) should be exceeded of about 10 % in at least 10 of the tests. 
In the course of the 20 tests, at 5 consecutive tests of the longitudinal compressive force must be carried out without changing the buffers or buffer plates maintenance. According to point 4, no evaluation criterion shall be exceeded.

S.1. DETERMINING THE BRAKING POWER OF VEHICLES FITTED WITH UIC AIR BRAKE FOR PASSENGER TRAINS. 
S.1.1. General 
The braked mass marked on a wagon shall indicate the braking power of this wagon in a 500 m long train that is braked in the P position. 
The braked mass of a train of wagons is in principle the sum of the braked mass painted on the vehicles with an active brake. 
This braked mass applies to hauled rakes that are ≤ 500 m long and braked in the P position. 
S.1.2. Determining the braking power by calculation 
S.1.2.1. Determining the braking power using the factor k 
The braked mass B of a wagon shall be determined by calculation providing the following conditions are met: 
- maximum speed ≤ 120 km/h, 
- the wheels are braked on both sides and have a nominal diameter of 920 to 1000 mm, 
- the brake shoes are made of P10 cast iron, 
- the blocks are type Bg (single) or Bgu (tandem), 
- force applied by the shoes 5 to 40 kN with Bg and 5 to 55 kN with Bgu blocks. 
The braked mass shall be calculated using the following formula: 
Equation (S1): Bt=k– × ΣFdyn kN9,81 m/s2 
where ΣFdyn is the sum of all the forces applied by the shoes whilst the vehicle is moving and k is a dimensionless factor that depends on the type of shoe (Bg or Bgu) and on the contact force of each shoe. 
ΣFdyn shall be calculated using the following formula: 
Where: 
Ft = Effective force at the brake cylinder [kN], once the recoil of thecylinders and of the rigging has been deducted 
i = Total increment for the brake rigging 
i* = The increment after the central rigging (normally 4 for two-axled wagons and 8 for bogie wagons) 
ηdyn = Mean efficiency of the rigging whilst the vehicle is moving (mean between two maintenance visits). ηdyn can be up to 0,91, depending on the type of rigging. 
FR = Opposing force applied from the regulator (usually 2 kN) 
The "k" curves used to calculate the braked mass are given by mathematical formulae of the following type: 
Equation (S2): k=a0 + a1 × Fdyn + a2 × F2dyn + a3 × F3dyn 
where: 
| a0 | a1 | a2 | a3 | 
kBg | 2,145 | -5,38 × 10-2 | 7,8 × 10-4 | -5,36 × 10-6 | 
kBgu | 2,137 | -5,14 × 10-2 | 8,32 × 10-4 | -6,04 × 10-6 | 
S.1.2.2. Wagons for which the required condition for calculating the braking power according to paragraph S.1.2.1 is not given. 
The calculation method described below shall be used to design the brake equipment of wagons with a maximum speed of ≤ 120 km/h. The braked mass that is painted on the wagon shall be determined in tests. 
The braked mass is usually calculated in the following two stages: 
1. Calculation of the braking distance based on the braking power applied in the various speed ranges. 
2. Determination of the braked mass percentage from the calculated braking distance using the assessment graph in Fig. S1 (wagon taken in isolation). 
Fig.S1 
Assessment graph 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
The braking distance shall be calculated step-by-step (chapter S.4.1) or by deceleration stages (chapter S.4.2) 
The calculation methods that are indicated apply in principle to a single wagon. 
The braking distance shall be calculated for each of the initial speeds given in chapter S.1.3.2 and for the load conditions in chapter S.1.3.2 taking into account: 
- the average dynamic efficiency between two maintenance visits, 
- a brake cylinder filling time of 4s, 
- the lowest mean friction characteristic for the friction materials on this type of wagon. 
Once the braking distances have been calculated the braked mass shall be pre-determined using the procedure from chapter S.1.3.2, but with the calculated braking distances instead of the mean braking distances measured in tests. 
For wagons as described in chapter S.1.2.1 that have a maximum speed of 140 km/h, the braked mass calculated for 120 km/h (cf. chapter S.1.2.1) may also be used for the maximum speed of 140 km/h. 
The braked mass may be pre-determined using this calculation procedure, taking into account the following additional points: 
- The braking distance shall be calculated for braking from 100, 120, 140 and 160 km/h up to the maximum speed of the wagon; 
- Once the braking distances have been calculated, the braked mass shall be pre-determined using the procedure from chapter S.1.3.2, but with the calculated braking distances instead of the mean braking distances measured in tests. 
The braked mass that is painted on the wagon shall be determined in tests (chapter S.1.3). 
S.1.3. Determining the braked mass in tests 
This procedure shall be obligatory wherever there is no approved calculation method. The procedure may also be carried out for wagons as described in chapter S.1.2.1 (P10 shoes). If the tests give a braked mass that is higher than the calculated value then the calculated value shall not be changed; if the tests give a braked mass that is lower than the calculated value, the reason for that result shall be determined. 
test may be carried out: 
- tests with a single vehicle 
In these tests the braking distance of the train or wagon shall be measured in an emergency brake application from v0 on straight and flat track. The braking distance shall be measured from the point where the emergency brake application was initiated. 
S.1.3.1. Wagons with a maximum speed of ≤ 120 km/h 
S.1.3.1.1. Tests on a single vehicle (slip brake tests) 
The vehicle in question shall be coupled to a locomotive and accelerated up to a speed of v0. Once that speed has been reached the mechanical coupler shall be uncoupled. An emergency brake application shall be made. The braking distance shall be measured from the point where the emergency brake application was initiated. 
S.1.3.1.2. Vehicle composition in the slip brake test 
- One wagon in the case of a basic bogie-wagon; 
- A group of three wagons in the case of two-axle wagons; 
- A group of two wagons in the case of articulated non-bogie wagons; 
- A set of wagons that cannot be split in service. 
The slip brake tests shall be carried out at 100 km/h and 120 km/h. 
Where an "empty-loaded" changeover device is present, slip brake tests shall be carried out: 
- in the "empty" position, around the transition load (providing this is possible with the vehicle type in question). In the case of an automatic "empty-loaded" changeover device, the tests shall also be carried out in the "empty" position around the transition load, but at a load that is far enough below the transition load for the automatic device to be stable in the "empty" position; 
- at maximum load, in the "loaded" position. 
In the case of vehicles with an automatic, continually operating load changeover device the slip brake tests shall be carried out: 
- in the empty state (tare mass), in the "empty" loading position, in order to check that the maximum λ value prescribed has not been exceeded 
- with the maximum load (which shall give the maximum braked mass). 
- Slip brake tests shall also be carried out to verify the braked mass at the point of maximum energy dissipation. 
The general test conditions can be found in chapter S.3.1. 
The measured distance shall be corrected for nominal test conditions (vo nom) using the method given in chapter S.3.2. 
From the mean braking distance s (mean of the permissible corrected values), the braked mass percentage of the vehicle shall be determined either from the 120 km/h and/or 100 km/h curves in fig. S1 or from the formula in table S1. The resulting minimum braked mass percentage shall be taken. 
Table S1 
Calculation of λ 
S = Cλ + D 
S = CS - D 
V [km/h] | C | D | 
100 | 52840 | 10 | 
120 | 83634 | 19 | 
140 | 119179 | 19 | 
160 | 161280 | 19 | 
These formulae are valid inside the limits corresponding to the extremities of the curves in Fig. S1. 
When the braked mass to be painted on the vehicle is determined in tests the test result shall be adjusted for the "mean" dynamic efficiency between two maintenance visits (0,83 for wagons as described in chapter S.1.2.1). 
With P10 shoes the braked mass shall be corrected for the dynamic power at the insert holder using the following method: 
a) Determine the efficiency of the brake rigging as accurately as possible whilst the vehicle is running in the test to determine ηdyn test. 
Where this measurement has not been taken, ηdyn test = 0,91 may be used for new wagons with conventional rigging. 
For other vehicles where ηdyn test has not been measured the following may be used: 
ηdyn test = 1 + ηstat test2 
This formula may not be applied for ηstat test values of less than 0,6. ηdyn test shall never be higher than 0,91. 
b) With Btest as the braked mass per insert holder in the test, the equations (1) and (2) above may be used to determine Fdyn test either by directly reading off the value. 
c) The corrected dynamic power is as follows: 
Fdyn corr = Fdyn test × 0,83ηdyn test 
d) With this value for Fdyn corr the same tables may be used to determine the corrected braked mass per insert holder, Bcorr. 
S.1.3.2. Wagons with a maximum speed greater than 120 km/h but not exceeding 160 km/h 
The method shall be identical to that set down in chapter S.1.3.1 with two additional series of tests, one from 140 km/h and the other from 160 km/h if the wagon is capable of running at 160 km/h. 
The measured braking distances shall be corrected for the nominal test conditions (Vo nom) using the method given in chapter S.3.2. 
The corrected mean braking distances shall be used to determine 4 values for λ (λ100, λ120, λ140, λ160) from the curves in fig. S1 (or from the formulae for these curves — see table S1). 
The minimum value shall be taken from λ100, λ120, λ140 and λ160. 
S.2. DETERMINING THE BRAKING POWER OF WAGONS FITTED WITH A UIC AIR BRAKE FOR FREIGHT TRAINS 
The braked mass of wagons in position G shall be deemed to be the same as the braked mass determined in position P. 
There shall be no separate assessment of the braking power of wagons in position G. 
S.3. EXECUTION OF TESTS 
S.3.1. Method of execution for the tests 
S.3.1.1. Atmospheric conditions 
In order to avoid bad atmospheric conditions affecting the results the tests shall be carried out with minimum wind and dry rail. 
S.3.1.2. Number of tests 
At least 4 valid tests shall be carried out from which the mean shall then be calculated. All the braking distances obtained shall be corrected according to point 1 of chapter S.3.2. 
The mean shall be accepted if it meets the following criteria, which shall be checked simultaneously: 
Criterion 1: Standard deviation of sample (σn)Mean of sample (s—) ≤ 3,0%and 
1. Criterion 2: Extreme value(se) – mean (s—) ≤ 1,95 × σn 
where se is the braking distance furthest from the mean. 
If one of the two criteria is not met, then a supplementary test shall be carried out (rejecting the extreme value "se" if criterion 2 is not met and n ≥ 5). 
With the new values thus obtained, criteria 1 and 2 shall then be checked where: 
si = the braking distance measured in test "i", after correction 
s— = the mean braking distance, 
n = the number of tests, 
σn = the standard deviation of the sample 
and 
The number of valid tests shall be at least 70 % of the total number of tests performed. The tests taken out in accordance with chapter S.3.2, Point 1b, shall not figure in the total number of tests. 
If after a total of 10 tests, one of the two criteria is not met, the test series shall be interrupted and the braking system controlled. The test interruption shall be recorded in the test report. 
S.3.1.3. Condition of friction components and discs/wheels 
Before starting the tests the vehicle's friction components (brake pads/shoes) shall be run in up to at least 70 % coverage. Shorter braking distances are obtained with 3 to 5 mm wear on cast iron brake shoes. If the tests include braking to a standstill in wet conditions, the leading edge of the pad/shoe shall be run-in in the direction of rotation. 
It is recommended that the tests be carried out on block-braked vehicles with wheels (either new or re-profiled) that have been run for at least 1200 km. 
It is recommended that the initial temperature of the discs/wheels be between 50 oC and 60 oC. 
S.3.2. Method of evaluating the test results 
S.3.2.1. Correcting the braking distances from each test 
The braking distance obtained in test "j" shall be corrected to take into account the following factors: 
- nominal speed in relation to the initial speed measured in the test; 
- gradient of the test track. 
The correction shall be made by applying the following formula: 
Transformation gives the following: 
where: 
sjcorr [m] = corrected braking distance (which corresponds to the nominal speed in test j); 
sjmeas [m] = braking distance measured in test j; 
vjnom [km/h] = nominal initial speed in test j; 
vjmeas [km/h] = initial speed measured in test j; 
ρ = coefficient of inertia of the "rotating masses", which is defined as follows: 
where: 
m = mass of the test train or vehicle, 
mr = equivalent mass of the rotating components. 
(Where no exact value is known ρ = 1,15 for locomotives and ρ = 1,04 for coaches shall be used.); 
i [mm/m] = mean gradient over sjmeas on the test track, which is positive (+) for an upgrade and negative (-) for a downgrade. 
The following two criteria shall be verified to validate the test: 
a) 3 mm/m (5 mm/m in exceptional cases) 
and 
b) vjmeas - vjnom ≤ 4 km/h 
S.3.2.2. Correcting the mean braking distance s— 
The mean braking distance s—, obtained in accordance with chapter S.3.1, shall be corrected to take into account the following factors: 
a) Dynamic efficiency of the brake rigging tested as compared with the mean in-service value and, for disc brakes, the mean wheel diameter on the vehicles tested as compared to the diameter of the half-worn wheel. For wagons with P10 block brakes and conventional brake rigging the dynamic efficiency shall be corrected using the method set out in S.1.3.1. 
The mean braking distance shall be corrected using the following formulae: 
Fcorr = Ftest × ηmηtest × dtestdm 
and 
s—corr = te × vnom + Ftest + WmFcorr + Wm × s— - vnom × te 
where: 
s—corr [m] = corrected mean braking distance; 
s— [m] = mean braking distance in the test; 
te [s] = equivalent build-up time for the braking power; 
Vnom [m/s] = nominal initial speed in the test; 
dtest [mm] = mean wheel diameter on the vehicles tested; 
dm [mm] = diameter of the half-worn wheel; 
Fcorr [kN] = corrected braking power; 
Ftest [kN] = mean braking power in the test; 
ηM = efficiency of the brake rigging in average service conditions; 
ηtest = efficiency of the brake rigging in the test; 
Wm [kN] = mean resistance to forward motion. 
b) Real filling time in relation to the nominal 4s. This correction shall only be applied to tests with a vehicle taken in isolation. 
The following correction formula shall be applied: 
s—corr = 2 - ts2 × Vnom + S— 
where: 
s—corr [m] = corrected mean braking distance; 
s— [m] = mean braking distance; 
ts [s] = measured mean filling time for the brake cylinders; 
Vnom [m/s] = nominal initial speed in the tests. 
S.4. Evaluation of brake performance by a calculation 
S.4.1. Step by step calculation 
The stop distance calculation can be performed step by step starting with general method based on dynamic equation; the algorithm is defined as follows : 
Step 1: | ΣFi + Wi = me × ai | 
with: 
ΣFi sum of retarding forces of all active brakes 
Wi retarding resistance at time i ; 
me Equivalent vehicle mass (including rotating masses); 
ai Deceleration at time i. 
Step 2: | ai = ΣFi + Wime | 
Step 3: | vI+1 = vi - ai × Δt | 
with: 
Δt Time calculation interval (Δt ≤ 1s); 
vi initial speed of interval Δt; 
vI+1 final speed of interval Δt; 
Step 4 : | Vmi = Vi + Vi+12 | 
with 
vmi mean speed in time interval Δt. 
Step 5 : | Δsi = vmi x Δt | 
with: 
Δsi running distance during interval Δt. 
The distance Δsi may be also calculated with one of the following formula : 
Step 5bis : | Δsj = vj × Δt - 12 × ai × Δt2 | 
Step 5ter : | Δsj = v2i - v2i+12 × ai | 
On the hypothesis where the brake force is constant on the interval, all the formulas give the same result. 
Step 6 : | s = Σ (vmi × Δt) | 
With: 
s s total stopping distance (down to v = 0) 
S.4.2. Calculation by stages of deceleration 
In the cases when the vehicles are equiped with brakes which established retarding forces are constant by stages in some speed intervals or if one know the mean of this force, the following simplified method is possible: 
Step 1 : | ami = ΣFmi + Wmime | 
with: 
Fmi , Wmi and ami constant values or mean in the speed interval vi à vi+1. 
Step 2 : | Δsj = v2i - v2i+12 ami | 
With: 
Δsi running distance in this speed interval 
Step 3 : | s = te × v o + ΣΔsi |

The following freight wagon gauges are available on lines in Great Britain: W6, W7, W8 and W9. The Infrastructure Manager shall list in the Infrastructure Register which gauge is available on a line. The gauges are described below in Section A –W6, Section B — Sample Calculation, Section C — W7 and W8, Section D — W9. Application of these gauges is limited to vehicles whose lateral suspension movement and sway is minimal. Vehicles with soft lateral suspension and/or large sway shall be evaluated dynamically according to Notified National Standards. 
Below 400 mm ARL, wagons shall comply with both reference profile and G1 and W6, taking whichever profile is more limiting in size.

Area above 1000 mm Above Rail Level (ARL) 
General 
This part of the gauge is to be considered static and the gauge width is unaffected by any lateral movements. 
1000 mm Dimension ARL 
The 1000 mm ARL dimension is an absolute minimum; no part of the wagon shall encroach vertically below this value such that the gauge is fouled, under whatever condition of loading or wear. Vertical spring travel shall be determined as the extreme movement to solid, or springstop condition. 
Determination of Maximum Vehicle Width. 
The 2820 mm dimension on straight track (equivalent to 3024 mm on curves with 200 m radius) is allowed without application of the width reduction formulae.

Ei = ANi - Ni2400 - 0,102 
b) Reduction Eo (Eo in metres to be made on each side of the gauge at a section situated beyond the axles or bogie centre: 
Eo = ANo + No2400 - 0,102 
Note 
- A negative value calculated from a) or b) above indicates that the reduction to be applied is nil. 
- No reduction is necessary at the centre of the vehicle unless the distance between bogie centres exceeds 12,8 m. 
- The width reduction formulae apply equally to all width co-ordinates of the upper profile. 
- No increase in the width of this gauge is permitted even if the displacements on the curve are less than described above. 
Area below 1000 mm ARL 
General 
This part of the gauge is simplified kinematic. 
Due account shall be taken of all lateral displacements, however caused, i.e.: 
(a) full lateral suspension travel, 
(b) full lateral suspension wear, 
(c) curve throw (Ei or Eo). 
The following shall not be included: 
(d) vehicle roll, 
(e) axleguard deflection, 
(f) wheel flange to rail clearance, 
(g) wheel flange and rail wear. 
All underclearance values shown are an absolute minimum; no part of the wagon must encroach vertically downwards such that the gauge is infringed under whatever condition of loading or wear. Vertical spring travel must be determined as the extreme movement to solid, or springstop condition. 
Additionally, under the foregoing conditions of full vertical deflection and wear, the vehicle must not infringe the gauge underclearances, relative to the 75, 100 and 135 mm ARL planes, when standing on a concave or convex vertical curve of 500 m radius. 
Determination of Maximum Vehicle Width 
At any point of the vehicle, the combination of its: 
(1) maximum static width, plus 
(2) the sum of values derived from 1.2.1 a), b) and c), 
shall not exceed any one of the four values shown below: 
Curve radius (R) | Maximum Width (1) + (2) | 
Straight| [1] | 2700 mm |

b) Reduction Eo (metres) to be made on each side of the gauge at a section situated beyond the axles or bogie centres.

T.1.3. Section B — Sample Calculation for a W6-A Gauge Vehicle 
1. Example 
1.1. Two-axle covered wagon, to the following dimensions: 
Wheelbase (A) | 9 m | 
Length over headstocks | 12,82 m | 
Full lateral suspension travel | ± 0,02 m | 
Full lateral suspension interface wear | 0,003 m | 
1.2. Area above 1000 mm ARL 
1.2.1. At centre of the vehicle 
Ei = ANi - Ni2400 
Ei = -0,051 m 
Ei is calculated as a negative value, hence no reduction is necessary. 
1.3. At vehicle headstock 
1.3.1. Ei = ANo + No2400 - 0,102 
Eo = -0,05 m 
Eo is calculated as a negative value, hence no reduction is necessary. 
1.4. Area below 1000 m ARL 
1.4.1. Total lateral suspension movements 
1.4.1.1. (0,020 + 0,003) m = 23 mm (half-width reduction) 
1.5. At axle centre line 
1.5.1. Eo/Ei = zero 
Therefore maximum width over axlebox components is: 
2700 - 2(23) = 2654 mm 
1.6. At centre of the vehicle 
1.6.1. Ei = ANi - Ni2R 
for R = 360 m | Ei = 28 mm | 
(i) Therefore maximum width at R = 360 m: 
2700 - 2(23) - 2(28) = 2598 mm 
for R = 200 m | Ei = 51 mm | 
(ii) Therefore maximum width at R = 200 m: 
2820 - 2(23) - 2(51) = 2672 mm 
for R = 160 m | Ei 63 mm | 
(iii) Therefore maximum width at R = 160 m: 
2900 - 2(23) - 2(63) = 2728 mm 
From the above it can be seen that case (i) produces the minimum value, and therefore the maximum permissible width at the centre of the vehicle is thus 2598 mm. 
1.7. At vehicle headstock 
1.7.1. Ei = ANo + No2R 
for R = 360 mm | Eo = 29 mm | 
(i) Therefore maximum width at R = 360 mm: 
2700 - 2(23) - 2(29) = 2596 mm 
for R = 200 m | Eo = 52 mm | 
(ii) Therefore maximum width at R = 200 m: 
2820 - 2(23) - 2(52) = 2670 mm 
For R = 160 m | Eo = 65 mm | 
(iii) Therefore maximum width at R = 160 m: 
2900 - 2(23) - 2(65) = 2724 mm 
From the above it can be seen that case (i) produces the minimum value, and therefore the maximum permissible width at the vehicle headstock is thus 2596 mm.

W9 (i) , this applies to load units situated between the bogie centres. [NB (i) denotes "inner"].

Container wagons have different positions for different sized Intermodal Units. These intermodal units loaded on container wagons are not fixed in position either laterally or longitudinally. All loading alignments and possible movement during journeys shall be taken into account for both W9 (i) and W9 (o). 
2. Notes on the reduction formulae and other factors to be considered in the application of Gauge W9 
2.1. Gauge W9 (i) is specified for a wagon with a bogie-centre distance of 13,5 m. No increase in the width of the gauge shall be permitted for wagons with a bogie-centre distance of less than 13,5 m but a reduction in the width of the gauge shall be made for wagons with a bogie-centre distance greater than 13,5 m.

2.1.1.1. General 
2.1.1.2. This part of gauge W9 (i) shall be considered as static and the gauge width is unaffected by lateral movements of the suspension up to a limiting value of 13 mm (including wear). 
The W9 (i) gauge width shall, be reduced in width, either side of the centre line, by an amount corresponding to the lateral movements of the suspension exceeding the limiting value of 13 mm. 
The 1000 mm area above rail level, at a width of 2796 mm, is an absolute minimum. No part of the load unit shall encroach vertically downwards such that the gauge is infringed under whatever condition of loading or wear. Vertical spring travel shall be determined as the extreme movement to solid, or springstop condition.

1.1.3. Reduction Ei (metres) to be made on each side of the gauge at a section between axles/bogies: 
Ei = ANi - Ni2400 - 0,114 
Note 
- A negative value calculated from the above Clause 1.1.3 indicates that the reduction to be applied is nil. 
- No reduction is necessary at the centre of the vehicle unless the distance between bogie centres exceeds 13,5 m. 
The width reduction formula applies equally to all width co-ordinates in the area exceeding 1000 mm ARL. 
Area between 1000 mm and 780 mm ARL

d) Load unit movement described in the introduction to Annex 5 Section D. 
The following shall not be included:

f) Axleguard deflection 
g) Wheel flange to rail clearance 
h) Wheel flange and rail wear 
2.1.3. Area below 780 mm ARL

Curve radius (R) | maximum width (i) + (ii) | 
360 m | 2810 mm | 
200 m | 2912 mm | 
160 m | 2970 mm | 
2.1.5.1. Reduction Ei (metres) to be made on each side of the gauge at a section between bogies: 
Ei = ANi - Ni2R 
2.1.6.2. Note: Any width reduction derived from the above applies equally to all width co-ordinates in the area between 1000 mm and 780 mm ARL. No increase in width of this gauge is permitted. 
3. Sample calculation 
3.1. Width reductions calculated in accordance with data relating to W9 (i) gauge. 
3.1.1. Bogie wagon, to the following dimensions: 
Distance between bogie centres (A) | 13,5 m | 
Length of loadable platform | 15,9 m | 
Full lateral suspension travel, including interface wear | 13 mm (i.e. not in excess of the standard value of 13 mm) | 
Full lateral movement of load unit in relation to securing device | 12,5 mm (i.e. 6,5 mm more than the standard value of 6 mm) | 
3.2. Area above 1000 mm ARL 
3.2.1. At the centre of the wagon 
Ei = ANi - Ni2400 - 0,114 
Ei = 13,5 × 6,75 - 6,752400 - 0,114 
Ei = -0,00009, i.e. no reduction due to curve overthrow. 
3.2.2. Overall gauge reduction 
= Ei + excess lateral suspension travel + excess load unit movement 
= 0 + 0 +6,5 mm. 
Therefore all horizontal co-ordinates of the W9 (i) gauge, in the area exceeding 1000 mm ARL, shall be reduced by 6,5 mm on each side of the gauge. 
3.3. Area comprised between 1000 mm and 780 mm ARL 
3.3.1. Total lateral suspension travel = 13 mm. 
Excess lateral travel of load unit = 6,5 mm. 
3.3.2. At centre of wagon: 
Ei = ANi - Ni22R 
For R = 360 m | Ei = 63 mm | 
(i) Therefore maximum width at R = 360 m will be: 
2810 - (2x63) - (2x13) - (2 x 6,5) = 2645 mm 
For R = 200 m | Ei = 114 mm | 
(ii) Therefore maximum width at R = 200 m will be: 
2912 - (2 x 114) - (2 x 13) - (2 x 6,5) = 2645 mm 
For R = 160 m | Ei 142 mm | 
(iii) Therefore maximum width at R = 160 m will be: 
2970 - (2 x 142) - (2 x 13) - (2 x 6,5) = 2647 mm 
The above cases (i) and (ii) both produce a minimum value and therefore the maximum permissible width of the load unit at the centre of the loadable deck length is thus 2645 mm. 
4. Notes on the reduction formulae and other factors to be considered in the application of Gauge W9 (o) 
4.1. Gauge W9 (o) is specified for a wagon with a distance of 13,5 m between bogie centres. No increase in gauge width is permitted for wagons with a distance of less than 13,5 m between bogie centres. However, a gauge reduction shall be applied for wagons with a distance greater than 13,5 m between bogie centres. 
4.1.1. Area above 1000 mm ARL 
4.1.1.1. General 
This part of gauge W9 (o) is to be considered as static and the gauge width is unaffected by lateral travel of the suspension up to a limiting value of 13 mm. 
However the W9 (o) gauge shall be reduced in width, either side of the centre line, by the amount by which the total lateral suspension travels exceeds the standard limiting value of 13 mm. 
Any load unit movement allowed by the restraining mechanisms e.g. spigots in excess of 6 mm laterally shall further reduce the width either side of the centreline. 
The area 1000 mm above rail level is an absolute minimum with a width of 2796 mm. No part of the load unit shall encroach vertically downwards such that the gauge is fouled under any condition of loading or wear. Vertical spring travel shall be determined as the extreme movement to solid, or springstop. 
A width of 2796 mm on straight track (equivalent to 3024 mm on curves of 200mm radius) shall be allowed without width reduction.

Eo = ANo + No2400 - 0,114 
4.1.3.2. Note 
- A negative value calculated indicates that nil reduction is necessary. 
- No reduction is necessary unless the distance to the end of the loadable decks exceeds 2,798 m for a wagon with bogie centres equal to 13,5m. 
The width reduction formula applies equally to all width co-ordinates in the area exceeding 1000 mm above rail ARL. 
Area ≤ 1000 mm ARL 
4.2.2. Area below 1000 mm ARL 
4.2.2.1. This part of the W9 (o) gauge is kinematic, and the gauge is to be determined precisely in accordance with the reference profile W6, except that the permitted widths must be further reduced dependent upon the load unit securing method. 
The area 1000 mm above rail level is an absolute minimum with a width of 2796 mm. No part of the load unit shall encroach vertically downwards such that the gauge is fouled under any condition of loading or wear. Vertical spring travel shall be determined as the extreme movement to solid, or springstop. 
4.2.2.2. Determination of gauge widths 
At any point of the vehicle, the combination of its: 
(i) maximum static width, plus 
(ii) the sum of values derived from 2.1.1 a), b), c) and d) 
shall not exceed any one of the three values shown below: 
Curve radius (R) | maximum width (i) + (ii) | 
360 m | 2710 mm | 
200 m | 2820 mm |

Width reductions calculated in accordance with data relating to the W9 (o) gauge 
Bogie wagon, to the following dimensions: 
Distance between bogie centre pins (A) | 13,5 m | 
Length of loadable platform | 15,9 m | 
Full lateral suspension travel, including interface wear | 13 mm (i.e. not in excess of the standard value of 13 mm) | 
Full lateral movement of load unit by reference to securing device | 12,5 mm (i.e. 6,5 mm more than the standard value of 6 mm) | 
Area above 1000 mm ARL 
At the end of the load unit 
Eo = ANo + No2400 - 0,114 where No = 15,9 - 13,52=1,2 
Eo = -0,070 m 
Total gauge reduction 
= Eo + excess lateral suspension travel + excess load unit movement 
= - 70 + 0 +6,5 = -63,5 mm, i.e. negative therefore no reduction needed. 
Area below 1000 mm ARL 
Total Lateral Suspension Travel = 13mm 
Excess Lateral Travel of Load Unit = 6,5 mm 
At the end of the load unit: 
Eo = ANo + No22R 
For R = 360 m | Eo = 24,5 mm | 
(i) Therefore maximum width at R = 360 m: 
2700 - (2 × 24,5) - (2 × 13) - (2 × 6,5) = 2612 mm 
For R = 200 m | Eo = 44 mm | 
(ii) Therefore maximum width at R = 200 m: 
2820 - (2 × 44) - (2 × 13) - (2 × 6,5) = 2693 mm 
For R = 160 m | Eo = 55 mm | 
(iii) Therefore maximum width at R = 160 m: 
2900 - (2 × 55) - (2 × 13) - (2 × 6,5) = 2751 mm 
Case (i) produces a minimum value, and therefore the maximum permissible width of the load unit at the end of the loadable deck length is thus 2612 mm.

ANNEX V 
SPECIFIC CASE 
Braking performance 
Great Britain 
V.1. Parking Brake for freight wagons intended for use on the Great Britain network 
Specification for parking brake: For new wagons used in the UK: every wagon has to be equipped. For wagons to be used solely in the UK, a parking brake shall be designed such that fully loaded wagons shall be held on a gradient of 2,5 % with a maximum of 10 % adhesion with no wind. 
V.2. Equivalent Brake Force %amp% Brake Force Factors for freight wagons intended for use on the Great Britain network 
Freight wagons operating in the UK shall have the equivalent brake force and, if applicable, any brake force factors calculated. Freight wagons operating in member states other than the UK shall have the brake weight/braked weight percentage calculated. Freight wagons required to operate in the UK and other member states shall have both equivalent brake force/brake force factors and brake weight/braked weight percentage calculated. The keeper shall be required to obtain this information and enter it into the Rolling Stock Register. 
Brake Force 
The force applied to the brake block/pad/braking surface interface. 
Equivalent Brake Force 
Is the value of brake force that needs to be exerted on an equivalent tread brake arrangement with a standard coefficient of friction, to produce the same value of brake retarding force as that given by the actual combination of brake force and coefficient of friction on the vehicle. 
Brake Force Factors 
These are factors that enable the UK TOPS computer system to calculate the brake force on a rail vehicle fitted with a device that varies the brake force in proportion to the vehicle mass. 
Calculation of Brake Force Data 
i) Vehicles with either a single value of brake force, or values fixed for the tare and laden conditions. 
The approach defined in this section shall also be used for coaching stock, even though they may have a brake force that varies with the vehicle load. The value of equivalent brake force calculated shall be that for the tare condition of the vehicle. 
The equivalent brake force is the total for the vehicle and is directly related to the vehicle brake retarding force acting at the rail. 
The declared value of brake force is used directly as an index of the braking ability of the vehicle and to be consistent with existing values, is the force that needs to be exerted on an equivalent tread brake arrangement to give the same brake retarding force at the rail, using a standard mean coefficient of friction at the friction braking interface. The standard mean coefficient of friction historically used, as the basis for the calculations, is 0,13. 
The equivalent brake forces as required above, must be calculated from the brake retarding force as follows: 
BT = FT0,13 × 9,81 | and | BL = FL0,13 × 9,81 | 
Where: 
BT = the equivalent brake force to be for the rail vehicle in tare condition (tonnes). 
BL = the equivalent brake force to be declared for the rail vehicle in laden condition (tonnes). 
FT %amp% FL = the vehicle brake retarding force, appropriate for the tare or laden condition respectively, that acts at the rail and over the period during which the brake cylinder pressure has reached at least 95 % of its maximum value (kN). 
0,13 = the standard mean coefficient of friction (-). 
9,81 = acceleration due to gravity (m/s2). 
ii) Vehicles with a value of brake force that varies in proportion to the load 
For those vehicles for which it is necessary to calculate brake force factors, that are in the form of a constant and a variable component, these shall be calculated as follows: 
(a) Brake force factor 1 = CL or CT (tonnes) 
where CL = BL - (m × WL) 
and CT = BT - (m × WT) 
See below for the derivation of m 
(b) Brake force factor 2 = BL - BTWL - WT = m (tonnes/tonne) 
Where 
BL = Equivalent brake force in max laden condition (tonnes). 
BT = Equivalent brake force in tare condition (tonnes) 
WL = Max laden mass (tonnes) 
WT = Tare mass (tonnes) 
The values of brake force factor calculated at (a) %amp% (b) above are to be recorded in the Rolling Stock Register. 
iii) Factors to be considered in the derivation of brake force 
The brake retarding force for a vehicle can be calculated from design data or derived from the results of braking distance tests, in either case this must be from the rail vehicle maximum speed. Where actual tests are undertaken, the value of equivalent brake force calculated must be validated. 
For tread braked vehicles, the brake retarding force is calculated from the product of the total value of the brake force and the coefficient of friction between the brake blocks and wheel tread. In the case of a disc brake, it is the product of the brake force, coefficient of friction and the ratio of effective radius at which the disc pad acts and the new wheel radius of the vehicle. 
When calculating brake retarding force, account must taken of any losses due to rigging efficiency, or slack adjusters within the brake force application system, between the brake cylinder and brake blocks or pads. If a reliable value for brake force cannot be derived, it should be measured directly at the block or pad. In this case account must be taken of the effects of vibration on the value of static friction in the rigging. 
The coefficient of friction used must take account of all influencing aspects, such as the brake force, the area of the friction material and vehicle speed, as all these factors affect the value of the coefficient of friction. For example, for a given brake block area, increasing block loads and speeds will reduce the effective value of the coefficient of friction for cast iron brake blocks. 
If there is no data available giving the coefficient of friction for particular combinations of load, speed and area of the friction interface, tests must be undertaken to establish a value, if it is used to calculate brake retarding force. 
Where there is one vehicle number to cover vehicles that are semi-permanently coupled by bar type couplers or are articulated, the correct brake retarding force must be calculated for each distributor by using the vehicle weight controlled by each distributor.

1.1. The vehicle gauge determines the space where the vehicle should be inside when it is in middle position on a straight track. The reference contour (FIN1) is given in Appendix A. 
1.2. To define the lowest position of the various parts of the vehicle (lower part, parts in the proximity of the flanges) in relation to the track, the displacements hereafter should be considered: 
- Maximum wears 
- Flexibility of suspensions up to the buffers. For grounds which will be made clear, the flexibility of springs has to be taken into account according to the ranking of the UIC Leaflet 505-1. 
- Static deflection of the frame 
- Mounting and construction tolerances 
1.3. For the definition of the highest location of the various parts of the vehicle, the vehicle is supposed empty, not worn and with mounting and construction tolerances. 
W.2. LOWER PART OF THE VEHICLE 
The minimum height allowed for the lower parts should be increased according to Appendix B1 for vehicles able to pass over marshalling yard humps and rail brakes. 
The vehicles not allowed passing over marshalling yard humps and rail brakes can have a minimum height increased according to Appendix B2. 
W.3. VEHICLE PARTS IN PROXIMITY OF THE WHEEL FLANGES 
3.1. The minimum vertical distance allowed for vehicle parts located in the vicinity of the wheel flanges, except the wheel themselves, is 55 mm from the running surface. In curves those parts should remain inside the zone occupied by the wheels. 
This distance of 55 mm does not apply to the flexible parts of the sanding system or to the flexible brushes.

Increase of the minimum height of the lower part of the vehicle able to pass over marshalling humps and rail brakes 
The height of the lower part of vehicles should be increased by Eas and Eau so that: 
- if the vehicle runs on the top of a hump, no part between bogie pivots or between end axles could penetrate the running surface of a hump the vertical curvature radius of which is 250 m; 
- if the vehicle runs in the concavity of the hump, no part beyond bogie pivots or beyond end axles could penetrate the gauge of rail brakes of a concavity the vertical curvature radius of which is 300 m. 
The formulae to [1] to calculate the height increase, are (values in metres): 
at a distance up to 1,445 m from the centreline of the track 
at a distance greater than 1,445 m from the centreline of the track 
Notations: 
Eas = height increase of the lower part of the vehicle in cross sections between bogie pivots or between end axles. Eas should not be taken into account unless its value is positive;

PASSING TRACKS: 
On the passing tracks of marshalling humps Rmin = 500 m, and the height of obstacle gauge above the running surface is h = 0 mm across the whole vehicle gauge width (= 1700 mm from track centreline). The longitudinal area where h = 0 spreads from the point of 20 m before the convex area on the top of the hump to the point of 20 m after the concave area at the valley of the hump. The obstacle gauge for the marshalling yard is valid outside this area (RAMO item 2.9 and RAMO 2 Annex 2, related to the gauge of marshalling yards, and also RAMO 2 Annex 5 related to the points of crossings). 
-------------------------------------------------- 
FIN1/Appendix C 
Reduction of the half-width according to the vehicle gauge FIN1, (reduction formulae) 
1. General rules 
The cross dimensions of the vehicles computed according to the vehicle gauge (Appendix A) should be decreased by the quantities Es or Eu, so that, when the vehicle is in its least favourable position (without inclination on its suspension) and on a track of radius R = 150 m, with a track gauge of 1,544 m, no part of the vehicle protrude the half-width of the vehicle gauge FIN1 by more than (36/R + k) from the track centreline. 
The centreline of the vehicle gauge coincides with the track centreline, this one being inclined if the track is canted. 
Reductions are calculated according to formulae given in chapter 2. 
2. Reduction formulae (in metres) 
2.1 Sections between bogie pivots or between end axles 
Es=an-n22R+p28R+l-d2+q+wiR-36R+k 
Es∞=l-d2+q+w∞-k 
2.2 Sections beyond bogie pivots or beyond end axles (vehicles with a overhang) 
Eu=an+n22R-p28R+l-d2+q2n+aa+wiRna+waRn+aa-36R+k 
Eu∞=l-d2+q+w∞2n+aa-k 
Notations: 
Es, Es ∞ = reduction of the gauge half-width for cross sections between bogie pivots or between end axles. Es and Es∞ should not be taken into account unless their values are positive; 
Eu , Eu∞ = reduction of the gauge half-width for cross sections beyond bogie pivots or beyond end axles. Eu and Eu∞ should not be taken into account unless their values are positive; 
a = distance between bogie pivots or between end axles [1]; 
n = distance between the cross section considered and the nearest bogie pivot, or the nearest end axle or the fictional pivot if the vehicle has no fixed pivot; 
p = bogie wheelbase; 
q = is the sum of the play between the axle box and the axle itself and of the possible play between the axle box and the bogie frame measured from the middle position with ultimately worn components; 
wiR = possible transverse displacement of the bogie pivot, and the cradle in relation to the bogie frame or, for vehicles without bogie pivot, possible displacement of the bogie frame in relation to the vehicle frame measured from the middle position towards the internal side of the curve (varies according to the curve radius); 
waR = comme wiR , but towards the outside of the curve; 
w∞ = as wiR , but on a straight track, from the middle position and towards both side; 
l = maximum track gauge in straight and in considered curved track = 1,544 m; 
d = distance between ultimately worn wheel flanges, measured 10 mm outwards the running circle = 1,492 m; 
R = curve radius; 
If w is constant or varies linearly according to 1/R, the radius to be considered is 150 m. 
In exceptional cases, the actual value of R ≥ 150 m should be used. 
k = allowable gauge protrusion (to be increased by the 36/R widening of obstacle gauge) without the inclination due to the suspension flexibility; 
= 0 for h %lt% 330 mm for vehicles able to run over rail brakes (see Appendix B1), 
= 0,060 m for h %lt% 600 mm, 
= 0,075 m for h ≥ 600 mm . 
h = height above the running surface at the considered location, the vehicle being in its lowest position. 
3. Reduction values 
The half-width of vehicle cross-sections should be decreased: 
3.1 For sections between bogie pivots; 
By the greater of values Es and Es∞ . 
3.2 For sections beyond bogie pivots; 
By the greater of values Eu and Eu∞. 
[1] If the vehicle has no actual bogie pivot, a and n should be determined on the base of a fictional pivot located at the intersection of the longitudinal centrelines of the bogie and of the frame, the vehicle being in middle position (0,026 + q + w = 0) on a curved track of radius 150 m. If the distance between the pivot calculated by this manner and the bogie centre point is denoted y, the term p2 should be replaced by p2 - y2 in reduction formulae.

FIN1/Appendix D1 
GAUGE OF THE VEHICLE LOWER STEP 
1. This norm concerns the step used either for high (550/1800) or for low platforms (265/1600). 
To avoid a uselessly wide gap between the step and the platform edge and taking account of the lower vehicle step and of high platforms (550/1800 mm), the value 1,700 - E can be exceeded in compliance with Appendix C, if a fixed step is concerned. In such a case, the calculations hereafter should be applied which allow checking that, in spite of the protrusion, the step will not reach the platform. The coach should be examined in its lowest position in relation to the running surface. 
2. Distance between the track centreline and the platform: 
3. Room required for the step : L=1,800+36R-t 
3.1 Step located between bogie pivots: As=B+an-n22R+p28R+l-d2+q+wiR

Au-B+an+n22R-p28R+l-d2+q2n+aa+wiRna+waRn+aa 
4. Notations (values in metres):

= 0,005 m (for controlled steps which for v ≤ 5 km/h unfurl automatically); 
l = maximum track gauge in straight and in considered curved track = 1,544 m; 
d = distance between ultimately worn wheel flanges, measured 10 mm outwards the running circle = 1,492 m; 
R = Curve radius =500 m …. ∞; 
t = allowed tolerance (0,020 m) for the displacement of the rail towards the platform between two maintenance actions. 
5. Rules related to the transverse distance between the step and the platform: 
5.1 Distance AV = L - As/u should be at least 0,020 m. 
5.2 On a straight track, with a coach in its middle position and a platform in its nominal location, a 150 mm distance between vehicle and platform is considered as sufficiently small. Anyway the smallest value should be sought for this distance. In the opposite case, the check is made on a straight and on a curved track where As/u is maximum. 
6. Gauge check 
Gauge check for the lower steps should be carried out on a straight track and on a 500 m curve, if value w is constant or varies linearly according to 1/R. Otherwise, the check should be carried out on a straight track and on curve where As/u is maximum. 
7. Display of the outputs 
Formulae used, inserted and resulting values should be displayed in an easily understood manner.

FIN1/Appendix D2 
Gauge of outwards opening doors and of opened steps for coaches and multiple units 
1. To avoid a uselessly wide gap between the step and the platform edge, the value 1,700 — E (see UIC Leaflet 560 § 1.1.4.2) can be exceeded in compliance with Appendix C, in the design of an outwards opening door with a step in open or closed position, or when the door and the step are moving between open and closed positions. In this case the checks hereafter should be carried out, among others to evidence that, in spite of the additional displacement, neither the door nor the step interfere with the fixed equipment (RAMO item 2.9 Annex 2). In the calculations the coach should be examined in its lowest position in relation to the running surface. 
Hereafter, the word door includes the step as well. 
NOTE: Appendix D2 may also be used to check the outer rear-view mirror of a loco and motor car the mirror being in open position. During normal line traffic the mirror is closed in a position recessed inside the body gauge. 
2. The distance between the track centreline and the fixed equipment is: L=AT+36R-t; 
AT = 1,800 m when h %lt% 600 mm, 
AT = 1,920 m when 600 %lt% h ≤ 1300 mm, 
AT = 2,000 m when h %gt% 1300 mm.

waR = as wiR , but towards the outside of the curve; 
wiR/aR = 0,020 m, maximum value for speeds less than 30 km/h (UIC 560); 
l = maximum track gauge in straight and in considered curved track = 1,544 m; 
d = distance between ultimately worn wheel flanges, measured 10mm outwards the running circle =1,492 m 
R = for h %lt% 600 mm, R = 500 m, 
for h ≥ 600 mm, R = 150 m. 
t = allowed tolerance (0,020 m) for the displacement of the rail towards the fixed equipment between two maintenance actions. 
5. Rules related to the transverse distance between the door and the fixed equipment: 
Distance OV = L - Os/u should be at least 0,020 m. 
6. Gauge check 
Door gauge check should be carried out on a straight track and on a 500/150-m curve, if value w varies linearly according to 1/R. Otherwise, the check should be carried out on a straight track and on curve where Os/u is maximum.

Z.1.3. Buffing test with laden wagons 
For this test, the wagon shall be loaded to its maximum capacity. The direction of impact shall be reversed after each buffing impact except in the case of tank wagons. Buffing impact tests need not be undertaken for conventional flat wagons. 
Z.1.4. Wagons with side buffers 
Preliminary tests are to be carried out with an increasing speed of impact. These preliminary tests shall be continued until one of two parameters (speed or force) attains the limiting values fixed in the following table . 
40 identical buffing impacts shall then be carried out with this limit in force. 
The preliminary tests and the series of buffing tests shall be conducted under the following conditions: 
Table Z1 
Limiting values | Preliminary tests | Test series | 
Force per buffer | Buffing speed | 
1500 kN [3] [4]. at a buffing speed ≤ 12 km/h | 12 km/h [5]. | 10 buffing impacts at progressively increasing speeds up to 12 km/h, three of which with a speed of approximately. 9 km/h. However, if an impact force per buffer of 1500 kN is attained at a speed %lt% 12 km/h, the speed shall not be increased above this value. | 40 buffing impacts at the limit speed defined during the preliminary tests, viz: either 12 km/h,or the speed corresponding to a buffing force of 1500 kN [5] [6] [7]. | 
Notes: 
Z.1.5. Wagons equipped with an automatic coupler 
The buffing speed of 12 km/h shall in all cases be obtained. 
Z.1.6. Results 
The different buffing tests shall not result in any visible permanent deformations. The stresses occurring at certain critical points of the bogie/underframe, underframe/body and superstructure connections shall be recorded. 
The results obtained shall satisfy the following conditions : 
- The cumulative residual strains arising from the preliminary test and from the series of 40 buffing impacts shall be less than 2 ‰ and shall be stabilised before the 30th impact of the series. This does not apply however to those structural components covered by special provisions. 
- The variations in leading dimensions shall not impair the quality of use of the wagon. 
[1] Recommendations concerning the type of buffer to be selected for different types of wagon are given in ERRI technical document DT 85 sheet B 3.0 
[2] Unless otherwise stated in the standard conditions and contract. In particular, with certain wagons, which are unacceptable for shunting on the gravity hump or for fly-shunting (i.e. type F-II), the buffing speed can be limited to 7 km/h. 
[3] The permissible tolerance on the buffer force at one end of the wagon is ± 200 kN, but the total force on both buffers shall not exceed 3000 kN. 
[4] If the wagon tested is equipped with buffers of category C, the limiting value of the buffer force can, subject to the agreement of the operator concerned, be reduced to 1300 kN (with a buffing speed %lt% 12 km/h) This does not apply to tank wagons intended for the transport of dangerous goods category 2 of the RID regulations. These are to be tested fitted with category A buffers. 
[5] If the value of the buffer force already reaches 1000 kN for a buffing speed %lt% 9 km/h, the wagon to be tested shall be equipped with higher capacity buffers. 
[6] If requested by the operator, buffing tests with a force above 1500 kN and a speed of up to 12 km/h can carried out at the end of the tests. 
[7] For wagons with hydrodynamic long-stroke shock absorbers the limiting value of the buffer force is reduced to 1000 kN.

5.3. The notified body chosen by the contracting entity must examine, if all stages of the subsystem as mentioned in point 5.2 are sufficiently and properly covered by the approval and surveillance of the quality management system(s) of the applicant(s) [20]. 
If the compliance of the subsystem with the requirements of the TSI is based on more than one quality management system, the notified body shall examine in particular, 
- if the relations and interfaces between the quality management systems are clearly documented 
and if overall responsibilities and powers of the management for the compliance of the whole entire subsystem for the main contractor are sufficiently and properly defined. 
5.4. The notified body referenced in point 5.1. must assess the quality management system to determine whether it satisfies the requirements of point 5.2. It presumes compliance with these requirements if the manufacturer implements a quality system for design, production, final product inspection and testing in respect of the Standard EN/ISO 9001 — 2000, which takes into consideration the specificity of the interoperability constituent for which it is implemented. 
When an applicant operates a certified quality management system, the notified body shall take this into account in the assessment.

- the quality records as foreseen by the manufacturing part (including assembly, installation and integration) of the quality management system, such as inspection reports and test data, calibration data, competency records of the personnel concerned, etc. 
6.3. The notified body must periodically carry out audits to make sure that the contracting entity, if involved, and the main contractors maintain and apply the quality management system and shall provide an audit report to them. When they operate a certified quality management system, the notified body shall take this into account in the surveillance. 
The frequency of the audits shall be at least once a year, with at least one audit during the time period of performing the relevant activities (design, manufacture, assembly or installation) for the subsystem being the subject of the EC verification procedure mentioned in point 7. 
6.4. Additionally the notified body may pay unexpected visits to the sites mentioned in point 5.2 of the applicant(s). At the time of such visits, the notified body may conduct complete or partial audits and may carry out or cause to be carried out tests in order to check the proper functioning of the quality management system where necessary. It must provide the applicant(s) with an inspection report and, audit and/or test reports as appropriate. 
6.5. The notified body chosen by the contracting entity and responsible for the EC verification, if not carrying out the surveillance of all the quality management system(s) concerned as under point 5, must co ordinate the surveillance activities of any other notified bodies responsible for that task, in order : 
- to be ensured that correct management of interfaces between the different quality management systems relating to subsystem integration has been performed. 
- to collect, in liaison with the contracting entity, the necessary elements for the assessment to guarantee the consistency and the overall supervision of the different quality management systems. 
This co ordination includes the right of the notified body 
- to receive all documentation (approval and surveillance), issued by the other notified body(s), 
- to witness the surveillance audits as in point 5.4., 
- to initiate additional audits as in point 5.5. under its responsibility and together with the other notified body(s). 
7. The notified body as referenced under point 5.1. must have entrance for inspection purposes, audit and surveillance to the locations of design, building sites, production workshops, locations of assembly and installation, storage areas and. where appropriate, prefabrication or testing facilities and, more general, to all premises which it considers necessary for its task, in accordance with the applicant's specific contribution to the subsystem project.

STRUCTURE AND MECHANICAL PARTS 
Sources of fatigue loading 
CC.1 PAYLOAD SPECTRUM 
CC.1.1 General 
Changes in payload are likely to cause significant fatigue load cycles. Where the payload changes significantly, the time spent at each load level shall be determined. Load/unload cycles should also be determined from the operator's specified duty and represented in a suitable manner for analysis purposes. Where applicable, account shall be taken of changes to the distribution of the payload and to the local pressure loads due to wheeled vehicles moving over the floor of the wagon. 
CC.1.2 Track induced loading 
Induced load cycles resulting from vertical, lateral and twist irregularities of the track shall be taken into account. These load cycles may be determined from: 
a) dynamic modelling; 
b) measured data; 
c) empirical data. 
It is permissible to base fatigue design on load case data and assessment methods proven in the application where this exist. Tables 15 and 16 of EN12663 give empirical data, in the form of wagon body accelerations consistent with normal European operations suitable for an endurance limit approach to fatigue design when normal established data is available. 
CC.1.3 Traction and braking 
Load cycles due to traction and braking shall reflect the number of start-stops (including unscheduled ones) associated with the intended mode of operation. 
CC.1.4 Aerodynamic loading 
Significant aerodynamic load input may arise due to: 
a) trains passing at speed; 
b) tunnel operation; 
c) cross winds. 
If such loading generates significant cyclic stresses in the structure it shall be included in the fatigue assessment. 
CC.1.5 Fatigue loads at interfaces 
The dynamic load used in design shall be in a range of +/- 30 % of the vertical static load. 
If this assumption is not chosen, then the following method shall be followed: 
The main fatigue loads at the body-bogie connection are due to: 
a) load/unload cycles; 
b) track input; 
c) traction and braking. 
The interface shall be designed to carry the cyclic loads due these inputs. 
Equipment attachments shall withstand the cyclic loads due to the motion of the wagon and any loads induced by the operation of the equipment. The accelerations may be determined as described above. For normal European operations, empirically derived accelerations for items of equipment that follow the motion of the wagon structure are given in tables 17, 18 and 19 of EN12663 and can be used where no more appropriate data is available. 
Cyclic loads in coupling components shall be taken into account if the experience of the operator or designer indicates they are significant.

ANNEX EE 
Structures and mechanical parts 
Footsteps and handrails 
EE.1 General 
Steps with corresponding handrails shall be provided at each location the staff stay in operation and where they are necessary to allow having access to parts of the wagon in operation. 
EE.2 Minimum Requirements 
EE.2.1 Handrails 
Handrails shall be of round bar steel 20 mm except for handrail specified in EE 2 with at least 30 mm in diameter. Handrails for shunters are specified in EE3 
The clearance between the handrails and the nearest obstructions shall be at least 120 mm. 
EE.2.2 Dimension of footsteps 
The steps at the end of the wagon, where the staff shall stay on, shall be 350 mm wide and 350 mm long, and shall be placed as defined in Fig EE1. The step shall be designed with a non-slip surface. These steps shall be fixed by means, which allow removable mounting of the footsteps (for instance by means of rivets or bolts fitted with a locked nut).

YY.1. INTRODUCTION 
This appendix provides the requirements for the design of wagon components and load restraint systems applicable to types of wagon in general use. The requirements shall be adopted only where they are appropriate to the intended application. 
YY.2. STRENGTH OF WAGON BODY STRUCTURES 
YY.2.1. Stresses due to the vertical load 
For the vertical load case, the loads on the vehicle must be distributed: 
- over a width of 2 m, 
- in the case of open bogie wagons and open bogie flat wagons, over a width of 1,2 m, 
- over the whole width of the floor, 
according to which gives the more unfavourable stresses in the underframe. 
The maximum deflection of the underframe under the applied load should not exceed 3 ‰ of the wheelbase or of the bogie pivot pitch from the initial position (including the effects of any counter-deflection). 
YY.2.2. Combined stresses 
For certain types of wagons, such as those with offset/depressed decks, it is particularly important to consider the combination of the stresses due to horizontal and vertical loading. 
Tank wagons designed for the transport of pressurised products must be designed to withstand, without sustaining residual damage, both the load corresponding to the maximum permissible load capacity and that resulting from the maximum working pressure (as defined by the RID) for which the tank has to be designed. 
YY.2.3. Strength of the wagon floor to support industrial trucks and road vehicles [1] . 
The wagon floor should be capable of withstanding the following loads without suffering any residual deformation: 
- By industrial trucks: 
- Simultaneous loading of each of the two front wheels of the truck with 30 kN; 
- Bearing surface of a wheel 220 cm2 for a width of about 150 mm; 
- Average mean distance between the front wheels of the industrial truck 650 mm. 
- By road vehicles (only with flat wagons and mixed open/flat wagons): 
- Loading with 65 kN per twin carrying wheel, 
- Bearing surface of a twin carrying wheel of 700 cm2 for a wheel width of about 200 mm. 
Note: Repetitive loads of this nature may need to be considered as fatigue load cases. 
YY.3. COVERED WAGONS WITH FIXED ROOF AND FIXED OR MOVING SIDE-WALLS AND COVERED WAGONS WITH SLIDING ROOFS 
YY.3.1. Strength of fixed side and end-walls 
At a height of 1 m above the floor the walls should sustain the forces defined below {acting from the inside out) .In the case of refrigerator vans, the characteristics of the material from which the inner skin and the insulation are made should be taken into account. There are four loading cases: 
a) transverse force applied to all side uprights; 
b) longitudinal force applied to all end posts; 
c) in the case of metal walls, transverse force acting on a point in the side-wall at the ventilation opening and along its centre-line; 
d) in the case of metal walls, longitudinal force acting along the centre-Iine of the end-wall. 
Load case | Minimum Design Load kN | Permissible Permanent Deformation — mm | 
a | 8 | 2 | 
b | 40 | 1 | 
c | 10 | 3 | 
d | 18 | 2 | 
For load cases c) and d) above the loaded area shall be 100 x 100 mm 
Note: Walls made of wooden panels should sustain the same loads as metal walls and the panels should be manufactured in a manner that ensures a consistent quality and performance. 
YY.3.2. Strength of side doors 
Sliding doors (single and two-leafed) 
Transverse loading 
The door(s) in closed position and locked, should sustain a horizontal normal force from the inside of the wagon outwards, representing the forces produced by a shift in the load as well as by pressure differences resulting from the high-speed passing of passenger trains in tunnels. This force is applied in the following conditions: 
a) at the centre of the door a force of 8kN applied over a 1x1 m area; 
b) at each connection/attachment point a force of 5 kN applied over 300x300 mm area. 
No permanent deformation or loss of functionality should occur, either on the door itself (wall and framework) or on the locking, sliding or guiding components as a result of these loads. 
YY.3.3. Strength of sliding walls 
The sliding walls, closed and locked, should resist a horizontal cross force applied from the inside of the wagon outwards. This force represents the forces produced by a shift of the load as well as by pressure differences resulting from the high-speed passing of passenger trains in tunnels. The load cases are as follows: 
a) Sliding walls which are less than 2,5 m long should meet the same load cases as sliding doors; 
b) Sliding walls from 2,5 m to 5 m long should have a 20 kN load applied at mid-wall over a 1x1 m area. 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
c) Sliding walls over 5 m %lt% 7 m long should have a 15 kN load applied in each case at a distance of 1/4 of the sliding wall length from the end of the sliding wall and at a height of 1 m over a 1x1 m area. 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
d) Sliding walls over 7 m long should have a 20 kN load applied in each case at a distance of 1/4 of the length of the sliding wall from the end of the sliding wall and at a height of 1 m over a 1x1 m area. 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
Plus the application of a 10 kN load on the lower flange of a sliding wall between two connection/attachment points immediately above floor level, over an area: 200 mm high by 300 mm wide. 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
YY.3.4. Forces resulting from the passing of trains 
Individual strength requirements for the outside connection/attachment points of the sliding wall (front surface over an area 200 mm high and 300 mm wide): 
a) with two-axled wagons and with bogie wagons with more than 2 sliding walls per side; force = 11,5 kN 
b) with bogie wagons with 2 sliding walls per side; force = 14 kN. 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
The point of application should be immediately above the floor and, in the roof area, as close as possible to the upper connection/attachment point. It is permissible for the upper load to be applied to the vertical section of the sliding wall. 
No permanent visible deformation or deterioration of the elements for closing, rolling and guiding the wall should result from the application of the above loads. It must be possible to move the panels without difficulty. A permanent deformation, equal at most to half the distance between the inner face of an opened wall and the maximum projecting point of a closed wall, is permissible. 
YY.3.5. Strength of lockable partitions of sliding-wall wagons 
When the partition is locked a force which corresponds to a buffing impact of 5 t at a speed of 13 km/h and which simulates the stresses produced by a paIletised load should be applied to a square surface area of 1x1 m , 600 m and 1100 mm above the top of the floor. The forces and deformation of the partition are to be measured. The deformation should not cause the partition to become detached or cause damage to the locking mechanism. 
A force of 50 kN should be applied to the seat of the lower lock over an area measuring 100 x 100 mm. There must be no damage and no permanent deformation as a result of the load. 
YY.3.6. Strength of roof 
The roof must be able to withstand a force of 1 kN applied from outside inwards to a surface area of 200 cm2 without any notable deformation. 
In addition, sliding roofs must withstand a vertical force from the inside outwards of 4,5 kN per connection/attachment point applied over a 300x300 mm square area. No deterioration or permanent deformation of the elements for closing, rolling and guiding the sliding roofs should result from this load. 
YY.4. Wagons with full opening roof (roller roof and hinged roof) 
YY.4.1. Wagons for the transport of heavy part-load goods 
Strength of side-walls 
The side-walls should withstand a total force of 30 kN applied at the 4 door pillars, 1,5 m above the floor. Where applicable, the elastic deformation of the upper wall member should be lower than the derailing limit of the roof. After removal of the load, the roof should be in perfect working order. 
Strength of side-wall door 
The standard door requirements, 3.2, should be met. 
Strength of roof 
Where it is foreseeable that a person might walk on it, the roof should withstand the weight of a person walking over it. It should be able to take a force of 1 kN at the most unfavourable point on an area of 300 x 300 mm. 
YY.4.2. Wagons for the transport of heavy bulk goods 
Strength of side-walls 
According to 4.1. 
Strength of side-wall door 
According to 3.2. 
Strength of roof 
According to 3.6. 
YY.5. High-sided open wagons 
YY.5.1. Resistance of side-walls to transverse forces and of the edges of side and end rails to impacts 
The following load cases apply, acting outwards in the horizontal direction at a level of 1,5 m above the floor: 
a) a force of 100 kN applied at four centre posts of each side-wall, as indicated below; 
b) a force of 40 kN applied at the corner posts of wagons equipped with drop ends; 
c) 25 kN at the middle of the upper side-wall rails; 
d) 60 kN at the middle of the upper rail of the end swing doors, for wagons equipped with these. 
Note: For the tests a) and b), the stipulated forces should be applied twice successively and only the deformations measured during the second load application should be taken into account. 
The permanent deformation at the point where the force is applied should not exceed 1 mm. In addition, the elastic deformation should not result in any encroachment of the loading gauge. 
Local deformation tests 
Denting tests should be performed on the upper rails of the side-walls by applying a vertical force of 40 kN, as indicated below. The permanent deformation at the point where the force is applied should not exceed 2 mm. 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
YY.5.2. Strength of the side doors 
A horizontal force of 20 kN should be applied at a the height of the door locking bar or 1 m above the floor and on the centre-line of the opening. The permanent deformation must not exceed 1 mm on the door itself, and no deterioration or permanent deformation of the bridges or closing elements should result. 
YY.6. FLAT WAGONS AND COMPOSITE FLAT/HIGH-SIDED WAGONS 
YY.6.1. Strength of the side and end flaps 
The requirement is to carry the load due to a lorry loaded to 65 kN per twin carrying wheel bearing on a total surface of 700 cm2 {width of wheel about 200 mm) on the flaps lowered onto the buffers or onto supports rigidly fastened to the buffer beam in the case of the end flaps, and onto a high platform in the case of the side flaps. 
No visible permanent deformation should result from the application of this load case. 
For the end flaps made of aluminum alloy, additional dynamic tests might be required. 
In addition to the above, the load cases and static tests shown below are also to be applied. 
End Flap 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
Side Wall Flap 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
YY.6.2. Strength of the fixed side-wall flaps 
The fixed side-wall flaps should be subjected to a force of 30 kN, applied over an area measuring about 350 x 200 mm at the edge, directed horizontally from inside the wagon towards the outside and applied at the middle of the side. 
YY.6.3. Strength of the side stanchions 
Pivoting or removable side stanchions should take the following loads: 
- An outward horizontal load of 35 kN acting at 500 mm from the centre of the bore-hole (swivelling Stanchion) 
- An outward horizontal load of 35 kN acting at 500 mm from the upper fixation flange (removable stanchion). 
YY.6.4. Strength of end stanchions 
Each end stanchion should take an outward horizontal load of 80 kN acting at 350 mm above the top surface of the floor. 
YY.7. Gravity discharge wagons 
YY.7.1. Strength of walls 
The walls should sustain the maximum permissible loads due to the goods they are intended to carry. 
YY.8. Wagons for the conveyance of ISO Containers and/or Swap-bodies 
YY.8.1. Attachment of containers and swap-bodies 
ISO containers and swap-bodies should be attached to rail vehicles using devices that engage with the load units’ ISO corner castings or corner plates. Devices currently used for this purpose include spigots and twistlocks. 
YY.8.2. Strength requirements for the container/swap-body retention devices 
The container/swap-body retention devices, their associated mountings and their attachment to the vehicle should be capable of withstanding the following accelerations, applied to the maximum gross container/swap-body mass.

STRUCTURES AND MECHANICAL PARTS 
Permissible Stress Based on Elongation Criteria 
ZZ.1. STRUCTURAL STEELS 
For structural steels, the margin of safety represented by factor S2 in clause 3.4.3 of EN12663:2000 can be determined from the material elongation at failure. The table below gives a reduced value for S2 and acceptable criteria using this approach that have been proven in service. 
| Material Property | Permissible stress | 
| Factor S2 | 
Parent Metal | R %lt% 0,8 Rm | S2 ≥1,25 | σc ≤ R | 
R %gt% 0,8 Rm; A %gt% 10 % | S2 %lt% 1,25 | σc ≤ R | 
R %gt% 0,8Rm; A %lt% 10 % | S2 ≥1,25 | σc ≤ Rm1,25 | 
Weld Metal | R %lt% 0,8 Rm | S2 ≥1,25 | σc ≤ R1,1 | 
R %gt% 0,8 Rm; A %gt% 10 % | S2 %lt% 1,25 | σc ≤ R1,1 | 
R %gt% 0,8 Rm; A %lt% 10 % | S2 ≥1,25 | σc ≤ Rm1,375 | 
Note: Notation is as in EN12663:2000; A = material elongation at failure. 
ZZ.2. OTHER STRUCTURAL MATERIALS 
For other structural materials, the permissible stress shall be the lower value of the material yield (or proof stress) and the material ultimate stress divided by factor S2 as defined in clause 3.4.3 of EN12663. S2 shall be taken as 1,5 unless the criteria given in the Euronorm permit a lower value.
