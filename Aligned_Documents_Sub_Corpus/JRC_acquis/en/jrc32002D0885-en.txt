Commission Decision 
of 7 November 2002 
amending Council Directive 96/49/EC as regards the time-limits within which pressure drums, cylinder racks and tanks for the transport of dangerous goods by rail must comply with it 
(notified under document number C(2002) 4343) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2002/885/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 96/49/EC of 23 July 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2001/6/EC(2), and in particular Article 6(4) third subparagraph thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The European standards laying down detailed technical specifications relating to the construction, use and conditions of carriage of pressure drums, cylinder racks and tanks for the transport of dangerous goods by rail have not yet been added to the Annex to Directive 96/49/EC, since standardisation of the CEN on them is not yet complete. 
(2) It is therefore necessary to defer the deadlines, fixed in Article 6(4) of Directive 96/49/EC, by which such pressure drums, cylinder racks and tanks must comply with Directive 96/49/EC. 
(3) Directive 96/49/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(4) In order to avoid any legal uncertainty this decision should apply from 1 July 2001, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
