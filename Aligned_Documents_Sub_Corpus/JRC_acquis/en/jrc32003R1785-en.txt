Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice 
Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 
of 29 September 2003 
on the common organisation of the market in rice 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 36 and the third subparagraph of 37(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the regions(3), 
Whereas: 
(1) The operation and development of the common market for agricultural products must be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy to include, in particular, a common organisation of agricultural markets which may take various forms depending on the product. 
(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(4) has been substantially amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, in the interests of clarity that Regulation should be replaced. Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 should accordingly be repealed. 
(3) The European rice market is in serious unbalance. The volume of rice stored in public intervention is very large, equivalent to about a quarter of Community output, and is likely to increase in the long run. The imbalance has been caused by the combined effect of an increase in domestic output, which has stabilised in recent marketing years, the continuing growth of imports and by the restrictions on exports with refunds in accordance with the Agriculture Agreement. The present imbalance is to be exacerbated even further and probably to reach an unsustainable level, in the course of the years to come as a result of increasing imports from third countries due to the implementation of the EBA Agreement. 
(4) This problem must be solved by revising the common market organisation for rice, in such a way as to take control of output, improve the equilibrium and fluidity of the market and enhance the competitiveness of Community agriculture, while pursuing the other aims of Article 33 of the Treaty, including maintaining suitable income support for producers. 
(5) It appears that the most suitable solution is to decrease strongly the intervention price and to create, as a compensation an income payment per farm and a crop specific aid reflecting the role of rice production in traditional production areas. The latter two instruments are incorporated in Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 on establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing support schemes for farmers(5). 
(6) To prevent the system of intervention becoming an outlet in itself, the quantities bought in by the intervention agencies should be limited to 75000 tonnes per year and the intervention period should be limited to four months. 
(7) The creation of a single Community market for rice involves the introduction of a trading system at the external frontiers of the Community. A trading system complementing the intervention system and including import duties applying the rates of the Common Customs Tariff and export refunds should, in principle, stabilise the Community market. The trading system should be based on the undertakings accepted under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. 
(8) In order to monitor the volume of trade in rice with third countries, provision should be made for an import and export licence scheme with the lodging of a security to ensure that the transactions for which such licences are requested are effected. 
(9) For the most part, the customs duties applicable to agricultural products under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements are laid down in the common customs tariff. However, for some rice products, the introduction of additional mechanisms makes it necessary to adopt derogations. 
(10) In order to prevent or counteract adverse effects on the Community market which could result from imports of certain agricultural products, imports of one or more of such products should be subject to payment of an additional import duty, if certain conditions are fulfilled. 
(11) It is appropriate, under certain conditions, to confer on the Commission the power to open and administer tariff quotas resulting from international agreements concluded in accordance with the Treaty or from other acts of the Council. 
(12) Provisions for granting a refund on exports to third countries, based on the difference between prices within the Community and on the world market, and falling within the limits set by the WTO Agreement on agriculture(6), should serve to safeguard Community participation in international trade in rice. Such export refunds should be subject to limits in terms of quantity and value. 
(13) Compliance with the limits in terms of value should be ensured at the time when export refunds are fixed through the monitoring of payments under the rules relating to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. Monitoring can be facilitated by the compulsory advance fixing of export refunds, while allowing the possibility, in the case of differentiated export refunds, of changing the specified destination within a geographical area to which a single export refund rate applies. In the case of a change of destination, the export refund applicable to the actual destination should be paid, with a ceiling of the amount applicable to the destination fixed in advance. 
(14) Ensuring compliance with the quantity limits requires the introduction of a reliable and effective system of monitoring. To that end, the granting of export refunds should be made subject to an export licence. Export refunds should be granted up to the limits available, depending on the particular situation of each product concerned. Exceptions to that rule can only be permitted in the case of processed products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty, to which volume limits do not apply, and in the case of food-aid operations which are exempt from any limitation. Provision should be made for derogating from strict compliance with management rules where exports benefiting from export refunds are not likely to exceed the quantity ceilings laid down. 
(15) To the extent necessary for its proper working, provision should be made for regulating or, when the situation on the market so requires, prohibiting the use of inward and outward processing arrangements. 
(16) The customs duty system makes it possible to dispense with all other protective measures at the external frontiers of the Community. The internal market and duty mechanism could, in exceptional circumstances, prove deficient. In such cases, in order not to leave the Community market without defence against disturbances that might ensue, the Community should be able to take all necessary measures without delay. All such measures should comply with the obligations arising from the WTO agreements. 
(17) Taking into account the influence of the world market price on the internal price, there should be provision for appropriate measures to be taken in order to stabilise the internal market. 
(18) The proper working of a single market based on common prices would be jeopardised by the granting of national aid. Therefore, the provisions of the Treaty governing State aid should apply to the products covered by this common market organisation. 
(19) In order to take account of the specific needs for supplies of the most remote regions of the Community and of the differences in prices of the products which can result from the costs of transport and of marketing of these products, it is advisable to make it possible for the Community to fix a subsidy for consignments from Member States being in one of the situations referred to in Article 23(2) of the Treaty, intended to be consumed in these regions and more particularly in the French overseas department of RÃ©union, 
(20) As the common market in rice is in continuous development, the Member States and the Commission should keep each other supplied with information relevant to these developments. 
(21) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7). 
(22) In view of the necessity to solve practical and specific problems, the Commission should be authorised to adopt necessary measures in cases of emergency. 
(23) Expenditure incurred by the Member States as a result of the obligations arising from the application of this Regulation should be financed by the Community in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(8). 
(24) The common organisation of the market in the rice sector should take proper and simultaneous account of the objectives set out in Articles 33 and 131 of the Treaty. 
(25) The change from the arrangements under Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 and Council Regulation (EC) No 3073/95 of 22 December 1995 determining the standard quality of rice(9) to those provided for in this Regulation could give rise to difficulties, which are not dealt with in this Regulation. In order to deal with such difficulties, the Commission should be enabled to adopt transitional measures. 
(26) In order to prevent a serious disturbance of the market in paddy rice in the last months of the marketing year 2003/2004, it is necessary to limit the intake by the intervention agencies to a certain quantity fixed in advance. 
(27) Provision should be made for the application of the new common market organisation,

3. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, no customs duty shall be levied on imports into the French overseas department of Reunion, intended for consumption there of products falling within CN code 1006 10, 1006 20 and 1006 40 00; 
4. Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 26(2). 
Article 12 
1. Without prejudice to Article 11(2), in order to prevent or counteract adverse effects on the market in the Community which may result from imports of certain products listed in Article 1, imports of one or more of such products at the rate of duty laid down in Article 11 shall be subject to the payment of an additional import duty if the conditions to be determined by the Commission pursuant to paragraph 3, are fulfilled, unless the imports are unlikely to disturb the Community market, or where the effects would be disproportionate to the intended objective. 
2. Imports made at a price below the level notified by the Community to the World Trade Organisation (%quot%the trigger price%quot%) may be subject to an additional import duty. 
If the volume of imports in any year in which the adverse effects referred to in paragraph 1 arise or are likely to arise exceeds a level based on market access opportunities defined as imports as a percentage of the corresponding domestic consumption during the three previous years (%quot%the trigger volume%quot%), an additional import duty may be imposed. 
The import prices to be taken into consideration for imposing an additional import duty pursuant to the first subparagraph, shall be determined on the basis of the cif import prices of the consignment under consideration. 
Cif import prices shall be checked to that end against the representative prices for the product on the world market or on the Community import market for that product. 
3. Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 26(2). Such detailed rules shall specify in particular the products to which additional import duties may be applied. 
Article 13 
1.

Other appropriate methods may be adopted. They must avoid any unjustified discrimination between the operators concerned. 
3. The method of administration adopted shall, where appropriate, give due weight to the supply requirements of the Community market and the need to safeguard the equilibrium of that market. 
4. The detailed rules referred to in paragraph 1 shall provide for the annual tariff quotas, if necessary suitably phased over the year, shall determine the administrative method to be used and, where appropriate, shall include: 
(a) guarantees covering the nature, provenance and origin of the product, 
(b) recognition of the document used for verifying the guarantees referred to in point (a),

To the extent necessary to enable the following products to be exported on the basis of quotations or prices for those products on the world market and within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty, the difference between those quotations or prices and prices in the Community may be covered by export refunds: 
(a) the products listed in Article 1 to be exported without further processing; 
(b) the products listed in Article 1 to be exported in the form of goods listed in Annex IV. 
Export refunds on the products referred to in point (b) may not be higher than those applicable to such products exported without further processing. 
2. The method to be adopted for the allocation of the quantities which may be exported with a refund shall be the method which: 
(a) is most suited to the nature of the product and the situation on the market in question, allowing the most efficient possible use of the resources available, account being taken of the efficiency and structure of Community exports without creating discrimination between large and small operators; 
(b) is least cumbersome administratively for operators, account being taken of administration requirements; 
(c) precludes discrimination between the operators concerned. 
3. Export refunds shall be the same for the whole Community. They may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary. Refunds shall be fixed in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 26(2). Refunds may be fixed: 
(a) at regular intervals; 
(b) by invitation to tender for products in respect of which provision was made for that procedure in the past. 
Export refunds fixed at regular intervals, may, if necessary, be amended in the interval by the Commission at the request of either a Member State or on its own initiative. 
4. The following shall be taken into account when refunds are being fixed: 
(a) the existing situation and future trends with regard to: 
(i) prices and availability of rice and broken rice on the Community market, 
(ii) prices of rice and broken rice on the world market; 
(b) the aims of the common organisation of the market in rice, which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market; 
(c) limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty; 
(d) the importance of avoiding disturbances on the Community market; 
(e) the economic aspects of the proposed exports;

1. Export refunds on products listed in Article 1 exported without further processing shall only be granted on application and on presentation of an export licence. 
2. The refund applicable to products listed in Article 1 exported without further processing shall be that applicable on the day of application for the licence and, in the case of a differentiated refund, that applicable on the same day: 
(a) for the destination indicated on the licence 
or, where appropriate 
(b) for the actual destination if it differs from the destination indicated on the licence. In that case the amount applicable may not exceed the amount applicable to the destination indicated on the licence. 
Appropriate measures may be taken to prevent any abuse of the flexibility provided for in this paragraph. 
3. The scope of paragraphs 1 and 2 may be extended to apply to products listed in Article 1 that are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex IV in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93(11). Detailed implementing rules shall be adopted in accordance with that procedure.

(b) the products have been exported from the Community; 
(c) in the case of a differentiated refund, have reached the destination indicated on the licence or another destination for which a refund was fixed, without prejudice to point (b) of paragraph 2. However, exceptions may be made to this rule in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 26(2), provided that conditions are laid down which offer equivalent guarantees. 
Additional provisions may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 26(2). 
2. No export refund shall be granted on rice imported from third countries and re-exported to third countries, unless the exporter submits proof that: 
(a) the product to be exported and the product previously imported are one and the same; and 
(b) the duties was collected when the goods were released for free circulation. 
In such cases the refund on each product shall be equal to the duties collected on importation where those duties are lower than the refund applicable. Where the duties collected on importation are higher than the refund applicable, those duties shall apply.

ANNEX I 
Definitions 
as referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 2(1) 
1. (a) Paddy rice: means rice which has retained its husk after threshing. 
(b) Husked rice: means paddy rice from which only the husk has been removed. Examples of rice falling within this definition are those with the commercial descriptions %quot%brown rice%quot%, %quot%cargo rice%quot%, %quot%loonzain%quot% and %quot%riso sbramato%quot%. 
(c) Semi-milled rice: means paddy rice from which the husk, part of the germ and the whole or part of the outer layers of the pericarp but not the inner layers have been removed. 
(d) Wholly milled rice: means paddy rice from which the husk, the whole of the outer and inner layers of the pericarp, the whole of the germ in the case of long grain or medium grain rice and at least part thereof in the case of round grain rice have been removed, but in which longitudinal white striations may remain on not more than 10 % of the grains. 
2. (a) Round grain rice: means rice, the grains of which are of a length not exceeding 5,2 mm and of a length/width ratio of less than 2. 
(b) Medium grain rice: means rice, the grains of which are of a length exceeding 5,2 mm but not exceeding 6,0 mm and of a length/width ratio no greater than 3. 
(c) Long grain rice: means 
(i) long grain rice A, rice, the grains of which are of a length exceeding 6,0 mm and of which the length/width ratio is greater than 2 but less than 3; 
(ii) long grain rice B, rice, the grains of which are of a length exceeding 6,0 mm and of which the length/width ratio is equal to or greater than 3. 
(d) Measurements of the grains: means grain measurements are taken on wholly milled rice by the following method: 
(i) take a sample representative of the batch; 
(ii) sieve the sample so as to retain only whole grains, including immature grains; 
(iii) carry out two measurements of 100 grains each and work out the average; 
(iv) express the result in millimetres, rounded off to one decimal place. 
3. Broken rice: means grain fragments the length of which does not exceed three quarters of the average length of the whole grain. 
ANNEX II 
Definition of grains and broken grains which are not of unimpaired quality 
as referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 2(1) 
A. Whole grains 
Grains from which only part of the end has been removed, irrespective of characteristics produced at each stage of milling. 
B. Clipped grains 
Grains from which the entire end has been removed. 
C. Broken grains or fragments 
Grains from which a part of the volume greater than the end has been removed; broken grains include: 
- large broken grains (pieces of grain of a length not less than half that of a grain, but not constituting a complete grain), 
- medium broken grains (pieces of grain of a length not less than a quarter of the length of a grain but which are smaller than the minimum size of %quot%large broken grains%quot%), 
- fine broken grains (pieces of grain less than a quarter of the size of a grain but too large to pass through a sieve with a mesh of 1,4 mm), 
- fragments (small pieces or particles of grain which can pass through a sieve with a mesh of 1,4 mm); split grains (pieces produced by a longitudinal split in the grain) come under this definition. 
D. Green grains 
Grains which are not fully ripened. 
E. Grains showing natural malformation 
Natural malformation means malformation, whether or not of hereditary origin, as compared with the morphological characteristics typical of the variety. 
F. Chalky grains 
Grains at least three-quarters of the surface of which looks opaque and chalky. 
G. Grains striated with red 
Grains showing longitudinal red striations of differing intensity and shades, due to residues from the pericarp. 
H. Spotted grains 
Grains showing a well-defined small circle of dark colour of more or less regular shape; spotted grains also include those which show slight black striations on the surface only; the striations and spots must not show a yellow or dark aureole. 
I. Stained grains 
Grains which have undergone, on a small area of their surface, an obvious change in their natural colour; the stains may be of different colours (blackish, reddish, brown); deep black striations are also to be regarded as stains. If the colour of the stains is sufficiently marked (black, pink, reddish-brown) to be immediately visible and if they cover an area not less than half that of the grain, the grains must be considered to be yellow grains. 
J. Yellow grains 
Grains which have undergone, totally or partially, otherwise than by drying, a change in their natural colour and have taken on a lemon or orange-yellow tone. 
K. Amber grains 
Grains which have undergone, otherwise than by drying, a slight uniform change in colour over the whole surface; this change alters the colour of the grains to a light amber-yellow. 
ANNEX III 
Definition of standard quality of paddy rice 
Paddy rice of standard quality shall: 
(a) be of a sound and fair marketable quality, free of odour; 
(b) contain a moisture content of maximum 13 %;
