Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of Singapore on certain aspects of air services 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
International aviation relations between Member States and third countries have traditionally been governed by bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries, the annexes to such agreements and other related bilateral or multilateral arrangements. 
Following the judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in cases C-466/98, C-467/98, C-468/98, C-471/98, C-472/98, C-475/98 and C-476/98, the Community has exclusive competence with respect to various aspects of external aviation. The Court of Justice also clarified the right of Community air carriers to benefit from the right of establishment within the Community, including the right to non-discriminatory market access. 
Traditional designation clauses in Member States’ bilateral air services agreements infringe Community law. They allow a third country to reject, withdraw or suspend the permissions or authorisations of an air carrier that has been designated by a Member State but that is not substantially owned and effectively controlled by that Member State or its nationals. This has been found to constitute discrimination against Community carriers established in the territory of a Member State but owned and controlled by nationals of other Member States. This is contrary to Article 43 of the Treaty which guarantees nationals of Member States who have exercised their freedom of establishment the same treatment in the host Member State as that accorded to nationals of that Member State. 
Following the Court of Justice judgements, the Council authorised the Commission in June 2003 to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with a Community agreement.[1] 
In accordance with the mechanisms and directives in the Annex to the Council decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with a Community agreement, the Commission has negotiated an agreement with Singapore that replaces certain provisions in the existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and Singapore. Article 2 of the Agreement replaces the traditional designation clauses with a Community designation clause, permitting all Community carriers to benefit from the right of establishment. Article 4 (Pricing) resolves conflicts between the existing bilateral air services agreements and Council Regulation No 2409/92 on fares and rates for air services which prohibits third country carriers from being price leaders on air services for carriage wholly within the Community. 
The Council is asked to approve the decisions on the signature and provisional application and on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of Singapore on certain aspects of air services and to designate the persons authorised to sign the agreement on behalf of the Community.

NOTING that the European Court of Justice has found that certain provisions of bilateral agreements entered into by several Member States with third countries are incompatible with Community law,

NOTING that the European Community has exclusive competence with respect to a number of aspects that may be included in bilateral air service agreements between Member States of the European Community and third countries, 
NOTING that, under European Community law, Community air carriers established in a Member State have the right to non-discriminatory access to air routes between that Member State and third countries,

RECOGNISING that consistency between European Community law and provisions of bilateral air service agreements between Member States of the European Community and Singapore will provide a viable means to ensure continuity and development of air services between the European Community and Singapore, 
NOTING that provisions of the bilateral air services agreements between Member States of the European Community and Singapore, which are not inconsistent with European Community law, do not need to be affected by this Agreement, 
NOTING that it is not a purpose of the European Community in this Agreement to increase the total volume of air traffic between the European Community and Singapore, to affect the balance between Community air carriers and air carriers of Singapore, or to prevail over the interpretation of the provisions of existing bilateral air service agreements concerning traffic rights, 
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

ARTICLE 2 
Designation, Authorisation and Revocation 
1. The provisions in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article shall prevail over the corresponding provisions in the articles listed in Annex 2 (a) and (b) respectively, in relation to the designation of air carriers by the Member State concerned, its authorisations and permissions granted by Singapore, and the refusal, revocation, suspension or limitation of the authorisations or permissions of the air carrier, respectively. 
2. The provisions in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article shall prevail over the corresponding provisions in the articles listed in Annex 2 (a) and (b) respectively, in relation to the designation of air carriers by Singapore, its authorisations and permissions granted by the Member State concerned, and the refusal, revocation, suspension or limitation of the authorisations or permissions of the air carrier, respectively. 
3. On receipt of such a designation, and of applications from the designated air carrier(s), in the form and manner prescribed for operating authorisations and technical permissions, each party shall, subject to paragraphs 4 and 5 grant the appropriate authorisations and permissions with minimum procedural delay, provided that: 
a) in the case of an air carrier designated by a Member State: 
i. the air carrier is established in the territory of the designating Member State under the Treaty establishing the European Community and has a valid Operating Licence from a Member State in accordance with European Community law; and 
ii. effective regulatory control of the air carrier is exercised and maintained by the Member State responsible for issuing its Air Operators Certificate and the relevant aeronautical authority is clearly identified in the designation; and 
iii.the air carrier has its principal place of business in the territory of the Member State from which it has received the valid Operating Licence ; and 
iv. the air carrier is owned directly or through majority ownership and is effectively controlled by Member States and/or nationals of Member States, and/or by other states listed in Annex 3 and/or nationals of such other states. 
b) in the case of an air carrier designated by Singapore: 
i. Singapore has and maintains effective regulatory control of the air carrier; and 
ii. it has its principal place of business in Singapore.

iv. the air carrier is not owned directly or through majority ownership and is not effectively controlled by Member States and/or nationals of Member States, and/or by other states listed in Annex 3 and/or nationals of such other states; or
