1. Are the words %quot%special investment funds%quot% in Article 13B(d)(6) of the Sixth Directive [1] capable of including closed-ended investment funds, such as ITCs? 
2. If the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, does the phrase %quot%as defined by Member States%quot% in Article 13B(d)(6): 
a. allow Member States to select certain of the %quot%special investment funds%quot% within their jurisdiction to benefit from the exemption of the supply of management services and exclude others from the exemption, or
