The Social Fund for Residential Recreation (SFV) has submitted an application to the ESF for a project called "Programme of upgrading for De Eemhof, 2003-2004") covered by the 2000 â&#x20AC;&#x201D; 2006 Single Programming Document. The project is being implemented in a recreational park called De Eemhof (near Zeewolde), which is part of Center Parcs Europe N.V. (CPE). 
The calibre of CPE's recreational services depends to a large extent on the calibre of its staff. They play a crucial role in the following spheres: improving the company's competitive position, innovation and growth, management of costs and quality, increasingly high expectations on the part of guests and staff, increasing emphasis on safety, working conditions and the environment, and, last but not least, the dynamic labour market. This calls for additional efforts to develop and invest in staff, the goal being competent, efficient and highly motivated staff who see the recreational sector as offering good prospects and come to view CPE as an employer which is prepared to invest in the future of its staff (preventing a high turnover by fostering staff loyalty). A high proportion of staff have low educational levels. New types of vocational training such as Levels 1 and 2 in Housekeeping, which can be taken on block or day release, will enable them to gain nationally accredited vocational qualifications. Other vocational qualifications and short courses train people for jobs in areas including catering, sales, call centres, and swimming pools, as well as for supervisory posts. Training is to be provided for about 1200 staff members
