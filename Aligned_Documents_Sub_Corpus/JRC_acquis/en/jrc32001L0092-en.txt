adapting to technical progress Council Directive 92/22/EEC on safety glazing and glazing materials on motor vehicles and their trailers and Council Directive 70/156/EEC relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(1), as last amended by European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/40/EC(2), and in particular Article 13(2) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Directive 92/22/EEC of 31 March 1992 on safety glazing and glazing materials on motor vehicles and their trailers(3), as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval procedure established by Directive 70/156/EEC. Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to Directive 92/22/EEC. 
(2) In order to standardise Community approval, it is necessary to introduce the information document provided for by Directive 70/156/EEC and to modify the approval certificate based on Annex VI thereto. 
(3) Furthermore, type-approval procedures should be simplified in order to maintain the choice, provided for in Article 9(2) of Directive 70/156/EEC, between certain separate directives and the corresponding regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE). As a first step, the technical requirements of Directive 92/22/EEC should be replaced by those of Regulation No 43 of the UN/ECE. 
(4) Directives 92/22/EEC and 70/156/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established under Directive 70/156/EEC,
