- introducing the UIC C1 gauge on new main lines and converting existing main lines to at least the B gauge (as agreed within AGTC, the Europe Agreement on important international combined transport links and related installations of 1 February 1991), if other means to reach interoperability of the networks are not attainable, 
- removing any bottlenecks on the road access routes to the combined transport terminals so as to enhance the use of combined transport;
