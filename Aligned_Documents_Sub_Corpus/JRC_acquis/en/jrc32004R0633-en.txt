Commission Regulation (EC) No 633/2004 
of 30 March 2004 
laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the poultrymeat sector 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in poultrymeat(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 493/2002(2), and in particular Articles 3(2), 8(12) and 15 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 of 22 December 1994 on the adjustments and transitional arrangements required in the agricultural sector in order to implement the agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1340/98(4), and in particular Article 3(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1372/95 of 16 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the poultrymeat sector(5) has been substantially amended several times(6). In the interest of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified. 
(2) Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 provides that all exports for which export refunds are requested, with the exception of exports of day-old chicks, shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence with advance fixing of the refund. Therefore specific implementing rules should be laid down for the poultrymeat sector which should, in particular, include provisions for the submission of the applications and the information which must appear on the applications and licences, in addition to those contained in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 325/2003(8). 
(3) In order to assure proper administration of the system, the rate of the security for export licences under the said system should be fixed. In view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in the poultrymeat sector, export licences should not be transferable and precise conditions governing access by traders to the said system should be laid down. It is necessary for particular conditions of access in the case of export licences for certain traditional markets in order to limit speculative applications which could put at risk the production which is specifically destined for those markets for a transitional period. 
(4) Article 8(11) of Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 provides that compliance with the obligations arising from agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations regarding the export volume shall be ensured on the basis of the export licences. Therefore a detailed schedule for the lodging of applications and for the issuing of licences should be laid down. 
(5) In addition, the decision regarding applications for export licences should be communicated only after a period of consideration. This period would allow the Commission to appreciate the quantities applied for as well as the expenditure involved and, if appropriate, to take specific measures applicable in particular to the applications which are pending. It is in the interest of traders to allow the licence application to be withdrawn after the acceptance coefficient has been fixed. 
(6) In the case of applications concerning quantities equal to or less than 25 tonnes, the export licence should be issued immediately if the trader requests it. However, such licences should be restricted to short-term commercial transactions in order to prevent the mechanism provided for in this Regulation from being circumvented. 
(7) In order to ensure an exact follow up of the quantities to be exported, a derogation from the rules regarding the tolerances laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should be laid down. 
(8) The Commission should dispose of precise information concerning applications for licences and of the use of licences issued, in order to be able to manage this system. In the interests of efficient administration, the notifications from Member States to the Commission should be made according to a uniform model. 
(9) Article 8(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 provides that for day-old chicks export refunds may be granted on the basis of an ex post export licence. Therefore implementing rules for such a system should be laid down with the aim of ensuring efficient verification that the obligations arising from the agreements concluded in the framework of the Uruguay Round negotiations are complied with. However, it would appear unnecessary to require the lodging of a security in the case of licences applied for after exportation. 
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
All exports of products in the poultrymeat sector for which an export refund is requested, with the exception of chicks falling within CN codes 0105 11, 0105 12 and 0105 19, shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence with advance fixing of the refund, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 to 8.
