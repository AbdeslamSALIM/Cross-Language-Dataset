THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy [1], and in particular Article 26(4) thereof,

(2) On 28 February 2006 France notified the Commission, pursuant to Article 21(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93, that it would close the fishery for herring in the waters of ICES zone IVc, VIId for vessels flying its flag, with effect from 1 March 2006.

(4) According to the information received by the Commission from the French authorities, a quantity of herring is still available in the French quota for ICES zone IVc, VIId. Consequently, fishing for herring in these waters by vessels flying the flag of France or registered in France should be authorised. 
(5) This authorisation should take effect on 19 October 2006, in order to allow the quantity of herring in question to be finished before the end of the current year.
