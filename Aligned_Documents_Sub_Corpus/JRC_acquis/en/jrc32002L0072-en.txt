Commission Directive 2002/72/EC 
of 6 August 2002 
relating to plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 89/109/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs(1), and in particular Article 3 thereof, 
After consulting the Scientific Committee on Food, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Directive 90/128/EEC of 23 February 1990 relating to plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs(2), as last amended by Directive 2002/17/EC(3), has been frequently and substantially amended; for reasons of clarity and rationality, it should therefore be consolidated. 
(2) Article 2 of Directive 89/109/EEC lays down that materials and articles, in their finished state, must not transfer their constituents to foodstuffs in quantities which could endanger human health or bring about an unacceptable change in the composition of the foodstuffs. 
(3) In order to achieve this objective in the case of plastic materials and articles, a suitable instrument is a specific Directive within the meaning of Article 3 of Directive 89/109/EEC, the general provisions of which are also applicable to the case in question. 
(4) The scope of this Directive must coincide with that of Council Directive 82/711/EEC(4). 
(5) Since the rules established in this Directive are not suitable for ion-exchange resins, these materials and articles will be covered by a subsequent specific Directive. 
(6) Silicones should be regarded as elastomeric materials rather than plastic materials and therefore should be excluded from the definition of plastic. 
(7) The establishment of a list of approved substances accompanied by a limit on overall migration and, where necessary, by other specific restrictions will be sufficient to achieve the objective laid down in Article 2 of Directive 89/109/EEC. 
(8) Besides the monomers and other starting substances fully evaluated and authorised at Community level, there are also monomers and starting substances evaluated and authorised in at least one Member State which may continue to be used pending their evaluation by the Scientific Committee on Food and the decision on their inclusion in the Community list; this Directive will accordingly be extended in due course to the substances and sectors provisionally excluded. 
(9) The current list of additives is an incomplete list inasmuch as it does not contain all the substances which are currently accepted in one or more Member States; accordingly, these substances continue to be regulated by national laws pending a decision on inclusion in the Community list. 
(10) This Directive establishes specifications for only a few substances. The other substances, which may require specifications, therefore remain regulated in this respect by national laws pending a decision at Community level. 
(11) For certain additives the restrictions established in this Directive cannot yet be applied in all situations pending the collection and evaluation of all the data needed for a better estimation of the exposure of the consumer in some specific situations; therefore, these additives appear in a list other than that of the additives fully regulated at Community level. 
(12) Directive 82/711/EEC lays down the basic rules necessary for testing migration of the constituents of plastic materials and articles and Council Directive 85/572/EEC(5) establishes the list of simulants to be used in the migration tests. 
(13) The determination of a quantity of a substance in a finished material or article is simpler than the determination of its specific migration level. The verification of compliance through the determination of quantity rather than specific migration level should therefore be permitted under certain conditions. 
(14) For certain types of plastics the availability of generally recognised diffusion models based on experimental data allows the estimation of the migration level of a substance under certain conditions, therefore avoiding complex, costly and time-consuming testing. 
(15) The overall migration limit is a measure of the inertness of the material and prevents an unacceptable change in the composition of the foodstuffs, and, moreover, reduces the need for a large number of specific migration limits or other restrictions, thus giving effective control. 
(16) Council Directive 78/142/EEC(6) lays down limits for the quantity of vinyl chloride present in plastic materials and articles prepared with this substance and for the quantity of vinyl chloride released by these materials and articles, and Commission Directives 80/766/EEC(7) and 81/432/EEC(8) establish the Community methods of analysis for controlling these limits. 
(17) In view of potential liability, there is a need for the written declaration provided for in Article 6(5) of Directive 89/109/EEC whenever professional use is made of plastic materials and articles which are not by their nature clearly intended for food use. 
(18) Commission Directive 80/590/EEC(9) determines the symbol that may accompany any material and article intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. 
(19) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of ensuring the free movement of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs, to lay down rules on the definition of plastics and permitted substances. This Directive confines itself to what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty. 
(20) In accordance with Article 3 of Directive 89/109/EEC, the Scientific Committee on Food has been consulted on the provisions liable to affect public health. 
(21) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. 
(22) This Directive should be without prejudice to the deadlines set out in Annex VII, Part B within which the Member States are to comply with Directive 90/128/EEC, and the acts amending it, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

4. This Directive shall not apply, until further action by the Commission, to materials and articles composed of two or more layers, one or more of which does not consist exclusively of plastics, even if the one intended to come into direct contact with foodstuffs does consist exclusively of plastics. 
Article 2 
Plastic materials and articles shall not transfer their constituents to foodstuffs in quantities exceeding 10 milligrams per square decimetre of surface area of material or article (mg/dm2) (overall migration limit). However, this limit shall be 60 milligrams of the constituents released per kilogram of foodstuff (mg/kg) in the following cases: 
(a) articles which are containers or are comparable to containers or which can be filled, with a capacity of not less than 500 millilitres (ml) and not more than 10 litres (l); 
(b) articles which can be filled and for which it is impracticable to estimate the surface area in contact with foodstuffs; 
(c) caps, gaskets, stoppers or similar devices for sealing. 
Article 3 
1. Only those monomers and other starting substances listed in Annex II, Sections A and B, may be used for the manufacture of plastic materials and articles subject to the restrictions specified. 
2. By way of derogation from the first paragraph the monomers and other starting substances listed in Annex II, Section B, may continue to be used until 31 December 2004 at latest, pending their evaluation by the Scientific Committee on Food. 
3. The list in Annex II, Section A, may be amended: 
- either by adding substances listed in Annex II, Section B, according to the criteria in Annex II of Directive 89/109/EEC, or 
- by including %quot%new substances%quot%, i.e. substances which are listed neither in Section A nor in Section B of Annex II, according to Article 3 of Directive 89/109/EEC. 
4. No Member State shall authorise any new substance for use within its territory except under the procedure in Article 4 of Directive 89/109/EEC. 
5. The lists appearing in Annex II, Sections A and B, do not yet include monomers and other starting substances used only in the manufacture of:

- epoxy resins, 
- adhesives and adhesion promoters, 
- printing inks. 
Article 4 
An incomplete list of additives, which may be used for the manufacture of plastic materials and articles, together with the restrictions and/or specifications on their use, is set out in Annex III, Sections A and B. 
For the substances in Annex III, Section B, the specific migration limits are applied as from 1 January 2004 when the verification of compliance is carried out in simulant D or in test media of substitute tests as laid down in Directives 82/711/EEC and 85/572/EEC. 
Article 5 
Only the products obtained by means of bacterial fermentation listed in Annex IV may be used in contact with foodstuffs. 
Article 6 
1. General specifications related to plastic materials and articles are laid down in Annex V, Part A. Other specifications related to some substances appearing in Annexes II, III and IV are laid down in Annex V, Part B.

(a) articles which are containers or are comparable to containers or which can be filled, with a capacity of less than 500 ml or more than 10 l; 
(b) sheet, film or other materials which cannot be filled of for which it is impracticable to estimate the relationship between the surface area of such materials and the quantity of foodstuffs in contact therewith. 
In these cases, the limits set out in Annex II, expressed in mg/kg shall be divided by the conventional conversion factor of 6 in order to express them in mg/dm2. 
Article 8 
1. Verification of compliance with the migration limits shall be carried out in accordance with the rules laid down in Directives 82/711/EEC and 85/572/EEC and the further provisions set out in Annex I. 
2. The verification of compliance with the specific migration limits provided for in paragraph 1 shall not be compulsory, if it can be established that compliance with the overall migration limit laid down in Article 2 implies that the specific migration limits are not exceeded. 
3. The verification of compliance with the specific migration limits provided for in paragraph 1 shall not be compulsory, if it can be established that, by assuming complete migration of the residual substance in the material or article, it cannot exceed the specific limit of migration. 
4. The verification of compliance with the specific migration limits provided for in paragraph 1 may be ensured by the determination of the quantity of a substance in the finished material or article provided that a relationship between that quantity and the value of the specific migration of the substance has been established either by an adequate experimentation or by the application of generally recognised diffusion models based on scientific evidence. To demonstrate the non-compliance of a material or article, confirmation of the estimated migration value by experimental testing is obligatory. 
Article 9 
1. At the marketing stages other than the retail stages, the plastic materials and articles which are intended to be placed in contact with foodstuffs shall be accompanied by a written declaration in accordance with Article 6(5) of Directive 89/109/EEC. 
2. Paragraph 1 does not apply to plastic materials and articles, which by their nature are clearly intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. 
Article 10

ANNEX I 
FURTHER PROVISIONS APPLICABLE WHEN CHECKING COMPLIANCE WITH THE MIGRATION LIMITS 
General provisions 
1. When comparing the results of the migration tests specified in the Annex to Directive 82/711/EEC, the specific gravity of all the simulants should conventionally be assumed to 1. Milligrams of substance(s) released per litre of simulant (mg/l) will thus correspond numerically to milligrams of substance(s) released per kilogram of simulant and, taking into account the provisions laid down in Directive 85/572/EEC, to milligrams of substance(s) released per kilogram of foodstuff. 
2. Where the migration tests are carried out on samples taken from the material or article or on samples manufactured for the purpose, and the quantities of foodstuff or simulant placed in contact with the sample differ from those employed in the actual conditions under which the material or article is used, the results obtained should be corrected by applying the following formula: 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2002220EN.002202.TIF%quot%%gt% 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
3. The determination of migration is carried out on the material or article or, if that is impracticable, using either specimens taken from the material or article or, where appropriate, specimens representative of this material or article. 
The sample shall be placed in contact with the foodstuff or simulant in a manner representing the contact conditions in actual use. For this purpose, the test shall be performed in such a way that only those parts of the sample intended to come into contact with foodstuffs in actual use will be in contact with the foodstuff or simulant. This condition is particularly important in the case of materials and articles comprising several layers, for closures, etc. 
The migration testing of caps, gaskets, stoppers or similar devices for sealing must be carried out on these articles by applying them to the containers for which they are intended in a manner which corresponds to the conditions of closing in normal or foreseeable use. 
It shall in all cases be permissible to demonstrate compliance with migration limits by the use of a more severe test. 
4. In accordance with the provisions set out in Article 8 of the present Directive, the sample of the material or article is placed in contact with the foodstuff or appropriate simulant for a period and at a temperature which are chosen by reference to the contact conditions in actual use, in accordance with the rules laid down in Directives 82/711/EEC and 85/572/EEC. At the end of the prescribed time, the analytical determination of the total quantity of substances (overall migration) and/or the specific quantity of one or more substances (specific migration) released by the sample is carried out on the foodstuff or simulant. 
5. Where a material or article is intended to come into repeated contact with foodstuffs, the migration test(s) shall be carried out three times on a single sample in accordance with the conditions laid down in Directive 82/711/EEC using another sample of the food or simulant(s) on each occasion. Its compliance shall be checked on the basis of the level of the migration found in the third test. However, if there is conclusive proof that the level of the migration does not increase in the second and third tests and if the migration limit(s) is (are) not exceeded on the first test, no further test is necessary. 
Special provisions relating to overall migration 
6. If the aqueous simulants specified in Directives 82/711/EEC and 85/572/EEC are used, the analytical determination of the total quantity of substances released by the sample may be carried out by evaporation of the simulant and weighing of the residue. 
If rectified olive oil or any of its substitutes is used, the procedure given below may be followed. 
The sample of the material or article is weighed before and after contact with the simulant. The simulant absorbed by the sample is extracted and determined quantitatively. The quantity of simulant found is subtracted from the weight of the sample measured after contact with the simulant. The difference between the initial and corrected final weights represents the overall migration of the sample examined. 
Where a material or article is intended to come into repeated contact with foodstuffs and it is technically impossible to carry out the test described in paragraph 5, modifications to that test are acceptable, provided that they enable the level of migration occurring during the third test to be determined. One of these possible modifications is described below. 
The test is carried out on three identical samples of the material or article. One of these shall be subjected to the appropriate test and the overall migration determined (M1). The second and third samples shall be subjected to the same conditions of temperature but the period of contact shall be two and three times that specified and overall migration determined in each case (M2 and M3, respectively). 
The material or article shall be deemed to be in compliance provided that either M1 or M3 - M2 do not exceed the overall migration limit. 
7. A material or article that exceeds the overall migration limit by an amount not greater than the analytical tolerance mentioned below should therefore be deemed to be in compliance with this Directive. 
The following analytical tolerances have been observed: 
- 20 mg/kg or 3 mg/dm2 in migration tests using rectified olive oil or substitutes, 
- 12 mg/kg or 2 mg/dm2 in migration tests using the other simulants referred to in Directives 82/711/EEC and 85/572/EEC. 
8. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 3(2) of Directive 82/711/EEC, migration tests using rectified olive oil or substitutes shall not be carried out to check compliance with the overall migration limit in cases where there is conclusive proof that the specified analytical method is inadequate from a technical standpoint. 
In any such case, for substances exempt from specific migration limits or other restrictions in the list provided in Annex II, a generic specific migration limit of 60 mg/kg or 10 mg/dm2, according to the case, is applied. However, the sum of all specific migrations determined shall not exceed the overall migration limit.
