THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

It is appropriate to extend the simplified procedures to the provisions on benefits in respect of accidents at work and occupational diseases contained in Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 [4] and (EEC) No 574/72 [5]. 
(2) In order to take account of changes in the legislation of certain Member States, in particular in the new Member States since the end of accession negotiations, the Annexes to Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 need to be adapted. 
(3) Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 and (EEC) No 574/72 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(4) In order to ensure legal certainty and to protect the legitimate expectations of persons affected, it is necessary to provide that certain provisions modifying Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 take effect retroactively from 1 May 2004. 
(5) The Treaty does not provide powers other than those under Article 308 to take appropriate measures within the field of social security for persons other than employed persons,
