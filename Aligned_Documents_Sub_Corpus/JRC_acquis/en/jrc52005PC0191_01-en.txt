COUNCIL DECISION

Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the conclusion of the Additional Protocol to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey following the enlargement of the European Union 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
Ten new Member States acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004. Under Article 6(2) of the Act of Accession 2003, the new Member States have undertaken to accede to, amongst others, the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey. Article 6(2) of the Act of Accession provides for a simplified procedure, namely the conclusion of a protocol by the Council, acting unanimously on behalf of the Member States, and the third country concerned. This procedure is without prejudice to the Community’s own competences and does not affect the allocation of powers between the Community and the Member States. 
These proposals also respect the conclusions of the December 2004 European Council relating to the signature of such a protocol. 
The Commission has negotiated this Additional Protocol on the basis of negotiation directives adopted by the Council on 9 March 2004. 
The attached proposals are for (1) a Council Decision on the signature of the Additional Protocol and (2) a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Additional Protocol. 
Article 1 (1) of the Additional Protocol takes account of incomplete past ratification procedures with regard to previous accessions of six Member States. Even though these earlier procedures were not completed, there has nevertheless been a de facto and de jure association between these states and Turkey. This is made clear in the second “considering” of the additional protocol. 
The Additional Protocol provides for the necessary technical adaptations of the Association Agreement that ensue from the accession of the new contracting parties. The Additional Protocol includes a number of adjustments brought about by the institutional and legal developments within the EC, as well as by the accession of the new Member States to this mixed agreement and an increase in the number of official languages. 
The Commission requests the Council to adopt the attached proposals for Council Decisions on the signature and on the conclusion of the Additional Protocol. The European Parliament will be called upon to give its assent to the conclusion of this Additional Protocol.

TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS 
Article 9 
Proof of status under the provisions on free circulation for industrial products 
1. Proofs of origin properly issued by either Turkey or a new Member State in the framework of preferential trade agreements applied between them and allowing with the Community a cumulation of origin based on identical rules of origin and a prohibition of any drawback or suspension from customs duties on the goods concerned, shall be accepted in the respective countries as a proof of status under the provisions on free circulation for industrial products, laid down in Decision No 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995, provided that: 
(a) the proof of origin and the transport documents were issued no later than 30 April 2004;

Where goods were declared for importation in either Turkey or a new Member State, prior to 1 May 2004, in the framework of preferential trade agreements mentioned above, proof of origin issued retrospectively under those agreements may also be accepted provided that it is submitted to the customs authorities at the latest on 31 August 2004. 
2. Requests for subsequent verification of proof of origin referred to in paragraph 1 above shall be accepted by the competent customs authorities of either Turkey or the new Member States for a period of three years after the issue of the proof of origin concerned and may be made by those authorities for a period of three years after acceptance of the proof of origin submitted to those authorities in support of an import declaration.

Proof of origin and administrative cooperation under the provisions of preferential agreements on coal and steel products and agricultural products [?] 
1. Proofs of origin properly issued by either Turkey or a new Member State in the framework of preferential agreements applied between them for products other than those referred to in Article 9, shall be accepted in the respective countries provided that: 
(a) the acquisition of such origin confers preferential tariff treatment on the basis of the preferential tariff measures contained in either the Agreement on coal and steel products or the Decision on agricultural products; 
(b) the proof of origin and the transport documents were issued no later than 30 April 2004; 
(c) the proof of origin is submitted to the customs authorities within the period of four months from 1 May 2004. 
Where goods were declared for importation in either Turkey or a new Member State, prior to 1 May 2004, under preferential agreements applied between Turkey and that new Member State at that time, proof of origin issued retrospectively under those agreements or arrangements may also be accepted provided that it is submitted to the customs authorities at the latest on 31 August 2004. 
2. Turkey and the new Member States are authorised to retain the authorisations with which the status of “approved exporters” has been granted in the framework of preferential agreements applied between them, provided that:

(b) the approved exporter applies the rules of origin in force under that agreement provided for either in Protocol 1 to the Agreement on coal and steel products or in Protocol 3 to the Decision on agricultural products. 
These authorisations shall be replaced no later than one year after the date of accession, by new authorisations issued under the conditions of either Protocol 1 to the Agreement on coal and steel products or Protocol 3 to the Decision on agricultural products. 
3. Requests for subsequent verification of proof of origin issued under the preferential agreements referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above shall be accepted by the competent customs authorities of either Turkey or the Member States for a period of three years after the issue of the proof of origin concerned and may be made by those authorities for a period of three years after acceptance of the proof of origin submitted to those authorities in support of an import declaration.

2. Provisions on free circulation for industrial products shall be applied or preferential tariff treatment shall be granted in such cases, subject to the submission to the customs authorities of the importing country, within four months of the date of accession, of either a proof of status or a proof of origin issued retrospectively by the customs authorities of the exporting country.
