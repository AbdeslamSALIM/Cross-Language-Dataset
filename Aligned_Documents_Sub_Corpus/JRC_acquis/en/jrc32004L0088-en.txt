After consulting the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-food Products intended for Consumers, 
Whereas: 
(1) As the risk assessment had not been completed in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) 793/93 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances(2), the period of inclusion in part 2 of Annex III to Directive 76/768/EEC for musk xylene and musk ketone was extended until 30 September 2004 . 
(2) On 8 January 2004 , the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment adopted an opinion on the results of the risk assessment of musk xylene and musk ketone that was carried out in accordance with Regulation (EEC) 793/93. 
(3) The Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-food Products intended for Consumers (SCCNFP) has confirmed that musk xylene can be safely used in cosmetic products, excluding oral care products, up to a maximum concentration in the final product of 1 % in fine fragrance, 0,4 % in eau de toilette and 0,03 % in other products and that musk ketone can be safely used in cosmetic products, excluding oral care products, up to a maximum concentration in the final product of 1,4 % in fine fragrance, 0,56 % in eau de toilette and 0,042 % in other products. 
(4) It is therefore necessary to include musk xylene and musk ketone in part 1 of Annex III to Directive 76/768/EEC while the corresponding entries in part 2 of that Annex should be deleted. 
(5) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
