Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC (1), as last amended by Directive 96/43/EC (2), and in particular Article 18 (7) thereof,

Whereas the presence of Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever has been confirmed in South Africa; 
Whereas Commission Decision 96/659/EC (4) prohibited the importation of live ratites, and meat of ratites from South Africa until the situation was clarified; 
Whereas new scientific research has permitted the risk relating to the importation of live ratites and meat of ratites to be clarified; whereas Commission Decision 96/659/EC can now be amended to take account of the knowledge gained;

'ANNEX I 
RATITE MEAT 
The competent authority shall ensure that the ratites are isolated in rodent-proof, tick-free surroundings for at least 14 days prior to slaughter. 
Before moving to the tick-free surroundings, the birds shall either be examined to verify that they are tick-free or treated to ensure that all ticks on them are destroyed. The treatment used must be specified on the import certificate. Any treatment used shall not result in any detectable residues in the ratite meat. 
Each batch of ratites shall be examined for ticks prior to slaughter. If any are detected, the entire batch shall again be subjected to the pre-slaughter isolation. 
ANNEX II 
LIVE RATITES 
The competent authority shall ensure that the ratites are isolated in rodent-proof, tick-free surroundings for at least 21 days prior to export. 
Before moving to the tick free surroundings, the birds shall be treated to ensure that all ectoparasites on them are destroyed. After 14 days in tick-free surroundings the ratites shall be subjected to the competitive ELISA test for antibodies to Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever. Each and every animal entering the isolation must give a negative result to the test. On arrival in the Community, the treatment for ectoparasites and the serological test shall be repeated.`
