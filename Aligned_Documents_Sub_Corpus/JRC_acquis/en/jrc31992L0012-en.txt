Council Directive 92/12/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/12/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 99 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1) , 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2) , 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3) , 
Whereas the establishment and functioning of the internal market require the free movement of goods, including those subject ot excise duties; 
Whereas provision should be made to define the territory on which this Directive, as well as the Directive on the rates and structures of duty on products subject to excise duties, are to be applied; 
Whereas the concept of products subject to excise duty should be defined; whereas only goods which are treated as such in all the Member States may be the subject of Community provisions; whereas such products may be subject to other indirect taxes for specific purposes; whereas the maintenance or introduction of other indirect taxes must not give rise to border-crossing formalities; 
Whereas, in order to ensure the establishment and functioning of the internal market, chargeability of excise duties should be identical in all the Member States; 
Whereas any delivery, holding with a view to delivery or supply for the purposes of a trader carrying out an economic activity independently or for the purposes of a body governed by public law, taking place in a Member State other than that in which the product is released for consumption gives rise to chargeability of the excise duty in that other Member State; 
Whereas in the case of products subject to excise duty acquired by private individuals for their own use and transported by them, the duty must be charged in the country where they were acquired; 
Whereas to establish that products subject to excise duty are not held for private but for commercial purposes, Member States must take account of a number of criteria; 
Whereas products subject to excise duty purchased by persons who are not approved warehousekeepers or registered or non-registered traders and dispatched or transported directly or indirectly by the vendor or on his behalf must be subject to excise duty in the Member State of destination; 
Whereas in order to ensure that the tax debt is eventually collected it should be possible for checks to be carried out in production and storage facilities; whereas a system of warehouses, subject to authorization by the competent authorities, should make it possible to carry out such checks; 
Whereas movement from the territory of one Member State to that of another may not give rise to checks liable to impede free movement within the Community; whereas for the purposes of chargeability it is nevertheless necessary to know of the movements of products subject to excise duty; whereas provision should therefore be made for an accompanying document for such products; 
Whereas the requirements to be complied with by authorized warehousekeepers and traders without authorized warehousekeeper status should be laid down; 
Whereas provision should be made, to ensure the collection of taxes at the rates laid down by Member States, for the establishment of a procedure for the movement of such goods unter duty suspension; 
Whereas in that respect provision should first be made for each consignment to be easily identified; whereas provision should be made for the tax status of the consignment to be immediately identifiable; whereas it is therefore necessary to provide for an accompanying document capable of meeting these needs, which may be either an administrative or commercial document; whereas the commercial document used must contain the essential elements which appear on the administrative document; 
Whereas the procedure by which the tax authorities of the Member States are informed by traders of deliveries dispatched or received by means of an accompanying document should be explained; 
Whereas there is no need for the accompanying document to be used when the products subject to excise duties are moved under a Community customs procedure other than release for free circulation or are placed in a free zone or a free warehouse; 
Whereas in the context of national provisions, excise duty should, in the event of an offence or irregularity, be collected in principle by the Member State on whose territory the offence or irregularity has been committed, or by the Member State where the offence or irregularity was ascertained, or, in the event of non-presentation in the Member State of destination, by the Member State of departure; 
Whereas the Member States may provide that products released for consumption should carry fiscal or national identification marks and whereas the use of these marks should not place any obstacle in the way of intra-Community trade; 
Whereas payment of the excise duties in the Member State where the products were released for consumption must give rise to the reimbursement of those duties when the products are not intended for consumption in that Member State; 
Whereas, as a result of the abolition of the principle of taxes on imports in relations between Member States, the provisions on exemptions and allowances on imports cease to apply in respect of relations between Member States; whereas these provisions should therefore be abolished and the directives concerned adapted accordingly; 
Whereas a Committee on Excise Duties should be set up to examine the Community measures necessary for the implementation of the provisions on excise duties; 
Whereas Article 1 (2) of the Regulation concerning the elimination of controls and formalities applicable to the cabin and hold baggage of persons taking an intra-Community flight or making an intra-Community sea-crossing states that its enforcement is without prejudice to controls relating to bans or restrictions laid down by Member States, provided that they are compatible with the three Treaties establishing the European Community; whereas in that context the verifications necessary for the enforcement of the quantitative restrictions referred to in Article 26 must be considered to be such controls and, as such, to be compatible with Community legislation; 
Whereas a certain period of time will be required to take the necessary measures to alleviate both the social repercussions in the sectors concerned and regional difficulties, particularly in border regions, which might arise as a result of the abolition of taxes on imports and exemptions on exports in trade between the Member States; whereas to that end the Member States should be authorized, for a period ending on 30 June 1999, to exempt products supplied, within the limits laid down, by tax-free shops in the context of passenger traffic by air or sea between the Member States: 
Whereas small wine producers may be exempted from certain requirements under the general arrangements for excise duty; 
Whereas, finally, Council Directive 77/799/EEC of 19 December 1977 concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation and value addes tax(4) should be amended in order to extend its provisions to cover excise duties, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

To that end, without prejudice to Article 6, where products already released for consumption as defined in Article 6 in one Member State are delivered, intended for delivery or used in another Member State for the purposes of a trader carrying out an economic activity independently or for the purposes of a body governed by public law, excise duty shall become chargeable in that other Member State. 
3.

Article 9 
1. Without prejudice to Articles 6, 7 and 8, excise duty shall become chargeable where products for consumption in a Member State are held for commercial purpose in another Member State. 
In this case, the duty shall be due in the Member State in whose territory the products are and shall become chargeable to the holder of the products. 
2. To establish that the products referred to in Article 8 are intended for commercial purposes, Member States must take account, inter alia, of the following:

Article 10 
1.

For the purposes of this Article, 'Member State of destination' shall mean the Member State of arrival of the dispatch or transport. 
2. To that end, the delivery of products subject to excise duty already released for consumption in a Member State and giving rise to the dispatch or transport of those products to a person as referred to in paragraph 1, established in another Member State, and which are dispatched or transported directly or indirectly by the vendor or on his behalf shall cause excise duty to be chargeable on those products in the Member State of destination. 
3. The duty of the Member State of destination shall be chargeable to the vendor at the time of delivery. However, Member States may adopt provisions stipulating that the excise duty shall be payable by a tax representative, other than the consignee of the products. Such tax representative must be established in the Member State of destination and approved by the tax authorities of that Member State. 
The Member State in which the vendor is established must ensure that he complies with the following requirements:

They shall also be exempt, under suspension arrangements, in respect of losses inherent in the nature of the products during production and processing, storage and transport. Each Member State shall lay down the conditions under which these exemptions are granted. These exemptions shall apply equally to the traders referred to in Article 16 during the transport of products under excise duty suspension arrangements. 
2. Losses referred to in paragraph 1 occuring during the intra-Community transport of products under excise duty suspension arrangements must be established according to the rules of the Member State of destination.

The risks inherent in intra-Community movement shall be covered by the guarantee provided by the authorized warehousekeeper of dispatch, as provided for in Article 13, or if need be, by a guarantee jointly and severally binding both the consignor and the transporter. If appropriate, Member States may require the consignee to provide a guarantee. 
The detailed rules for the guarantee shall be laid down by the Member States. The guarantee must be valid throughout the Community. 
4. Without prejudice to the provision of Article 20, the liability of the authorized warehousekeeper of dispatch and, if the case arises, that of the transporter may only be discharged by proof that the consignee has taken delivery of the products, in particular by the accompanying document referred to in Article 18 under the conditions laid down in Article 19.

(d) consent to all monitoring and stock checks. 
For this type of trader excise duty shall be chargeable at the time of receipt of the goods and shall be paid in accordance with the procedure laid down by each Member State.

(b) pay the excise duty of the Member State of destination at the time of receipt of the goods in accordance with the procedure laid down by that Member State; 
(c) consent to any check enabling the administration of the Member State of destination to satisfy itself that the goods have actually been received and that the excise duty to which they are liable has been paid.

This document may be either an administrative document or a commercial document. The form and content of this document shall be established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 24 of this Directive. 
2. In order to identify the goods and conduct checks, the packages should be numbered and the products described using the document referred to in paragraph 1. If need be, each container should be sealed by the consignor when the means of transport is recognized as suitable for sealing by the Member States of departure or the packages should be sealed by the consignor. 
3. In cases where the consignee is not an authorized warehousekeeper or a registered trader and notwithstanding Article 17, the document referred to in paragraph 1 must be accompanied by a document certifying that excise duty has been paid in the Member State of destination or that any other procedure for collection of duty has been complied with in accordance with the conditions laid down by the competent authorities of the Member State of destination. 
This document must give: 
- the address of the office concerned of the tax authorities in the Member State of destination,

The procedure to be followed with respect to the copy for the competent authorities of the Member States of destination shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 24. 
2. When products subject to excise duty move under the duty-suspension arrangements to an authorized warehousekeeper or to a registered or non-registered trader, a copy of the accompanying administrative document or a copy of the commercial document, duly annotated, shall be returned by the consignee to the consignor for discharge, at the latest within 15 days following the month of receipt by the consignee. 
The copy to be returned must contain the following details which are required for discharge: 
(a) the address of the office of the tax authority for the consignee; 
(b) the date and place of receipt of the goods; 
(c) a description of the goods received in order to check whether the consignment tallies with the details contained in the document. If it does, the note 'consignment checked' must be added;

4. Where the products subject to excise duty which are moving under the duty-suspension arrangement as defined in Article 4 (c) are exported, this arrangement should be discharged by an attestation drawn up by the customs office of departure from the Community confirming that the product has indeed left the Community. That office must send back to the consignor the certified copy of the accompanying document intended for him. 
5. If there is no discharge, the consignor shall inform the tax authorities of his Member State wihtin a time limit to be fixed by those tax authorities. The time limit may not, however, exceed three months from the date of dispatch of the goods. 
6. Member States shall cooperate to introduce spot checks which may be conducted, as necessary, by computerized procedures. 
Article 20 
1. Where an irregularity or offence has been committed in the course of a movement involving the chargeability of excise duty, the excise duty shall be due in the Member State where the offence or irregularity was committed from the natural or legal person who guaranteed payment of the excise duties in accordance with Article 15 (3), without prejudice to the bringing of criminal proceedings. 
Where the excise duty is collected in a Member State other than that of departure, the Member State collecting the duty shall inform the competent authorities of the country of departure. 
2. When, in the course of movement, an offence or irregularity has been detected without it being possible to determine where it was committed, it shall be deemed to have been committed in the Member State where it was detected. 
3. Without prejudice to the provision of Article 6 (2), when products subject to excise duty do not arrive at their destination and it is not possible to determine where the offence of irregularity was committed, that offence or irregularity shall be deemed to have been committed in the Member State of departure, which shall collect the excise duties at the rate in force on the date when the products were dispatched unless within a period of four months of the competent authorities of the correctness of the transaction or of the place where the offence or irregularity was actually committed. 
4. If, before the expiry of a period of three years from the date on which the accompanying document was drawn up, the Member State where the offence or irregularity was actually committed is ascertained, that Member States shall collect the excise duty at the rate in force on the date when the goods were dispatched. In this case, as soon as evidence of collection has been provided, the excise duty originally levied shall be refunded. 
Article 21 
1. Without prejudice to Article 6 (1), Member States may require that products released for consumption in their territory shall carry tax markings or national identification marks used for fiscal purposes. 
2. Any Member State which requires the use of tax marking or national identification marks as set out in paragraph 1 shall be required to make them available to authorized warehousekeepers of the other Member States. However, each Member State may require that fiscal marks be made available to a tax representative authorized by the tax authority of that Member State. 
Member States shall ensure that the procedure concerning these markings does not create obstacles to the free movement of products subject to excise duty. 
3. Tax markings or identification marks within the meaning of paragraph 1 shall be valid in the Member State which issued them. 
However, there may be mutual recognition of these markings between Member States. 
4. Mineral oils may be held, transported or used in Ireland, other than in the running tanks of vehicles permitted to use rebated fuel, only where they comply with that State's control and marking requirements. 
5. Intra-Community movement of products carrying a tax marking or national identification mark of a Member State within the meaning of paragraph 1 and intended for sale in that Member State, which are within the territory of another Member State, shall take place under cover of an accompanying document as provided for in Article 18 (1) and (3), or if the case arises, in accordance with Article 5 (2). 
TITLE IV Reimbursement 
Article 22 
1. In appopriate cases, products subject to excise duty which have been released for consumption may, at the request of a trader in the course of his business, be eligible for reimbursement of excise duty by the tax authorities of the Member State where they were released for consumption when they are not indented for consumption in that Member State. 
However, Member States may refuse request for reimbursement where it does not satisfy the correctness criteria they lay down. 
2. In the application of paragraph 1, the following provisions shall apply:
