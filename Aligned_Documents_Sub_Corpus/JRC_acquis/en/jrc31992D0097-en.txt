The total amount of the tender shall be written in figures and in words.

The conversion rate to be applied for the foreign currency payment shall be that in force 30 days prior to the latest date fixed for the submission of tenders. 
24.6. 
The price offered by the tenderer shall take into account the tax arrangements applicable as set out in the Convention.

In exceptional circumstances, prior to the expiry of the original tender validity period, the contracting authority may request the tenderer for a specified extension in the period of validity.

The tender guarantee of the successful tenderer shall be discharged when the tenderer has signed the contract and furnished the required performance guarantee, to the satisfaction of the contracting authority. 
26.6.

28.2. 
The tenderer and any of his personnel or agents will, so far as is practicable, be granted permission by the contracting authority to enter the place where the contract is to be executed for the purpose of such inspection, provided that the tenderer, his personnel or agents will release and indemnify the contracting authority and its personnel and agents from and against all liability in respect thereof. Accordingly, the tenderer will be responsible for any personal injury, whether fatal or otherwise, loss or damage which, but for acting on such permission, would not have arisen.

Opening of tenders 
33.1. 
On receipt of the tenders, the envelopes shall be entered in a special register in the order in which they arrive. The registration number and the date and time of arrival shall be recorded on the envelope. Envelopes remain sealed and are to be kept in a safe place until they are opened under the conditions set out in Articles 33.2 and 33.3. 
33.2. 
At a public tender opening, the tenderers' names, the tender prices, written notifications of tender modifications and withdrawals, the presence of the requisite tender guarantee, and such other details as the contracting authority may consider appropriate shall, if any, be announced. In the case of a 'two-envelope` system as mentioned in Article 31.2 the announcement shall include the fact that no price envelope has been opened. 
33.3. 
Opening and examination of tenders shall comply with the rules of the OCT concerned and shall be for the purpose of checking whether the tenders are complete, whether the requisite tender guarantee has been furnished, whether the documents have been properly signed and whether the tenders are generally in order. 
33.4. 
The envelopes which bear the words 'tender price` in accordance with Article 31 shall not be opened until the work of evaluating the tenders, other than the prices, has been completed. 
33.5. 
Only the tenders contained in those envelopes which have been received not later than the deadline referred to in Article 30.3 shall be taken into consideration in the evaluation. 
33.6. 
The contracting authority shall prepare, for its own records, minutes of the tender opening, including the information disclosed to those present in accordance with Article 33.2. 
33.7. 
After the public opening of tenders, information relating to the examination, clarification, evaluation and comparison of tenders and recommendations concerning the award of the contract shall not be disclosed to tenderers or other persons not officially concerned with such process. 
33.8. 
Any attempt by a tenderer to influence the contracting authority in the process of examination, clarification, evaluation and comparison of tenders, and in decisions concerning the award of the contract, shall result in the rejection of his tender. 
33.9. 
The delegate shall be present at the opening of tenders, and shall receive a copy of each tender. 
Article 34 
Evaluation of tenders 
34.1. 
To facilitate the examination, evaluation and comparison of tenders, the contracting authority may ask each tenderer individually for clarification of his tender, including breakdowns of unit prices. The request for clarification and the response shall be in writing and communicated by any of the means referred to in Article 12, but no change in the price or substance of the tender shall be sought, offered or permitted except as required to confirm the correction of arithmetic errors discovered by the contracting authority during the evaluation of the tenders pursuant to Article 34.7. 
34.2. 
Prior to the detailed evaluation of tenders, the contracting authority shall determine whether each tender is substantially responsive to the requirements of the tender dossier. 
34.3. 
For the purpose of Article 34, a responsive tender is one which conforms to all the terms, conditions and specifications of the tender dossier without material deviation or reservation. A material deviation or reservation is one which affects the scope, quality or performance of the contract, or which, in any substantial way, is inconsistent with the tender dossier or limits the contracting authority's rights or the tenderer's obligations under the contract, and affects unfairly the competitive position of tenderers presenting responsive tenders. 
34.4. 
If a tender is not responsive to the tender dossier, it shall be rejected by the contracting authority, and may not subsequently be made responsive by correction or withdrawal of the deviation or reservation. 
34.5. 
Tenders determined to be responsive shall be evaluated technically for conformity with the invitation to tender dossier and the provisions of Article 36, and then ranked on the basis of their technical qualities. The special conditions shall, where appropriate, specify the detailed criteria for technical evaluation. 
34.6. 
Following the completion of the technical evaluation, tenders which, on the basis of Article 34.5, are technically responsive shall be evaluated financially. Tenders shall be compared in the national currency. 
34.7. 
Tenders determined to be responsive shall be checked by the contracting authority for any arithmetic errors in computation and summation. Errors shall be corrected by the contracting authority as follows: 
(a) where there is a discrepancy between amounts in figures and also in words, the amount in words shall prevail; and 
(b) except for lump-sum contracts, where there is a discrepancy between the unit price and the total amount derived from the multiplication of the unit price and quantity, the unit price as quoted shall prevail, unless in the opinion of the contracting authority there is an obvious error in the unit price, in which event the total amount as quoted shall prevail and the unit price shall be corrected by the contracting authority. 
34.8. 
The amount stated in the tender, corrected if necessary by the contracting authority, in accordance with Article 34.7, shall be considered as binding upon the tenderer. If the tenderer does not accept the corrected amount of the tender, his tender shall be rejected. 
34.9. 
After tenders have been evaluated fully in accordance with the provisions of Article 34, responsive tenders shall be grouped into tenders offered by those tenderers eligible for preference under Article 9 and tenders offered by other tenderers. For the purposes of further evaluation and comparison of tenders only, the tender prices, corrected where necessary, of the tenderers not eligible for preference shall be increased by the percentage margin of preference. Further details of the procedures to be used in giving effect to the margin of preference provisions of Article 9 shall be as laid down by the contracting authority in the tender dossier. 
34.10. 
The evaluation proceedings shall be recorded in properly signed minutes which shall not be made public or communicated to any tenderer. A copy of these minutes will be sent to the delegate. 
Article 35 
Annulment of the tender procedure 
35.1. 
The contracting authority may, prior to awarding the contract, without thereby incurring any liability to the tenderers, and notwithstanding the stage reached in the procedures leading to the conclusion of the contract: 
(a) either decide to annul the tender procedure in accordance with Article 35.2, or order that the procedure be recommenced, if necessary, using another method; or 
(b) where the project is divided into lots, award only certain of the lots and possibly decide that the others are to be the subject of another tender or other tenders, if necessary, using another method. 
35.2. 
The annulment by the contracting authority of a tender procedure may take place in the following cases: 
(a) if no tender is responsive to the tender dossier; 
(b) if no tender satisfies the criteria for the award of the contract as set out in Article 36;

Article 49 
Measurement 
49.1. 
The following methods shall apply to the valuation of works contracts:

Where items are accompanied by quantities, these shall be firm quantities for which the contractor has submitted his all-in price, and shall be paid for irrespective of the quantities of work actually carried out; 
(b) for unit price contracts: 
(i) the amount due under the contract shall be calculated by applying the unit rates to the quantities actually executed for the respective items, in accordance with the contract; 
i(ii) the quantities set out in the bill of quantities shall be the estimated quantities of the works, which shall not be taken as the actual and correct quantities of the works to be executed by the contractor in fulfilment of his obligations under the contract; 
(iii) the supervisor shall determine by measurement the actual quantities of the works executed by the contractor, and these shall be paid for in accordance with Article 50. Unless otherwise provided in the special conditions no additions shall be made to the items in the bill of quantities except as a result of a variation in accordance with Article 37 or other provision of the contract entitling the contractor to additional payment; 
(iv) the supervisor shall, when he requires any parts of the works to be measured, give reasonable notice to the contractor to attend, or to send a qualified agent to represent him. The contractor or his agent shall assist the supervisor in making such measurements and shall furnish all particulars required by the supervisor.

i(v) the works shall be measured net, notwithstanding any general or local custom, except where otherwise provided for in the contract; 
(c) For cost-plus contracts, the amount due under the contract shall be determined on the basis of actual costs with an agreed addition for overheads and profit. The special conditions shall stipulate the information which the contractor is required to submit to the supervisor for the purpose of Article 49.1 (c) and the manner in which it should be submitted. 
49.2.

50.5. 
Within 30 days of receipt of the said application for interim payment, it shall be approved or amended in such a manner that, in the supervisor's opinion, the application reflects the amount due to the contractor in accordance with the contract.

52.1. 
When the supervisor receives a claim from a subcontractor duly approved under Article 7 to the effect that the contractor has not met his financial obligations so far as the subcontractor is concerned, the supervisor shall give notice to the contractor either to pay the subcontractor or to inform him of the reasons why payment should not be made. Should such payment not be made, or reasons not be given within the period of notice, the supervisor may, after satisfying himself that the work has been carried out, certify, and the contracting authority shall meet the debt claimed by the subcontractor out of the sums remaining due to the contractor. The contractor shall remain entirely responsible for the work in respect of which direct payment has been made. 
52.2. 
If the contractor gives adequate reasons for refusing to meet all or part of the debt claimed by the subcontractor, the contracting authority shall only pay to the subcontractor such sums as are not in dispute.

The contractor shall thereafter promptly submit such further particulars as the supervisor may reasonably require to assess the validity of the claim. 
55.2. 
When the supervisor has received the full and detailed particulars of the contractor's claim that he requires, he shall, without prejudice to Article 21.4, after due consultation with the contracting authority and, where appropriate, the contractor, determine whether the contractor is entitled to additional payment and notify the parties accordingly.

Article 57 
General clauses 
57.1.

57.2. 
Should exceptional circumstances make it impossible to ascertain the state of the works or otherwise proceed with their acceptance during the period fixed for provisional or final acceptance, a statement certifying such impossibility shall be drawn up by the supervisor after consultation, where possible, with the contractor. The verification shall take place and a statement of acceptance or rejection shall be drawn up by the supervisor within 30 days following the date on which such impossibility ceases to exist. The contractor shall not invoke these circumstances in order to avoid his obligation to present the works in a state suitable for acceptance. 
Article 58

However, works may in cases of urgency be taken over prior to acceptance provided an inventory of outstanding work is drawn up by the supervisor and agreed to by the contractor and the supervisor beforehand. Once the contracting authority has taken possession of a structure, a part thereof or section of the works, the contractor shall no longer be required to make good any damage resulting otherwise than from faulty construction or workmanship.

In the cases of partial provisional acceptance referred to in Articles 59.1 and 59.2 the maintenance period provided for in Article 62 shall, unless the special conditions provide otherwise, run as from the date of such partial provisional acceptance. 
Article 60

The contractor may apply, by notice to the supervisor, for a certificate of provisional acceptance not earlier than 15 days before the works, in the contractor's opinion, are complete and ready for provisional acceptance. The supervisor shall within 30 days after the receipt of the contractor's application either: 
(a) issue the certificate of provisional acceptance to the contractor with a copy to the contracting authority stating, where appropriate, his reservations, and, inter alia, the date on which, in his opinion, the works were completed in accordance with the contract and ready for provisional acceptance; or 
(b) reject the application giving his reasons and specifying the action which, in his opinion, is required of the contractor for the certificate to be issued. 
60.3. 
If the supervisor fails either to issue the certificate of provisional acceptance or to reject the contractor's application within the period of 30 days, he shall be deemed to have issued the certificate on the last day of that period. The certificate of provisional acceptance shall not be deemed to be an admission that the works have been completed in every respect. If the works are divided by the contract into sections, the contractor shall be entitled to apply for separate certificates for each of the sections. 
60.4. 
Upon provisional acceptance of the works, the contractor shall dismantle and remove temporary structures as well as materials no longer required for use in connection with the performance of the contract. He shall also remove any litter or obstruction and redress any change in the condition of the site as required by the contract. 
60.5. 
Immediately after provisional acceptance, the contracting authority may make use of all the works as completed. 
Article 61 
Maintenance obligations 
61.1. 
The contractor shall be responsible for making good any defect in, or damage to, any part of the works which may appear or occur during the maintenance period or within 30 days after its expiration and which arises either from: 
(a) the use of defective plant or materials or faulty workmanship or design of the contractor; and/or 
(b) any act or omission of the contractor during the maintenance period. 
61.2. 
The contractor shall at his own cost make good the defect or damage as soon as practicable. The maintenance period for all items replaced or renewed shall recommence from the date when the replacement or renewal was made to the satisfaction of the supervisor. If the contract provides for partial acceptance, the maintenance period shall be extended only for the part of the works affected by the replacement or renewal. 
61.3. 
If any such defect appears or such damage occurs, during the period referred to in Article 61.1, the contracting authority or the supervisor shall notify the contractor. If the contractor fails to remedy a defect or damage within the time limit stipulated in the notification, the contracting authority may: 
(a) carry out the works himself, or employ someone else to carry out the works, at the contractor's risk and cost, in which case the costs incurred by the contracting authority shall be deducted from monies due to or from guarantees held against, the contractor, or from both; or 
(b) terminate the contract. 
61.4. 
If the defect or damage is such that the contracting authority has been deprived substantially of the whole or a part of the benefit of the works, the contracting authority shall, without prejudice to any other remedy, be entitled to recover all sums paid in respect of the parts of the works concerned together with the cost of dismantling such parts and clearing the site. 
61.5. 
In case of emergency, where the contractor cannot be reached immediately or, having been reached, is unable to take the measures required, the contracting authority or the supervisor may have the work carried out at the expense of the contractor. The contracting authority or the supervisor shall as soon as practicable inform the contractor of the action taken. 
61.6. 
Where the special conditions stipulate that the maintenance work, necessitated by normal wear and tear, shall be carried out by the contractor, such work shall be paid for from a provisional sum. Deterioration resulting from the circumstances provided for in Article 21 or from abnormal use shall be excluded from this obligation unless it reveals a fault or defect justifying the request for repair or replacement under Article 61. 
61.7. 
The maintenance obligations shall be stipulated in the special conditions and technical specifications. If the duration of the maintenance period is not specified, it shall be 365 days. The maintenance period shall commence on the date of provisional acceptance. 
61.8. 
After provisional acceptance and without prejudice to the maintenance obligations referred to in Article 61, the contractor shall no longer be responsible for risks which may affect the works and which result from causes not attributable to him. However, the contractor shall be responsible as from the date of provisional acceptance for the soundness of the construction, as laid down in the special conditions or in the law of the State of the contracting authority. 
Article 62 
Final acceptance 
62.1. 
Upon the expiration of the maintenance period, or where there is more than one such period, upon the expiration of the latest period, and when all defects or damage have been rectified, the supervisor shall issue to the contractor a final acceptance certificate and a copy thereof to the contracting authority stating the date on which the contractor completed his obligations under the contract to the supervisor's satisfaction. The final acceptance certificate shall be given by the supervisor within 30 days after the expiration of the above stated period, or as soon thereafter as any works as instructed, pursuant to Article 61, have been completed to the satisfaction of the supervisor. 
62.2. 
The works shall not be considered as completed until a final acceptance certificate has been signed by the supervisor and delivered to the contracting authority, with a copy to the contractor. 
62.3. 
Notwithstanding the issue of the final acceptance certificate, the contractor and the contracting authority shall remain liable for the fulfilment of any obligation incurred under the contract prior to the issue of the final acceptance certificate, which remains unperformed at the time such final acceptance certificate is issued. The nature and extent of any such obligation shall be determined by reference to the provisions of the contract. 
BREACH OF CONTRACT AND TERMINATION 
Article 63 
Breach of contract 
63.1. 
Either party commits a breach of contract where he fails to discharge any of his obligations under the contract.

64.1. 
The contracting authority may, at any time and with immediate effect, terminate the contract, except as provided for under Article 64.2. 
64.2. 
Except as otherwise provided in these general conditions, the contracting authority may, after giving seven days notice to the contractor, terminate the contract and expel the contractor from the site in any of the cases where: 
(a) the contractor fails to carry out the works substantially in accordance with the provisions of the contract; 
(b) the contractor fails to comply within a reasonable time with a notice given by the supervisor requiring him to make good any neglect or failure to perform his obligations under the contract which seriously affects the proper and timely performance of the works; 
(c) the contractor refuses or neglects to carry out administrative orders given by the supervisor; 
(d) the contractor assigns the contract or subcontracts without the authorization of the contracting authority; 
(e) the contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or has a receiving order made against him, or compounds with his creditors, or carries on business under a receiver, trustee or manager for the benefit of his creditors, or goes into liquidation; 
(f) any adverse final judgment is made in respect of an offence relating to the professional conduct of the contractor;

64.3. 
Termination shall be without prejudice to any other rights or powers under the contract of the contracting authority and the contractor. The contracting authority may, thereafter, complete the works himself or conclude any other contract with a third party for the account of the contractor. The contractor's liability for delay in completion shall immediately cease when the contracting authority expels him from the site without prejudice to any liability thereunder that may have already ocurred. 
64.4. 
The supervisor shall, upon the issue of the notice of termination of the contract, instruct the contractor to take immediate steps to bring the works to a close in a prompt and orderly manner and to reduce expenditure to a minimum. 
64.5.

64.6. 
In the event of termination: 
(a) a report of work performed by the contractor shall be drawn up by the supervisor as soon as possible after inspection of the works, and inventory taken of temporary structures, materials, plant and equipment.

The supervisor shall also draw up statements of emoluments still owed by the contractor to workers employed by him in relation to the contract and of sums owed by the contractor to the contracting authority; 
(b) the contracting authority shall have the option of acquiring in whole or in part temporary structures which have been approved by the supervisor, plant and materials specifically supplied or manufactured in connection with the execution of work under the contract; 
(c) the purchase price of the temporary structures, equipment, plant and materials referred to above shall not exceed the unpaid portion of the expenditure incurred by the contractor, such expenditure being limited to that required for the performance of the contract under normal conditions; 
(d) the contracting authority may purchase, at market prices, the materials and items supplied or ordered by the contractor and not already paid for by the contracting authority on such conditions as the supervisor considers appropriate. 
64.7. 
The contracting authority shall not be obliged to make any further payments to the contractor until the works are completed, whereupon the contracting authority shall be entitled to recover from the contractor the extra costs, if any, of completing the works, or pay any balance due to the contractor prior to the termination of the contract. 
64.8. 
If the contracting authority terminates the contract, it shall be entitled to recover from the contractor any loss it has suffered up to the maximum amount stated in the contract. If no maximum amount is stated, the contracting authority shall not be entitled to recover more than the part of the contract price corresponding to the value of that part of the works which cannot, by reason of the contractor's failure, be put to the intended use. 
64.9. 
Where the termination is not due to an act or omission of the contractor, the latter shall be entitled to claim in addition to sums owing to him for work already performed, an indemnity for loss suffered. 
Article 65 
Termination by the contractor 
65.1. 
The contractor may, after giving 14 days notice to the contracting authority, terminate the contract if the contracting authority:

(b) consistently fails to meet his obligations after repeated reminders; or 
(c) suspends the progress of the works or any part thereof for more than 180 days, for reasons not specified in the contract, or not due to the contractor's default. 
65.2. 
Such termination shall be without prejudice to any other rights of the contracting authority or the contractor under the contract. Upon such termination, the contractor shall, subject to the law of the State of the contracting authority, be entitled to immediately remove his equipment from the site. 
65.3. 
In the event of such termination, the contracting authority shall pay the contractor for any loss or damage the contractor may have suffered. Such additional payment shall not exceed a limit which has to be specified in the contract. 
Article 66 
Force majeure 
66.1. 
Neither party shall be considered to be in default or in breach of his obligations under the contract if the performance of such obligations is prevented by any circumstances of force majeure which arises after the date of notification of award or the date when the contract becomes effective, whichever is the earlier. 
66.2. 
The term force majeure as used herein shall mean acts of God, strikes, lock-outs or other industrial disturbances, acts of the public enemy, wars whether declared or not, blockades, insurrection, riots, epidemics, landslides, earthquakes, storms, lightning, floods, washouts, civil disturbances, explosions, and any other similar unforeseeable events, not within the control of either party and which by the exercise of due diligence neither party is able to overcome. 
66.3. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 36 and 64, the contractor shall not be liable to forfeiture of his performance guarantee, liquidated damages or termination for default if, and to the extent that, his delay in performance or other failure to perform his obligations under the contract is the result of an event of force majeure. The contracting authority shall similarly not be liable, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 53 and 65, to payment of interest on delayed payments, for non-performance or for termination by the contractor for default, if, and to the extent that, the contracting authority's delay or other failure to perform its obligations is the result of force majeure. 
66.4. 
If either party considers that any circumstances of force majeure have occurred which may affect performance of his obligations, he shall promptly notify the other party and the supervisor, giving details of the nature, the probable duration and the likely effect of the circumstances. Unless otherwise directed by the supervisor in writing, the contractor shall continue to perform his obligations under the contract as far as is reasonably practicable, and shall seek all reasonable alternative means for performance of his obligations which are not prevented by the force majeure event. The contractor shall not put into effect such alternative means unless directed so to do by the supervisor. 
66.5. 
If the contractor incurs additional costs in complying with the supervisor's directions or using alternative means under Article 66.4, the amount thereof shall be certified by the supervisor. 
66.6. 
If circumstances of force majeure have occurred and continue for a period of 180 days then, notwithstanding any extension of time for completion of the works that the contractor may be reason thereof have been granted, either party shall be entitled to serve upon the other 30 days' notice to terminate the contract. If, at the expiry of the period of 30 days, force majeure still continues, the contract shall terminate and, in consequence thereof under the law governing the contract, the parties shall be released from further performance of the contract. 
Article 67 
Decease 
67.1. 
Where the contractor is a natural person, the contract shall be automatically terminated if that person dies. However, the contracting authority shall examine any proposal made by the heirs or beneficiaries if they have notified their wish to continue the contract. The decision of the contracting authority shall be notified to those concerned within 30 days of receipt of such proposal. 
67.2. 
Where the contractor consists of natural persons and one or more of them die, a report shall be agreed between the parties on the progress of the works and the contracting authority shall decide whether to terminate or continue the contract in accordance with the undertaking given by the survivors and by the heirs or beneficiaries, as the case may be. 
67.3. 
In the cases provided for in Article 67.1 and 67.2, persons offering to continue to perform the contract shall notify the contracting authority thereof within 15 days of the date of decease. 
67.4. 
Such persons shall be jointly and severally liable, or as otherwise stated in the special conditions, for the proper performance of the contract to the same extent as the deceased contractor. Continuation of the contract shall be subject to the rules relating to establishment of the guarantee provided for in Article 15. 
SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES

68.1. 
The contracting authority and the contractor shall make every effort to amicably settle disputes relating to the contract which may arise between them, or between the supervisor and the contractor. 
68.2. 
The special conditions shall prescribe: 
(a) the procedure for the amicable settlement of disputes; 
(b) the time limits within which the amicable settlement procedure may be invoked after notification of the dispute to the other party and the maximum time limit within which such settlement may be reached, which may not exceed 120 days from the commencement of the adopted procedure; 
(c) the time limits for responding in writing to a request for amicable settlement or to other requests permitted during the course of that procedure and the consequence of failure to comply with those time limits. 
68.3. 
The parties may agree to the settlement of the dispute by conciliation within a specific time limit by a third party after the amicable settlement procedure adopted has failed. 
68.4. 
The amicable settlement or conciliation procedure adopted shall in all cases involve a procedure in which complaints and responses are notified to the other party. 
68.5. 
In the absence of an amicable settlement or settlement by conciliation within the maximum time limits specified, the dispute shall: 
(a) in the case of a national contract, be settled in accordance with the national legislation of the State of the contracting authority; and

Subject to any additional provisions which may be laid down in the special conditions, the supplier shall be deemed to have satisfied himself before submitting his tender as to the correctness and sufficiency of the tender and to have taken account of all that is required for the full and proper performance of the contract and to have included in his rates and prices all costs related to the supplies, in particular: 
(a) the costs of transport;

16.2. 
Since the supplier is deemed to have determined his prices on the basis of his own calculations, operations and estimates, he shall carry out without additional charge any work which is the subject of any item whatsoever in his tender for which he neither indicates a unit price nor a firm sum.

Patents and licences 
Save where otherwise provided in the special conditions, the supplier shall indemnify the contracting authority and the supervisor against any claim resulting from the use, as specified in the contract, of patents, licences, drawings, designs, models, or brand or trade marks, except where such infringement results from compliance with the design or specifications provided by the contracting authority and/or the supervisor.

Article 20 
Extension of period of performance 
20.1. 
The supplier may request an extension to the period of performance if he is or will be delayed in completing the contract by any of the following causes: 
(a) extra or additional supplies ordered by the contracting authority; 
(b) exceptional weather conditions in the State of the contracting authority which may affect installation or erection of the supplies; 
(c) physical obstructions or conditions which may affect delivery of the supplies, which could not reasonably have been foreseen by a competent supplier; 
(d) administrative orders affecting the date of completion other than those arising from the supplier's default; 
(e) failure of the contracting authority to fulfil his obligations under the contract; 
(f) any suspension of the delivery and/or installation of the supplies which is not due to the supplier's default; 
(g) force majeure; 
(h) any other causes referred to in these general conditions which are not due to the supplier's default. 
20.2. 
The supplier shall, within 15 days of becoming aware that delay may occur, notify the supervisor of his intention to make a request for extension of the period of performance to which he considers himself entitled, and shall within 60 days thereafter, except where otherwise agreed between the supplier and the supervisor, deliver to the supervisor full and detailed particulars of the request, in order that such request may be investigated at the time. 
20.3. 
The supervisor shall, by written notice to the supplier after due consultation with the contracting authority and where approriate, the supplier, grant such extension of the period of performance as may be justified, either prospectively or retrospectively or, inform the supplier that he is not entitled to an extension. 
Article 21 
Delays in performance 
21.1. 
If the supplier fails to deliver any or all of the goods or perform the services within the time period(s) specified in the contract, the contracting authority shall, without formal notice and without prejudice to his other remedies under the contract, be entitled to liquidated damages for every day or part thereof which shall elapse between the end of the period specified for performance, or extended performance under Article 20, and the actual date of completion, at the rate and up to the maximum amount specified in the special conditions. 
21.2. 
If the contracting authority has become entitled to the maximum claim under Article 21.1 he may, after giving notice to the supplier: 
(a) seize the performance guarantee; and/or 
(b) terminate the contract; and 
(c) enter into a contract with a third party at the supplier's cost for the provision of the balance of the supplies. 
Article 22 
Variations 
22.1. 
The supervisor shall have power to order any variation to any part of the supplies necessary for the proper completion and/or functioning of the supplies. Such variations may include additions, omissions, substitutions, changes in quality, quantity, form, character, kind, as well as drawings, designs or specifications where the supplies are to be specifically manufactured for the contracting authority, method of shipment or packing, place of delivery, and in the specified sequence, method or timing of execution of the supplies. NÂ° order for a variation shall have the effect of invalidating the contract, but the financial effect, if any, of all such variations shall be valued in accordance with Article 22.5 and 22.7. 
22.2. 
NÂ° variation shall be made except by administrative order, provided that: 
(a) if for any reason, the supervisor shall find it necessary to give an order orally, he shall as soon as possible thereafter confirm the order by an administrative order; 
(b) if the supplier shall confirm in writing an oral order given for the purpose of Article 22.2 (a) and the confirmation shall not be contradicted in writing forthwith by the supervisor, an administrative order shall be deemed to have been issued for the variation; 
(c) an administrative order for variation shall not be required for increase or decrease in the quantity of any work where such increase or decrease is the result of the quantity exceeding or being less than that stated in the bill of quantities or price schedule. 
22.3. 
Save as provided by Article 22.2, prior to any administrative order for variation, the supervisor shall notify the supplier of the nature and form of such variation. As soon as possible, after receiving such notice, the supplier shall submit to the supervisor a proposal containing: 
(a) a description of the tasks, if any, to be performed or the measures to be taken and a programme for execution; and 
(b) any necessary modifications to the programme of performance or to any of the supplier's obligations under the contract; and 
(c) any adjustment to the contract price in accordance with the rules as set out in Article 22. 
22.4. 
Following the receipt of the supplier's submission referred to in Article 22.3, the supervisor shall, after due consultation with the contracting authority and, where appropriate, the supplier, decide as soon as possible whether or not the variation shall be carried out. If the supervisor decides that the variation shall be carried out he shall issue the administrative order stating that the variation shall be carried out at the prices and under the conditions given in the supplier's submission referred to in Article 22.3 or as modified by the supervisor in accordance with Article 22.5. 
22.5. 
The prices for all variations ordered by the supervisor in accordance with Articles 22.2 and 22.4 shall be ascertained by the supervisor in accordance with the following principles: 
(a) where the task is of similar character and executed under similar conditions to an item priced in the bill of quantities or price schedule it shall be valued at such rates and prices contained therein; 
(b) where the task is not of a similar character or is not executed under similar conditions, the rates and prices in the contract shall be used as the basis for valuation so far as is reasonable, failing which, a fair valuation shall be made by the supervisor; 
(c) if the nature or amount of any variation relative to the nature or amount of the whole of the contract or to any part thereof shall be such that in the opinion of the supervisor any rate or price contained in the contract for any item of work is by reason of such variation rendered unreasonable, then the supervisor shall fix such rate or price as in the circumstances he shall think reasonable and proper; 
(d) where a variation is necessitated by default or breach of contract by the supplier, any additional cost attributable to such variation shall be borne by the supplier. 
22.6. 
On receipt of the administrative order requesting the variation, the supplier shall proceed to carry out the variation and be bound by these general conditions in so doing as if such variation were stated in the contract. The supplies shall not be delayed pending the granting of any extension of time for completion or adjustment to the contract price. Where the order for a variation precedes the adjustment to the contract price, the supplier shall keep records of the costs of undertaking the variation and of time expended thereon. Such records shall be open to inspection by the supervisor at all reasonable times. 
22.7. 
Where on provisional acceptance, an increase or reduction in the total value of supplies required under the contract resulting from an administrative order, or from some other circumstance which is not caused by the supplier's default, exceeds 15 % of the contract price, the supervisor shall, after consultation with the contracting authority and the supplier determine any additions to or reduction from the contract price as a consequence of the application of Article 22.5. The sum so determined shall be based on the amount by which the increase or decrease in value of the supplies exceeds 15 %. The sum shall be notified by the supervisor to the contracting authority and the supplier and the contract price adjusted accordingly. 
Article 23 
Suspension 
23.1. 
The supervisor may, by administrative order, at any time, instruct the supplier to suspend: 
(a) progress of the manufacture of the supplies; or 
(b) delivery of supplies to the place of acceptance at the time specified for delivery in the performance programme or, if no time is specified, at the time appropriate for it to be delivered; or 
(c) the installation of the supplies which have been delivered to the place of acceptance. 
23.2. 
The supplier shall, during suspension, protect and secure the supplies affected at the supplier's warehouse or elsewhere, against any deterioration, loss or damage to the extent possible and as instructed by the supervisor, even if the supplies have been delivered to the place of acceptance in accordance with the contract but whose installation has been suspended by the supervisor. 
23.3. 
Additional expenses incurred in connection with such protective measure shall be added to the contract price. The supplier shall not be entitled to be paid any additional expenses if the suspension is: 
(a) otherwise provided for in the contract; or 
(b) necessary by reason of normal climatic conditions at the place of acceptance; or 
(c) necessary by reason of some default of the supplier; or 
(d) necessary for the safety or the proper execution of the contract or any part thereof insofar as such necessity does not arise from any act or default by the supervisor or the contracting authority. 
23.4. 
The supplier shall not be entitled to such additions to the contract price unless he notifies the supervisor, within 30 days after receipt of the order to suspend progress or delivery, of his intention to make a claim for them. 
23.5. 
The supervisor, after consultation with the contracting authority and the supplier, shall determine such extra payment and/or extension of the period of performance to be made to the supplier in respect of such claim as shall, in the opinion of the supervisor, be fair and reasonable. 
23.6. 
If the period of suspension exceeds 180 days, and the suspension is not due to the supplier's default, the supplier may, by notice to the supervisor, request permission to proceed with the supplies within 30 days, or terminate the contract.

Article 24 
Quality of supplies 
24.1.

Article 25 
Inspection and testing 
25.1. 
The supplier shall ensure that the supplies are delivered to the place of acceptance in time to allow the supervisor to proceed with acceptance of the supplies.

25.2. 
The supervisor shall be entitled either by himself or his agent, from time to time, to inspect, examine, measure and test the components, materials and workmanship, and check the progress of preparation, fabrication or manufacture of anything being prepared, fabricated or manufactured for delivery under the contract in order to establish whether the components, materials and workmanship are of the requisite quality and quantity.

(c) provide access for the supervisor at all reasonable times to the place where the tests are to be carried out. 
25.4. 
If the supervisor is not present on the date agreed for tests, the supplier may, unless otherwise instructed by the supervisor, proceed with the tests, which shall be deemed to have been made in the supervisor's 
presence. The supplier shall forthwith forward duly certified copies of the test results to the supervisor, who shall, if he has not attended the test, be bound by the test results. 
25.5. 
When components and materials have passed the tests referred to in Article 25, the supervisor shall notify the supplier or endorse the supplier's certificate to that effect. 
25.6. 
If the supervisor and the supplier disagree on the test results, each shall give a statement of his views to the other within 15 days after such disagreement arises. The supervisor or the supplier may require such tests to be repeated on the same terms and conditions or, if either party so requests, by an expert to be selected by common consent. All test reports shall be submitted to the supervisor who shall communicate the results of these tests without delay to the supplier. The results of the retesting shall be conclusive. The cost of retesting shall be borne by the party whose views are proved wrong by the retesting. 
25.7. 
In the performance of his duties, the supervisor and all persons authorized by him shall disclose only to those persons who are entitled to know of it information which he has obtained by reason of his inspection and testing of the methods of manufacture and operation of the undertaking. 
Article 26

28.2.

The supplier shall use the advance exclusively for operations connected with the provision of the supplies. Should the supplier misuse any portion of the advance, it shall become due and repayable immediately and no further advance payment shall be made to him. 
29.5. 
Should the advance guarantee cease to be valid and the supplier fail to re-validate it, either a deduction equal to the amount of the advance may be made by the contracting authority from future payments due to the supplier under the contract, or the contracting authority may apply the provisions of Article 11.6. 
29.6. 
If the contract is terminated for any reason whatsoever, the guarantees securing the advances may be invoked forthwith in order to repay the balance of the advances still owed by the supplier, and the guarantor shall not delay payment or raise objection for any reason whatever.

The detailed rules for the revision shall be as laid down in the special conditions. 
31.3.

In the event of changes to, or introduction of, any national or State statute, ordinance, decree or other law, or any regulation or by-law of any local or other public authority, after the date stated in Article 31.3 which causes a change in the contractual relationship between parties to the contract, the contracting authority and the supplier shall consult on how best to proceed further under the contract, and may as a result of such consultation decide: 
(a) to modify the contract; or 
(b) on payment of compensation for the resulting imbalance by one party to the other; or 
(c) to terminate the contract by mutual agreement. 
31.5. 
In the event of a delay in the execution of the contract for which the supplier is responsible or at the end of the period of performance revised as necessary in accordance with the contract, there shall be no further revision of prices within the 30 days before provisional acceptance except for the application of new price indexation, if this is to the benefit of the contracting authority. 
Article 32 
Interim payments 
32.1. 
Unless otherwise specified in the special conditions, the supplier shall submit an application for interim payment to the supervisor at the end of each period referred to in Article 32.7 in a form approved by the supervisor. The application shall include the following items, as applicable: 
(a) the estimated contract value of the supplies delivered up to the end of the period in question; 
(b) an amount reflecting any revision of prices pursuant to Article 31; 
(c) an amount to be withheld as retention sum under Article 30; 
(d) any credit and/or debit for the period in question in respect of supplies delivered under the contract, but not yet installed or commissioned in the amount and under the conditions set out in Article 32.2; 
(e) any other sum to which the supplier may be entitled under the contract. 
32.2. 
The supplier shall be entitled to such sums as the supervisor may consider proper in respect of supplies delivered under the contract, but not yet installed or commissioned, provided that: 
(a) the supplies conform to the specification of the contract and are set out in batches in a way that they may be recognized by the supervisor; 
(b) such supplies have been delivered to the place of acceptance, and are properly stored and protected against loss, damage or deterioration to the satisfaction of the supervisor; 
(c) the supplier's record of requirements, orders, receipts and use of goods and materials under the contract are kept in a form approved by the supervisor and such records are available for inspection by the supervisor; 
(d) the supplier submits with his statement, the estimated value of the supplies at the place of acceptance, together with such documents as may be required by the supervisor for the purpose of valuation of the supplies and providing evidence of ownership and payment therefor; and 
(e) where the special conditions so provide, ownership of the supplies shall be deemed to be vested in the contracting authority. 
32.3. 
Approval by the supervisor of any interim payment certified by him in respect of goods and materials pursuant to Article 32 shall be without prejudice to the exercise of any power of the supervisor under the contract to reject any goods and materials which are not in accordance with the provisions of the contract. Where the special conditions so provide, upon any such rejection the property in the rejected goods and materials shall immediately revert to the supplier. 
32.4. 
The supplier shall be responsible for any loss or damage to and for the cost of storing, handling of and removing from the place of acceptance, such goods and materials which have been rejected and shall effect such additional insurance as may be necessary to cover the risk of such loss or damage from any cause. 
32.5. 
Within 30 days of receipt of the said application for interim payment, it shall be approved or amended in such manner that, in the supervisor's opinion, it reflects the amount due to the supplier in accordance with the contract. In cases where there is a difference of opinion as to the value of an item, the supervisor's view shall prevail. On determination of the amount due to the supplier, the supervisor shall issue to the contracting authority and the supplier, an interim payment certificate for the amount due to the supplier and shall inform the supplier of the supplies for which payment is being made. 
32.6. 
The supervisor may, by an interim payment certificate, make any corrections or modifications to any previous certificate issued by him and shall have power to modify the valuation in or withhold the issuing of any interim payment certificate if the contract, or any part thereof, has not been executed to his satisfaction.

The frequency of interim payments shall be laid down in the special conditions in accordance with the characteristics of the supplies.

The special conditions may require certain interim payments to be fully secured by a guarantee approved in accordance with Article 11. 
Article 33 
Final statement of account 
33.1. 
Not later than 60 days after the issue of the final acceptance certificate referred to in Article 41, the supplier shall submit to the supervisor a draft final statement of account with supporting documents showing in detail the value of the supplies provided in accordance with the contract, together with all further sums which the supplier considers to be due to him 
under the contract in order to enable the supervisor to prepare the final statement of account. The special conditions may, however, in accordance with Article 33.6 state that the draft final statement of account and further proceedings related thereto, be dealt with before the issue of the provisional acceptance certificate. 
33.2. 
Within 60 days after receipt of this draft final statement of account and of all information reasonably required for its verification, the supervisor shall prepare the final statement of account, which determines: 
(a) the amount which in his opinion is finally due under the contract; and 
(b) after establishing the amounts previously paid by the contracting authority and all sums to which the contracting authority is entitled under the contract, the balance, if any, due from the contracting authority to the supplier, or from the supplier to the contracting authority, as the case may be. 
33.3. 
The supervisor shall issue to the contracting authority or its duly authorized representative, and to the supplier, the final statement of account showing the final amount to which the supplier is entitled under the contract. The contracting authority or its duly authorized representative and the supplier shall sign the final statement of account as an acknowledgement of the full and final value of the supplies provided under the contract and shall promptly submit the signed copy to the supervisor. However, the final statement of account shall not include amounts in dispute which are the subject of negotiations, conciliation, arbitration or litigation. 
33.4. 
The final statement of account signed by the supplier shall constitute a written discharge of the contracting authority confirming that the total of the final statement of account represents full and final settlement of all monies due to the supplier under the contract, other than those amounts which are the subject of amicable settlement, arbitration or litigation. However, such discharge shall become effective only after any payment due in accordance with the final statement of account has been made and the performance guarantee referred to in Article 11, has been returned to the supplier. 
33.5. 
The contracting authority shall not be liable to the supplier for any matter or thing whatsoever arising out of, or in connection with, the contract or provision of the supplies, unless the supplier shall have included a claim in respect thereof in his draft final statement of account. 
33.6. 
The provisions of Article 33 may be varied by the special conditions having regard to the practices in the State of the contracting authority. 
Article 34 
Payment to third parties 
34.1. 
All orders for payment to third parties may be carried out only after an assignment made in accordance with Article 6. The assignment shall be notified to the contracting authority. 
34.2. 
Notification of beneficiaries of the assignment shall be the sole responsibility of the supplier. 
34.3. 
In the event of a legally binding attachment of the property of the supplier affecting payments due to him under the contract, and without prejudice to the time limit laid down in Article 35, the contracting authority shall have 30 days, starting from the day when it receives notification of the definitive lifting of the obstacle to payment, to resume payments to the supplier.

Delayed payments 
35.1. 
Payment to the supplier of the amounts due under each of the interim payment certificates and the final statement of account issued by the supervisor shall be made by the contracting authority within 90 days of such certificate or statement being delivered to the contracting authority. If the period laid down for payment has been exceeded, the supplier shall qualify for interest calculated pro rata on the basis of the number of days delay at the rate specified in the special conditions subject to a maximum period, also specified therein. The supplier shall be entitled to such payment without prejudice to any other right or remedy under the contract. In the case of the final statement of account, the interest for the delayed payment shall be calculated on a daily basis at the rate specified in the special conditions. 
35.2. 
Any default in payment of more than 120 days from the expiry of the period laid down in Article 35.1 shall entitle the supplier either not to perform the contract or to terminate it. 
Article 36 
Payments in foreign currency 
Where under the contract the supplier is entitled to payments in foreign currency, the rates of exchange for calculating the payments shall be those prevailing, as determined by the Central Bank of the State of the contracting authority, 30 days prior to the latest date fixed for the submission of tenders for the contract. Such rates of exchange shall not be varied.

The packaging shall be sufficient to withstand, without limitation, rough handling, exposure to extreme temperatures, salt and precipitation during transit and open storage. Package size and weights shall take into consideration, where appropriate, the remoteness of the final destination of the supplies, and the possible absence of heavy handling facilities at all points in transit. 
37.3. 
The packaging, marking and documentation within and outside the packages shall comply with such special requirements as shall be expressly provided for in the contract, subject to any variations subsequently ordered by the supervisor. 
37.4.

The supplier shall be responsible for the delivery at the place of acceptance of all supplies and supplier's equipment required for the purpose of the contract. 
37.5. 
Each delivery must be accompanied by a statement drawn up by the supplier. This statement, the form of which shall be as prescribed by the special conditions, shall contain, in particular:

Where the supplies are delivered to an establishment of the contracting authority, the latter shall bear the responsibility of bailee, in accordance with the requirements of the law of the contract, during the time which elapses between delivery for storage and acceptance. 
37.8. 
All materials and goods supplied under the contract shall be fully insured, with the contracting authority as beneficiary, against loss or damage incidental to manufacture or acquisition, transportation, storage and delivery in the manner specified in the special conditions. 
Article 38 
Verification operations 
38.1. 
The supplies shall not be accepted until the prescribed verifications and tests have been carried out at the expense of the supplier. The inspections and tests may be conducted at the point of delivery and/or at the final destination of the goods. 
38.2. 
The supervisor shall, during the progress of the delivery of the supplies and before the supplies are taken over, have the power to order or decide: 
(a) the removal from the place of acceptance, within such time or times as may be specified in the order, of any supplies which, in the opinion of the supervisor, are not in accordance with the contract; 
(b) the substitution by proper and suitable supplies; 
(c) the removal and proper re-installation, notwithstanding any previous test thereof or interim payment therefor, of any installation which in respect of materials, workmanship or design by the supplier for which he is responsible, is not, in the opinion of the supervisor, in accordance with the contract; 
(d) that any work done or goods supplied or materials used by the supplier is or are not in accordance with the contract, or that the supplies or any portion thereof do not fulfil the requirements of the contract. 
38.3. 
The supplier shall, with all speed and at his own expense, make good the defects so specified. In case of default on the part of the supplier in carrying out such order, the contracting authority shall be entitled to employ other persons to carry out the orders and all expenses consequent thereon or incidental thereto 
shall be recoverable from the supplier by the contracting authority, or may be deducted by the contracting authority from any monies due or which may become due to the supplier. 
38.4. 
Supplies which are not of the required quality shall be rejected. A special mark may be applied to the rejected supplies. This shall not be such as to alter them or affect their commercial value. Rejected supplies shall be removed by the supplier from the place of acceptance, if the supervisor so requires, within a period which the supervisor shall specify, failing which they shall be removed as of right at the expense and risk of the supplier. Any work incorporating rejected materials shall be rejected. 
38.5. 
The provisions of Article 38 shall not affect the right of the contracting authority to claim under Article 21, nor shall it in any way release the supplier from any warranty or other obligations under the contract. 
Article 39 
Provisional acceptance 
39.1. 
The supplies shall be taken over by the contracting authority when they have been delivered in accordance with the contract, have satisfactorily passed the required tests, or have been commissioned, as the case may be, and a certificate of provisional acceptance has been issued or is deemed to have been issued. 
39.2. 
The supplier may apply, by notice to the supervisor, for a certificate of provisional acceptance not earlier than 15 days before the supplies, in the supplier's opinion, are complete and ready for provisional acceptance. The supervisor shall within 30 days after the receipt of the supplier's application either: 
(a) issue the certificate of provisional acceptance to the supplier with a copy to the contracting authority stating, where appropriate, his reservations and, inter alia, the date on which, in his opinion, the supplies were completed in accordance with the contract and ready for provisional acceptance; or 
(b) reject the application giving his reasons and specifying the actions which, in his opinion, are required of the supplier for the certificate to be issued. 
39.3. 
Should exceptional circumstances make it impossible to proceed with the acceptance of the supplies during the period fixed for provisional or final acceptance, a statement certifying such impossibility shall be drawn up by the supervisor after consultation, where possible, with the supplier. The certificate of acceptance or rejection shall be drawn up within 30 days following the date on which such impossibility ceases to exist. The supplier shall not invoke these circumstances in order to avoid the obligation of presenting the supplies in a state suitable for acceptance. 
39.4. 
If the supervisor fails either to issue the certificate of provisional acceptance or to reject the supplies within the period of 30 days, he shall be deemed to have issued the certificate on the last day of that period. The certificate of provisional acceptance shall not be deemed to be an admission that the supplies have been delivered in every respect. If the supplies are divided by the contract into lots, the supplier shall be entitled to apply for separate certificates for each of the lots. 
39.5. 
Upon provisional acceptance of the supplies, the supplier shall dismantle and remove temporary structures as well as materials no longer required for use in connection with the performance of the contract. He shall also remove any litter or obstruction and redress any change in the condition of the place of acceptance as required by the contract. 
Article 40 
Warranty obligations 
40.1. 
The supplier shall warrant that the supplies are new, unused, of the most recent models and incorporate all recent improvements in design and materials, unless otherwise provided in the contract. The supplier shall further warrant that all supplies shall have no defect arising from design, materials or workmanship, except insofar as the design or materials are required by the specifications, or from any act or omission of the contracting authority, that may develop under use of the supplies in the conditions obtaining in the State of the contracting authority. 
40.2. 
Unless otherwise specified in the special conditions, this warranty shall remain valid for 360 days after the supplies or any portion thereof, as the case may be, have been delivered and commissioned at the final destination indicated in the contract, or for 540 days after the date of shipment from the port of loading in the country of origin, whichever period ends earlier. The obligation to maintain the supplies shall be subject to any stipulations in the special conditions and specifications which shall determine the period and conditions thereof. 
40.3. 
The supplier shall be responsible for making good any defect in or damage to any part of the supplies which may appear or occur during the warranty period, or within 30 days after its expiration and which arise either: 
(a) from the use of defective materials, faulty workmanship or design of the supplier; or 
(b) from any act or omission of the supplier during the warranty period; or 
(c) in the course of an inspection made by, or on behalf of, the contracting authority. 
40.4. 
The supplier shall at his own cost make good the defect or damage as soon as practicable. The warranty period for all items replaced or repaired shall recommence from the date when the replacement or repair was made to the satisfaction of the supervisor. If the contract provides for partial acceptance, the warranty period shall be extended only for the part of the supplies affected by the replacement or repair. 
40.5. 
If any such defects appear or such damage occurs during the period referred to in Article 40.3, the contracting authority or the supervisor shall notify the supplier. If the supplier fails to remedy a defect or damage within the time limit stipulated in the notification, the contracting authority may: 
(a) remedy the defect or the damage itself, or employ someone else to carry out the work at the supplier's risk and cost, in which case the costs incurred by the contracting authority shall be deducted from monies due to or from guarantees held against the supplier or from both; or 
(b) terminate the contract. 
40.6. 
In case of emergency where the supplier cannot be reached immediately or, having been reached, is unable to take the measures required, the contracting authority or the supervisor may have the work carried out at the expense of the supplier. The contracting authority or the supervisor shall as soon as practicable inform the supplier of the action taken. 
Article 41 
After sales service 
An after sales service, if required by the contract, shall be provided in accordance with the details stipulated in the special conditions. The supplier shall undertake to carry out or have carried out the maintenance and repair of supplies and to provide a rapid supply of spare parts. The special conditions may specify that the supplier shall be required to provide any or all of the following materials, notifications and documents pertaining to spare parts manufactured or distributed by the supplier: 
(a) such spare parts as the contracting authority may elect to purchase from the supplier, provided that this election shall not relieve the supplier of any warranty obligations under the contract; and 
(b) in the event of termination of production of the spare parts advance notification to the contracting authority to procure needed requirements; and following such termination, furnishing at no cost to the contracting authority, the blueprints, drawings and specifications of the spare parts, if and when requested. 
Article 42 
Final acceptance 
42.1. 
Upon the expiration of the warranty period or where there is more than one such period, upon the expiration of the latest period and when all defects or damage have been rectified, the supervisor shall issue to the supplier a final acceptance certificate and a copy thereof to the contracting authority stating the date on which the supplier completed his obligations under the contract to the supervisor's satisfaction. The final acceptance certificate shall be given by the supervisor within 30 days after the expiration of the warranty period, or as soon thereafter as any rectifications instructed, pursuant to Article 40, have been completed to the satisfaction of the supervisor. 
42.2. 
The contract shall not be considered to be fully executed until the final acceptance certificate has been signed by the supervisor and delivered to the contracting authority, with a copy to the contractor. 
42.3. 
Notwithstanding the issue of the final acceptance certificate, the supplier and the contracting authority shall remain liable for the fulfilment of any obligation incurred under the contract prior to the issue of the final acceptance certificate, which remains unperformed at the time such final acceptance certificate is issued. The nature and extent of any such obligation shall be determined by reference to the provisions of the contract.

44.3. 
Termination shall be without prejudice to any other rights or powers under the contract of the contracting authority and the supplier. The contracting authority may, thereafter, conclude any other contract with a third party for the account of the supplier. The supplier's liability for delay in completion shall immediately cease upon termination without prejudice to any liability thereunder that may have already occurred. 
44.4. 
The supervisor shall, upon the issue of the notice of termination of the contract, instruct the supplier to take immediate steps to bring the execution of the supplies to a close in a prompt and orderly manner and to reduce expenditure to a minimum.

(b) the contracting authority may purchase, at market prices, the materials and items supplied or ordered by the supplier and not already paid for by the contracting authority on such conditions as the supervisor considers appropriate. 
44.7.

44.8. 
If the contracting authority terminates the contract, it shall be entitled to recover from the supplier any loss it has suffered up to the maximum amount stated in the contract. If no maximum amount is stated, the

(b) consistently fails to meet his obligations after repeated reminders; or 
(c) suspends the progress of the delivery of the supplies, or any part thereof, for more than 180 days, for reasons not specified in the contract, or not due to the supplier's default; 
45.2. 
Such termination shall be without prejudice to any other rights of the contracting authority or the supplier acquired under the contract. 
45.3. 
In the event of such termination, the contracting authority shall pay the supplier for any loss or damage the supplier may have suffered. Such additional payment shall not exceed a limit which has to be specified in the contract. 
Article 46 
Force majeure 
46.1. 
Neither party shall be considered to be in default or in breach of his obligations under the contract if the performance of such obligations is prevented by any circumstances of force majeure which arises after the date of notification of award or the date when the contract becomes effective, whichever is the earlier.

46.3. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 21 and 44, the supplier shall not be liable to forfeiture of his performance guarantee, liquidated damages or termination for default if, and to the extent that, his delay in performance or other failure to perform his obligations under the contract is the result of an event of force majeure. The contracting authority shall similarly not be liable, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 35 and 45, to payment of interest on delayed payments, for non-performance or for termination by the supplier for default, if, and to the extent that, the contracting authority's delay or other failure to perform its obligations is the result of force majeure. 
46.4. 
If either party considers that any circumstances of force majeure have occurred which may affect performance of his obligations, he shall promptly notify the other party and the supervisor, giving details of the nature, the probable duration and the likely effect of the circumstances.

The supplier shall not put into effect such alternative means unless directed so to do by the supervisor. 
46.5. 
If the supplier incurs additional costs in complying with the supervisor's directions or using alternative means under Article 46.4 the amount thereof shall be certified by the supervisor. 
46.6. 
If circumstances of force majeure have occurred and continue for a period of 180 days then, notwithstanding any extension of time for completion of the contract that the supplier may by reason thereof have been granted, either party shall be entitled to serve upon the other 30 days' notice to terminate the contract. If at the expiry of the period of 30 days, force majeure still continues, the contract shall terminate and, in consequence thereof under the law governing the contract, the parties shall be released from further performance of the contract. 
Article 47 
Decease 
47.1. 
Where the supplier is a natural person, the contract shall be automatically terminated if that person dies. However, the contracting authority shall examine any proposal made by the heirs or beneficiaries if they have

48.4. 
The amicable settlement or conciliation procedure adopted shall in all cases involve a procedure in which complaints and responses are notified to the other party. 
48.5.

Article 26 
Variations 
26.1. 
The supervisor shall have power, without changing the object or scope of the contract, to order any variation to any part of the services necessary for the proper completion of the services. Such variations may include additions, omissions, substitutions, changes in quality, quantity and changes in the specified sequence, method or timing of execution of the services. NÂ° order for a variation shall have the effect of invalidating the contract, but the financial effect, if any, of all such variations shall be valued in accordance with Articles 26.5 and 26.7. 
26.2. 
NÂ° variation shall be made except by administrative order, provided that: 
(a) if for any reason, the supervisor shall find it necessary to give an order orally, he shall as soon as possible thereafter confirm the order by an administrative order; 
(b) if the consultant shall confirm in writing an oral order given for the purpose of Article 26.2 (a) and the confirmation shall not be contradicted in writing forthwith by the supervisor, an administrative order shall be deemed to have been issued for the variation.

(a) where the task is of similar character and executed under similar conditions to an item priced in the price schedule it shall be valued at such rates and prices contained therein; 
(b) where the task is not of a similar character or is not executed under similar conditions, the rates and prices in the contract shall be used as the basis for valuation so far as is reasonable, failing which, a fair valuation shall be made by the supervisor; 
(c) if the nature or amount of any variation relative to the nature or amount of the whole of the contract or to any part thereof shall be such that in the opinion of the supervisor any rate or price contained in the contract for any task is by reason of such variation rendered unreasonable, then the supervisor shall fix such rate or price as in the circumstances he shall think reasonable and proper; 
(d) where a variation is necessitated by default or breach of contract by the consultant, any additional cost attributable to such variation shall be borne by the consultant. 
26.6. 
On receipt of the administrative order requesting the variation, the consultant shall proceed to carry out the variation and be bound by these general conditions in so doing as if such variation were stated in the contract. The services shall not be delayed pending the granting of any extension of time for completion or adjustment to the contract price. Where the order for a variation precedes the adjustment to the contract price, the consultant shall keep records of the costs of undertaking the vartiation and of time expended thereon. Such records shall be open to inspection by the supervisor at all reasonable times. 
26.7. 
Where on provisional acceptance, an increase or reduction in the total value of the services required under the contract resulting from an administrative order, or from some other circumstance which is not caused by the consultant's default, exceeds 15 % of the contract price, the supervisor shall, after consultation with the contracting authority and the consultant determine any additions to or reduction from the contract price as a consequence of the application of Article 26.5. The sum so determined shall be based on the amount by which the increase or decrease in value of the service exceeds 15 %.

Article 5

After examining the case, the conciliator or conciliation committee shall submit terms of settlement to the parties. 
5.10.

5.11. 
Copies of the record of settlement so signed shall be given to the parties. 
5.12. 
Should a settlement not result, the parties shall be at liberty to refer their dispute to arbitration under these rules, in which case, nothing that has transpired in connection with the proceedings before the conciliator or conciliation committee shall in any way affect the legal rights of any of the parties at the arbitration. 
5.13. 
NÂ° person having sat as a conciliator or a member of a conciliation committee for the settlement of a dispute may be appointed arbitrator for the same matter. 
II - THE TRIBUNAL 
Article 6 
Nationality of arbitrators 
To qualify for appointment as an arbitrator, a person must have the nationality of either the OCT or a Member State. 
Article 7 
Number of arbitrators 
If the parties agree, the tribunal shall be constituted by one arbitrator only. Such agreement must be reached by the parties within 15 days after receipt by the respondent of the notics commencing the arbitration proceedings as provided for in Article 18. If the parties fail to agree to arbitration by one arbitrator within the time specified, or if they otherwise agree, the tribunal shall be constituted by three arbitrators. 
Article 8 
Appointment of sole arbitrator 
8.1. 
If a sole arbitrator is to be appointed, the parties shall agree on that arbitrator or upon the appointing authority for making the appointment thereof within 60 days after the commencement of the arbitration proceedings as laid down in Article 18. 
8.2. 
Where: 
(a) the parties are unable to agree either on the arbitrator or on the appointing authority within the specified 60 days; or 
(b) the appointing authority agreed by the parties refuses to act, or fails to appoint the arbitrator, within 60 days of receipt of the parties' request therefore, 
either party may request the most senior in rank from amongst the judges of the International Court of Justice at the Hague who are nationals of the OCT and the Member States to exercise the powers of the appointing authority. 
Article 9 
Appointment of three arbitrators 
9.1. 
If three arbitrators are to be appointed, each party shall appoint one arbitrator. The two arbitrators thus appointed shall choose the third arbitrator who shall be the presiding arbitrator of the tribunal. 
9.2.

9.3. 
If: 
(a) within 30 days after the appointment by each party of his arbitrator, the two appointed arbitrators have not chosen the third arbitrator; or 
(b) within 30 days after the receipt of the notification of the appointment by one party of an arbitrator the other party has not notified the first party of the arbitrator he has appointed, 
the required arbitrator shall upon request by either party, be appointed by the appointing authority. 
9.4. 
The appointing authority shall be agreed by the parties not later than 60 days after the particular failure which gives rise to the need to invoke that authority. If after the expiration of that period an appointing authority has not been agreed by the parties, either party may request the most senior in rank from amongst the judges of the International Court of Justice at the Hague who are nationals of the OCT and the Member States to exercise the powers of the appointing authority. 
Article 10 
Appointments by the appointing authority 
10.1. 
When an appointing authority is requested to appoint an arbitrator, the party which makes the request shall send to the appointing authority a copy of the notice of arbitration specified in Article 18.1 and a copy of the contract under or in connection with which the dispute has arisen. The appointing authority may require from either party such information as he deems necessary to fulfil his function. 
10.2. 
Either party may propose names of persons suitable for appointment as arbitrators to the appointing authority. Where such proposal is made, the full names, addresses and nationalities of the persons proposed shall be given, together with a description of their qualifications. 
10.3. 
The appointing authority shall appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators as promptly as possible. In making the appointment, the appointing authority shall: 
(a) have regard to such considerations as are likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator of a nationality other than the nationalities of the parties, and of high moral standing, who has a recognized competence in the field of law, technical knowledge or finance applicable to the matters in dispute; and 
(b) unless both parties agree otherwise, or the appointing authority decides in his discretion that the procedure is not appropriate for the particular case, use the following list procedure: 
(i) the appointing authority shall communicate to both parties an identical list containing at least three names of persons qualified for appointment as arbitrators in terms of Articles 6.1 and 10.3 (a); 
i(ii) within 30 days after the receipt of this list, each party may return the list to the appointing authority after deleting the name or names to which he objects, and numbering the remaining names on the list in the order of his preference. If the list is not returned or no alteration is made in the order in which the names appear in the original list, the names on that list shall be deemed to have been approved by the party concerned in the order in which they appear; 
(iii) upon receipt of the list returned by both parties, or after the expiration of the time limit for the return, whichever is the earlier, the appointing authority shall within 30 days appoint the arbitrator from among the names approved or deemed to be approved, on the list and in accordance with the order of preference indicated by the parties; 
(iv) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the appointing authority may appoint a suitable arbitrator, having due regard to the interest of the parties, the nature of the dispute and, where applicable, the fact that one of the parties is a State. 
Article 11 
Challenge of arbitrators 
11.1. 
A prospective arbitrator shall disclose to those who approach him in connection with his possible appointment any facts or circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts or suspicion as to his impartiality or independence. A person appointed arbitrator shall disclose such facts or circumstances to the parties unless they have already been informed by him of these circumstances. 
11.2. 
Any arbitrator may be challenged by a party if facts or circumstances exist which give rise to justifiable doubts or suspicion as to his impartiality or competence. However a party may challenge an arbitrator appointed by him, or in whose appointment he has participated, only for reasons of which he becomes aware after the appointment has been made. 
11.3. 
A party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall send a notice of his challenge in writing, stating the reasons therefor to the tribunal, the challenged arbitrator and the other party. The notice shall be sent within 15 days of the constitution of the tribunal or of the appointment of the challenged arbitrator, whichever is later, or within 15 days after the circumstances justifying the challenge become known to the party making the challenge. 
11.4. 
Where a challenge made by one party is agreed by the other party, or where the challenged arbitrator withdraws from office, the authority of that arbitrator in the arbitration proceedings shall forthwith terminate. But neither the agreement of the parties to the challenge, nor the withdrawal from office of the challenged arbitrator, implies an acceptance of the validity of the grounds of the challenge issued. 
11.5. 
If the other party does not agree to the challenge, or if the challenged arbitrator does not withdraw, a decision on the challenge shall be made as follows: 
(a) where the appointment of the arbitrator was made by an appointing authority, by that authority; 
(b) where the appointment of the arbitrator was not made by an appointing authority, by the other members of the tribunal, if there are such others; 
(c) in all other cases, or in case of disagreement between the other members of the tribunal, by an appointing authority designated or to be designated in accordance with the procedure provided in Article 9.4. 
The decision of the authority specified herein shall be final. 
Article 12 
Replacement of arbitrator 
12.1. 
In the following cases, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 8, 9 and 10 which is applicable to the appointment of the particular arbitrator being replaced: 
(a) a challenge to an arbitrator has been agreed to by the other party; or 
(b) a challenged arbitrator has withdrawn from office; or 
(c) notwithstanding the absence of agreement of the other party, or a refusal by the challenged arbitrator to withdraw, a challenge to an arbitrator is sustained; or 
(d) an arbitrator dies during the course of the arbitration proceedings; or 
(e) for any other reason, an arbitrator fails to act or it becomes impossible de jure or de facto for him to perform his functions. 
12.2. 
If an arbitrator is replaced, any hearing held previously may, at the discretion of the tribunal, be repeated, and any decision or order made in the course of the proceedings may be set aside by the tribunal.

General provisions 
13.1. 
Subject to these rules, the tribunal may conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate. 
13.2.

The parties shall be treated with equality, and at any stage of the proceedings each of them shall be given a full opportunity of presenting his case. 
13.3. 
If either party so requests at any stage of the proceedings, the tribunal shall hold hearings for presentation of evidence by witnesses, including expert witnesses, or for oral argument.

13.4. 
All documents or information supplied to the tribunal by one party shall at the same time be communicated by that party to the other party. NÂ° such document or information may be used in support of a party's case unless there is proof that it has been communicated to the other party. 
Article 14 
Applicable law and procedural rules 
14.1. 
The tribunal shall apply the law of the State of the contracting authority to the matters in dispute, unless otherwise specified in the contract, in which case the tribunal shall apply the law so specified. In all cases, the tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the contract, and may take into account the usages of the trade applicable to the transaction. 
14.2. 
Where the applicable law is silent on any specific point, the tribunal shall apply the conflict of laws rules resulting from the law applicable to the contract. The tribunal may not decline to make an award on the ground that the law is silent or obscure on the point.

Article 16 
Venue of the proceedings 
16.1. 
Arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in the OCT concerned in which the contract was awarded or performed. However, the tribunal may, with the agreement of the parties and for good cause, decide to conduct the arbitration in some other place. In deciding on such other place, the tribunal shall have regard to the circumstances of the case, including the costs involved, the convenience of the parties, and the potential adverse effect of the procedural rules of an alternative venue on the parties and the proceedings. 
16.2. 
Subject to Article 16.1, the tribunal may hold some hearings and meetings at any place it deems appropriate, having regard to the circumstances of the case. 
16.3.

18.1. 
The claimant in an arbitration shall give to the respondent a notice of arbitration. Such notice shall be time-barred unless it is given not later than 90 days after the receipt of the decision closing the final administrative proceedings taken in the OCT concerned, or, where no such administrative procedures are available, not later than 90 days after the expiry of the 120 days provided for in Article 4.2 for the remedy of a complaint notified to the other party.

(d) the general nature of the claim and the amount involved, if any; 
(e) the relief or remedy sought; 
(f) a brief statement, with dates, of any administrative proceedings or of the notice given of complaints, and the outcome of such steps; 
(g) a proposal as to the number of arbitrators (i. e., one or three). 
18.4. 
The notice of arbitration may also include: 
(a) the name of the person and/or the authority proposed for appointment as a sole arbitrator and/or appointing authority referred to in Article 8.1; 
(b) the notification of the appointment by the claimant of an arbitrator referred to in Article 9.1; 
(c) the statement of claim referred to in Article 19. 
Article 19 
Statement of claim 
19.1. 
Unless the statement of claim was contained in the notice of arbitration, within a time limit to be determined by the tribunal, the claiment shall communicate his statement of claim in writing to the respondent and to each of the arbitrators. A copy of the contract shall be annexed thereto. 
19.2. 
The statement of claim, signed and dated by the claiment and/or his duly authorized representative, shall include the following particulars:

Within a time limit to be determined by the tribunal, the respondent shall communicate his statement of defence in writing to the claimant and to each of the arbitrators. 
20.2. 
The statement of defence shall reply to the particulars of the statement of claim given in compliance with Article 19.2 (b), (c) and (d). The respondent shall either annex to his statement the documents on which he relies for his defence or add a reference to the documents or other evidence he will submit. 
20.3. 
In this statement of defence, or at a later stage in the arbitration proceedings, if the tribunal decides that the delay was justified under the circumstances, the respondent may make a counter-claim arising out of the same contract, or rely on a claim arising out of the same contract for the purpose of a set-off. 
20.4. 
The provisions of Article 19.2 shall apply to a counter-claim and a claim relied on for the purpose of a set-off. 
Article 21 
Amendments to the claim or defence 
During the course of the arbitration proceedings either party may amend or supplement his claim or defence unless the tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment having regard to the delay in making it or the undue harm that it would cause to the other party. 
Article 22 
Pleas to the jurisdiction of the tribunal 
22.1. 
The tribunal shall have the power to rule on objections to its jurisdiction. 
22.2. 
The tribunal shall have the power to determine the existence or the validity of the contract. A decision by the tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not affect the validity of the arbitration clause in the contract or the agreement to submit the dispute to arbitration, and therefore, shall not affect the application of these rules. 
22.3. 
A plea that the tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than in the statement of defence or, with respect to a counter-claim, in the reply to the counter-claim. This provision shall also apply to new claims and counter-claims admitted in the course of the proceedings. 
22.4. 
In general, the tribunal should rule on a plea concerning its jurisdiction as a preliminary question. However, the tribunal may proceed with the arbitration and then rule on such a plea in its final award. 
Article 23 
Further written statements 
The tribunal shall decide which further written statements, in addition to the statement of claim and the statement of defence, shall be required from the parties or may be presented by them and, if so, the manner in which they shall be presented, and shall fix the time limits for communicating such statements. 
Article 24 
Time limits 
The time limits fixed by the tribunal for the communication of written statements (including the statement of claim and statement of defence) shall not, in each case, exceed 45 days. However, the tribunal may extend the time limits if it concludes that an extension is justified. 
Article 25 
Evidence 
25.1. 
Each party shall bear the burden of proving the fact relied on to support his claim or defence. 
25.2. 
The tribunal may, if it considers it appropriate, require the parties to deliver to the tribunal and to the other party, within such time limit as the tribunal shall decide, a summary of the documents and other evidence which that party offers to present in support of the facts in issue set out in his statement of claim or statement of defence. 
25.3. 
At any time during the proceedings, the tribunal may require the parties to produce documents, exhibits or other evidence within such time limit as the tribunal shall determine. 
Article 26 
Oral proceedings 
26.1. 
In the event of an oral hearing, the tribunal shall give the parties adequate advance notice of the date, time and place thereof. 
26.2. 
If witnesses are to be heard, each party shall communicate to the tribunal and to the other party, at least 15 days before the hearing, the names and addresses of the witnesses he intends to call, the subjects upon and the languages in which such witnesses will give their testimony. 
26.3. 
The tribunal shall make arrangements for the translation of oral statements made at a hearing and for a record of the hearing if either is deemed necessary by the tribunal under the circumstances of the case, or if the parties have agreed thereto and have communicated such agreement to the tribunal at least 15 days before the hearing. 
26.4. 
Hearings shall be held in camera unless the parties agree otherwise. The tribunal may require the retirement of any witness or witnesses during the testimony of other witnesses. The tribunal is free to determine the manner in which witnesses are examined, without prejudice to the right of each party, at its request, to question witnesses presented by the other party. 
26.5. 
Evidence of witnesses may also be presented in the form of sworn written statements signed by them. However, at the request of either party and with the leave of the tribunal, such witnesses may be heard at a hearing where the parties shall have the opportunity to be present and to question the witnesses. 
26.6. 
The tribunal shall determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of the evidence offered. 
Article 27 
Interim measures of protection 
27.1. 
At the request of either party, the tribunal may take any interim measures it deems necessary in respect of the subject matter of the dispute, including measures for the conservation, preservation or safe-custody of the goods forming the subject matter in dispute, such as ordering their deposit with a third person or the sale of perishable goods. The tribunal may also order the deposit of a sum of money or the provision of a security to guarantee the whole or any part of the amounts in dispute. In the event of failure to do so, the tribunal shall be entitled to draw such conclusions as may logically be imputed to such failure. 
27.2. 
Such interim measures may be established in the form of an interim award. The tribunal shall be entitled to require security for the costs of such measures. 
Article 28 
Experts 
28.1. 
The tribunal may appoint one or more independent experts to examine and report to it, in writing on specific issues to be determined by the tribunal. A party shall have the right to object to an expert on the ground of competence and partiality and if such objection is sustained by the tribunal that expert shall withdraw. A copy of the expert's terms of reference, established by the tribunal, shall be communicated to the parties. 
28.2. 
The parties shall give the expert any relevant information or produce for his inspection any relevant documents or goods that he may require of them. Any dispute between a party and such expert as to the relevance of the required information or production shall be referred to the tribunal for decision. 
28.3. 
Upon receipt of the expert's report, the tribunal shall communicate a copy of the report to the parties who shall be given the opportunity to express, in writing, their opinion on the report. A party shall be entitled to examine any document on which the expert has relied in his report.
