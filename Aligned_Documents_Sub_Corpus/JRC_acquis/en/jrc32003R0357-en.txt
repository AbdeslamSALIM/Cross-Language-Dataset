THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(2), and in particular Article 8(b) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulations (EC) No 1938/2001(3) and (EC) No 1939/2001(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2089/2002(5), and (EC) No 1940/2001(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 207/2003(7), allow rice mills to take part in the tendering procedure provided they comply with the rules laid down by those Regulations and in particular those concerning the processing of paddy rice into wholly milled rice and marking using certain colourants. 
(2) The efficiency of the measure, particularly as regards the processing time and the cost of verification, can be improved by laying down that manufacturers of compound feedingstuffs may take part in the tendering procedure by making the same undertakings as are currently imposed on rice mills. 
(3) Regulations (EC) No 1938/2001, (EC) No 1939/2001 and (EC) No 1940/2001 should therefore be amended. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,
