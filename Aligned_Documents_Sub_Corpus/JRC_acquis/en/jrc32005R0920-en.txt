Council Regulation (EC) No 920/2005 
of 13 June 2005 
amending Regulation No 1 of 15 April 1958 determining the language to be used by the European Economic Community and Regulation No 1 of 15 April 1958 determining the language to be used by the European Atomic Energy Community and introducing temporary derogation measures from those Regulations 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 290 thereof, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 190 thereof, 
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Articles 28(1) and 41(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The Irish Government has requested that the Irish language be accorded the same status as that accorded to the national official languages of the other Member States and that the necessary amendments be made to that effect to Council Regulation No 1 of 15 April 1958 determining the languages to be used by the European Economic Community [1] and to Council Regulation No 1 of 15 April 1958 determining the languages to be used by the European Atomic Energy Community [2], which two Regulations are hereinafter referred to as "Regulation No 1". 
(2) It results from Articles 53 of the Treaty on European Union and 314 of the Treaty establishing the European Community that the Irish language is one of the authentic languages of each of these Treaties respectively. 
(3) The Irish Government stresses that, in accordance with Article 8 of the Constitution of Ireland, the Irish language as the national language is the first official language of Ireland. 
(4) It is appropriate to answer positively to the Irish Government√¢&#x20AC;&#x2122;s request and to amend Regulation No 1 accordingly. It is however appropriate to decide that, for practical reasons and on a transitional basis, the institutions of the European Union are not to be bound by the obligation to draft and translate all acts, including judgments of the Court of Justice, in the Irish language. It is also appropriate to provide that such a derogation be partial, to exclude from its scope Regulations adopted jointly by the European Parliament and the Council and to empower the Council to determine unanimously, within a period of four years after the date of application of this Regulation and at five-yearly intervals thereafter, whether to put an end to that derogation,
