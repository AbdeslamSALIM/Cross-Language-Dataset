Council Joint Action 
of 22 June 2000 
concerning the control of technical assistance related to certain military end-uses 
(2000/401/CFSP) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 14 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) On 22 June 2000 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1334/2000(1) setting up a Community regime for the control of exports of dual-use items and technology, which provides an effective system of export controls of dual-use items, including software and technology. That Regulation, in Article 4, contains inter alia provisions concerning items not listed in Annex I which are or may be intended for use in connection with weapons of mass destruction or missiles for delivery of such weapons, or in connection with military goods for countries subject to EU, OSCE or UN arms embargoes. 
(2) The commitments of the Member States of the European Union regarding the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the export of conventional military goods to countries subject to arms embargoes require an effective export control system which should also cover, on the basis of common standards, technical assistance, including oral transfers of technology required to be controlled by the international export control regimes, bodies and treaties for weapons of mass destruction and missiles and for conventional military goods exported to countries subject to arms embargoes of the above types. It is appropriate to define such common standards in a joint action,
