'IV. IDENTIFICATION AND DETERMINATION OF FREE FORMALDEHYDE 
1.2 // 1. // PURPOSE AND SCOPE // // This method describes the identification and two determination according to the presence or not of formaldehyde donors. It is applicable to all cosmetic products. // 1.1. // Identification // 1.2. // General determination by pentane-2,4-dione colorimetry // // This method applies when formaldehyde is used alone or with other preservatives that are not formaldehyde donors. // // Where this is not the case, and if the result exceeds the maximum permitted concentration, the following method of confirmation must be used. // 1.3. // Determination in the presence of formaldehyde donors // // In the method mentioned above (1.2), during the derivization, the formaldehyde donors split and lead to results that are too high (combined and polymerized formaldehyde) // // It is necessary to separate the free formaldehyde by liquid chromatography. // 2. // DEFINITION // // The free formaldehyde content of the sample determined according to this method is expressed as percentage by mass. // 3. // IDENTIFICATION // 3.1. // Principle // // Free and combined formaldehyde in a sulphuric acid medium turns Schiff's reagent pink or mauve. // 3.2. // Reagents // // All reagents should be of analytical purity and the water has to be demineralized. // 3.2.1. // Fuchsin; // 3.2.2. // Sodium sulphite hydrated at 7H2O; // 3.2.3. // Concentrated hydrochloric acid (d=1,19); // 3.2.4. // Sulphuric acid, about 1M; // 3.2.5. // Schiff's reagent: // // 100 mg of fuchsin (3.2.1) is weighed into a beaker and dissolved in 75 ml of water at 80 °C. After cooling, add 2,5 g of sodium sulphite (3.2.2). Make up to 100 ml. // // Use within two weeks. // 3.3. // Procedure // 3.3.1. // Weigh 2 g of the sample in a 10-ml beaker. // 3.3.2. // Add two drops of sulphuric acid (3.2.4) and 2 ml of Schiff's reagent (3.2.5) . This reagent must be absolutely colourless when it is used. // // Shake and leave to stand for five minutes. // 3.3.3. // If a pink or mauve tint is observed within the five minutes, the formaldehyde is present in excess of 0,01 % and is to be determined by the free and combined method (4) and, if necessary, by procedure (5). // 4. // GENERAL DETERMINATION BY PENTANE-2,4-DIONE COLORIMETRY // 4.1. // Principle // // Formaldehyde reacts with pentane-2,4-dione in the presence of ammonium acetate to form 3,5-diacetyl-1,4-dihydrolutidine.

INTRUCTION FOR %quot%FRENCH KNITTING%quot% 
ACCESSORIES REQUIRED 
- One wooden bobbin: 
external diameter 5 cm with a hole of 1,5 cm diameter made through the centre. Insert four steel nails (as shown in Figures 1 and 2). The distance between two nails must be 1,8 cm and they must be 0,5 cm from the hole, 
- one rigid needle (of the crotchet-hook type) to loop the Teflon tube, 
- 5 m of 1,6 mm Teflon tube, internal diameter 0,3 mm. 
PROCEDURE 
To start off the %quot%French knitting%quot%, the Teflon tube must be threaded from the top of the bobbin to the bottom via the central hole (leaving around 10 cm of tube protruding from the bottom of the bobbin, enabling the chain to be pulled through during the knitting process); then wind the tube around the four nails in turn as shown in Figure 3. 
The top and bottom of the French knitting will be protected by metal rings and compression screws; take care not to crush the Teflon when pulling tight. Wind the tube around each nail for a second turn and make the 'stitches' as follows: 
- lift the lower tube over the upper tube with the hook (see Figure 4). Repeat this process on each of the nails in order (1, 2, 3, 4 in an anti-clockwise direction), until 5 m or the desired length of knitting is produced. 
Leave around 10 cm of tube to close the chain. Thread the tube through each of the four loops and pull gently, to close up the end of the chain. 
NB: French knitting manufactured for post column reactors is available on the market (Supelco). Schematic diagram of the bobbin

INTRUCTION FOR %quot%FRENCH KNITTING%quot% 
ACCESSORIES REQUIRED 
_ One wooden bobbin : 
external diameter 5 cm with a hole of 1,5 cm diameter made through the centre . Insert four steel nails ( as shown in Figures 1 and 2 ). The distance between two nails must be 1,8 cm and they must be 0,5 cm from the hole, 
_ one rigid needle ( of the crotchet-hook type ) to loop the Teflon tube, 
_ 5 m of 1,6 mm Teflon tube, internal diameter 0,3 mm . 
PROCEDURE 
To start off the %quot%French knitting%quot%, the Teflon tube must be threaded from the top of the bobbin to the bottom via the central hole ( leaving around 10 cm of tube protruding from the bottom of the bobbin, enabling the chain to be pulled through during the knitting process ); then wind the tube around the four nails in turn as shown in Figure 3 . 
The top and bottom of the French knitting will be protected by metal rings and compression screws; take care not to crush the Teflon when pulling tight . Wind the tube around each nail for a second turn and make the %quot%stitches' as follows : 
_ lift the lower tube over the upper tube with the hook ( see Figure 4 ). Repeat this process on each of the nails in order ( 1, 2, 3, 4 in an anti-clockwise direction ), until 5 m or the desired length of knitting is produced . 
Leave around 10 cm of tube to close the chain . Thread the tube through each of the four loops and pull gently, to close up the end of the chain . 
NB : French knitting manufactured for post column reactors is available on the market ( Supelco ).
