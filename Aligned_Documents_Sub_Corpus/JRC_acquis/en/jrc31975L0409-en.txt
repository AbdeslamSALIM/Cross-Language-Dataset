THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof; 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission; 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1); 
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2); 
Whereas it is necessary to amend Council Directive No 67/548/EEC (3) of 27 June 1967 concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances, as last amended by Directive No 73/146/EEC (4) ; whereas some of the provisions on the labelling and packaging of dangerous substances should be clarified and amplified ; whereas these provisions should in any case be harmonized with those of Council Directive No 73/173/EEC (5) of 4 June 1973 concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations (solvents); 
Whereas the dimensions of the label should be established in proportion to the capacity of the package; 
Whereas it is also necessary to adopt rules defining the relationship between markings for transport and markings for marketing and handling, in order to avoid double marking with different symbols; 
Whereas dangerous substances, although complying with the requirements of Directive No 67/548/EEC, could prove a hazard to health or safety ; whereas provision should therefore be made for a procedure to offset this hazard; 
Whereas it is necessary to make certain amendments to the wording of the German, English and Italian versions of the Directive,
