Commission Directive 2006/124/EC of 5 December 2006 amending Council Directive 92/33/EEC on the marketing of vegetable propagating and planting material other than seed and Council Directive 2002/55/EC on the marketing of vegetable seed (Text with EEA relevance) 
Commission Directive 2006/124/EC 
of 5 December 2006 
amending Council Directive 92/33/EEC on the marketing of vegetable propagating and planting material other than seed and Council Directive 2002/55/EC on the marketing of vegetable seed 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 92/33/EEC of 28 April 1992 on the marketing of vegetable propagating and planting material other than seed [1], and in particular Article 1(3) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/55/EC of 13 June 2002 on the marketing of vegetable seed [2], and in particular Articles 2(2) and 45 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Directive 2002/55/EC does not include all the vegetable genera and species covered by Directive 92/33/EEC. It is appropriate to extend the scope of Directive 2002/55/EC so that it applies to the same genera and species as Directive 92/33/EEC. 
(2) Directives 2002/55/EC and 92/33/EEC do not include Zea mays L. (popcorn or sweetcorn), a plant which is largely grown in certain new Member States. It is appropriate to extend the scope of both Directives to Zea mays L. Although maize, including popcorn and sweetcorn, is classified as a cereal under the legislation concerning the common agricultural policy, seed for sowing of sweet corn and popcorn must be submitted to the specific legislation concerning the marketing of seed of vegetables. 
(3) In the light of the development of scientific knowledge, a number of the botanical names used in Directives 92/33/EEC and 2002/55/EC have been shown to be incorrect or of doubtful authenticity. Those names should be aligned with those normally accepted internationally. 
(4) Directives 92/33/EEC and 2002/55/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
