Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the conclusion of an agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Kazakhstan on trade in certain steel products 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
The Community’s Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with the Republic of Kazakhstan provides that trade in certain steel products is governed by an Agreement between the Parties. 
An earlier Agreement on trade between the Community and the Republic of Kazakhstan in certain steel products covered the period from July 2002 to 31 December 2004. By its Decision of 2 November 2004, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate a new Agreement for the period 2005–2006. Negotiations have been completed successfully leading to the initialling of the new Agreement on 8 December 2004. 
That new Agreement sets quantitative limits for imports into the Community of certain steel products and will apply from the date of entry into force until 31 December 2006 or until Kazakhstan’s accession to the WTO, whichever date is earlier.

THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, 
of the one part, and 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN, 
of the other part, 
being the Parties to this Agreement, 
Whereas the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “PCA”) between the European Communities and their Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Kazakhstan, on the other part[3], signed on 23 January 1995 has entered into force on 1 July 1999,

Consultations shall take place immediately at the request of either Party to determine the level of the shortage on the basis of objective evidence. Following the conclusions of the consultations , the Community shall instigate its internal procedures to increase the quantities set out in Annex II. 
6. In the case where countries candidate for membership of the European Union would accede before the termination of this Agreement, the Parties agree to consider to increase the quantitative limits set out in Annex II. 
7. Either Party may, at any time, request consultations concerning :

5. Should the Parties be unable in the course of the consultations referred to in paragraph 3 to reach a mutually satisfactory solution, the Community shall have the right, where there is sufficient evidence that steel products covered by this Agreement originating in Kazakhstan have been imported in circumvention of this Agreement, to set off the relevant quantities against the quantitative limits set out in Annex II.

Should a sudden and prejudicial surge of imports arise, the Community will be entitled to request consultations in order to find a satisfactory solution to the problem. Such consultations shall be held immediately. 
4. In addition to the obligation contained in paragraph 3, where licences issued by the Kazakh authorities have reached 90 % of the quantitative limits for the calendar year in question, either Party may request consultations concerning the quantitative limits for that year. Such consultations shall be held immediately. Pending the outcome of such consultations the Kazakh authorities may continue to issue export licences for the products covered by this Agreement provided they do not exceed the quantities set out in Annex II.

TITLE V 
ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION 
Article 16 
The Parties shall cooperate closely in the implementation of the provisions of this Protocol. To this end, contacts and exchanges of views, including on technical matters, shall be facilitated by both Parties. 
Article 17 
In order to ensure the correct application of this Protocol, the Parties shall offer mutual assistance for the checking of the authenticity and the accuracy of export licences and certificates of origin issued or of any declarations made within the terms of this Protocol. 
Article 18 
Kazakhstan shall send the Community (European Commission) the names and addresses of the competent Kazakh authorities which are authorised to issue and to verify export licences and certificates of origin together with specimens of the stamps and signatures they use. Kazakhstan shall also notify the Community (European Commission) of any change in this information. 
Article 19 
1. Subsequent verification of certificates of origin or export licences shall be carried out at random, or whenever the competent Community authorities have reasonable doubt as to the authenticity of the certificate or licence or as to the accuracy of the information regarding the true origin of the products in question. 
2. In such cases, the competent authorities in the Community shall return the certificate of origin or the export licence or a copy thereof to the appropriate Kazakh authorities giving, where appropriate, the reasons of form or substance which justify an enquiry. If the invoice has been submitted, such invoice or a copy thereof shall be attached to the certificate or to the licence or their copies. The authorities shall also forward any information that has been obtained suggesting that the particulars given on the said certificate or licence are inaccurate. 
3. The provisions of paragraph 1 above shall also apply to subsequent verifications of the certificates of origin provided for in Article 2 of this Protocol. 
4. The results of the subsequent verifications carried out in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 above shall be communicated to the competent authorities of the Community within three months at the latest. The information communicated shall indicate whether the disputed certificate, licence or declaration, applies to the goods actually exported and whether these goods are eligible for export under the arrangements established by the Agreement. The information shall also include, at the request of the Community, copies of all the documentation necessary to fully determine the facts, and in particular the true origin of the goods. 
Should such verifications reveal systematic irregularities in the use of certificates of origin, the Community may subject imports of the products in question to the provisions of Article 2 (1) of this Protocol. 
5. For the purpose of subsequent verification of certificates of origin, copies of the certificates as well as any export documents referring to them shall be kept by the appropriate Kazakh authorities for at least one year following the end of the Agreement. 
6. Recourse to the random verification procedure specified in this Article must not constitute an obstacle to the release for free circulation of the products in question. 
Article 20 
1. Where the verification procedure referred to in Article 19 or where information available to the competent authorities of the Community or of Kazakhstan indicates or appears to indicate that the provisions of the Agreement are being circumvented or infringed, the two Parties shall cooperate closely and with the appropriate urgency in order to prevent any such circumvention or infringement. 
2. To this end, the appropriate Kazakh authorities shall, on their own initiative or at the request of the Community, carry out appropriate inquiries, or arrange for such inquiries to be carried out, concerning operations which are, or appear to the Community to be, in circumvention or infringement of this Protocol. Kazakhstan shall communicate the results of these inquiries to the Community, including any other pertinent information enabling the cause of the circumvention or infringement, including the true origin of the goods to be determined. 
3. By agreement between the Parties, officials designated by the Community may be present at the inquiries referred to in paragraph 2 above. 
4. In pursuance of the cooperation referred to in paragraph 1 above, the competent authorities of the Community and Kazakhstan shall exchange any information considered by either Party to be of use in preventing circumvention or infringement of the provisions of the Agreement. These exchanges may include information on the trade in the type of products covered by the Agreement between Kazakhstan and third countries, particularly where the Community has reasonable grounds to consider that the products in question may be in transit across the territory of Kazakhstan prior to their importation into the Community. This information may include at the request of the Community copies of all relevant documentation, where available. 
5. Where sufficient evidence shows that the provisions of this Protocol have been circumvented or infringed, the competent authorities of Kazakhstan and the Community may agree to take any measures as are necessary to prevent a recurrence of such circumvention or infringement.
