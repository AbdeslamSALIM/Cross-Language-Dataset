COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1110/1999 
of 10 May 1999 
providing for duty-free treatment of specified pharmaceutical active ingredients bearing an international non-proprietary name (INN) from the World Health Organisation and specified products used for the manufacture of finished pharmaceutical products 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
(1) Whereas, in the course of the Uruguay Round negotiations, the Community and a number of countries discussed duty-free treatment of pharmaceutical products; 
(2) Whereas the participants in those discussions concluded that, in addition to products falling within the Harmonised System (HS) Chapter 30 and HS Headings 2936, 2937, 2939 and 2941, duty-free treatment should be given to designated pharmaceutical active ingredients bearing an international non-proprietary name (INN) from the World Health Organisation, as well as specified salts, esters and hydrates of such products, and also to designated products used for the production and manufacture of finished pharmaceutical products; 
(3) Whereas the results of the discussions, as set out in the Record of Discussions, were incorporated into the tariff schedules of the participants annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to GATT 1994; 
(4) Whereas they also concluded that representatives of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) members party to the Record of Discussions would meet under the auspices of the Council for Trade in Goods of the WTO, normally at least once every three years, to review the product coverage with a view to including, by consensus, additional pharmaceutical products for tariff elimination; 
(5) Whereas the second such review has taken place with the conclusion that additional INNs and products used for production and manufacture of finished pharmaceutical products should be granted duty-free treatment and that the list of specified prefixes and suffixes for salts and esters of INNs should be expanded, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

As from 1 July 1999 the Community shall accord duty-free treatment for the INNs listed in Annex I as well as the salts, esters and hydrates of such products.
