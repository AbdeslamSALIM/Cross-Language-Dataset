COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 19 December 1991 amending Directive 69/169/EEC to extend and modify the exceptions granted to Denmark and to Ireland relating to travellers' allowances (91/673/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),

Whereas the said exceptions must be seen in the context of Article 8a of the Treaty, which defines the internal market as an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured and states that this market should be progressively established over a period expiring on 31 December 1992; 
Whereas immediate cessation of the said exceptions might result in economic difficulties for the Kingdom of Denmark and for Ireland; whereas their application should therefore be extended, in a modified form in Ireland's case, until 31 December 1992,
