The United Kingdom has decided to modify the public service obligations in respect of the scheduled air services between Glasgow and Campbeltown and Glasgow and Tiree as set out in the Notices published in Official Journal of the European Communities C 387/06 and C 387/07 of 21 December 1996, as modified in Official Journal of the European Communities/Union by C 355/03 of 8 December 1999, C 310/07 of 13 December 2002, and C 278/05 of 19 November 2003, pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes. 
2. The modified public service obligations are as follows: 
— Minimum frequencies 
- Two return trips per day except Saturday and Sunday between Glasgow and Campbeltown; 
and 
- One return trip per day except Sunday between Glasgow and Tiree.

- The capacity of the aircraft used on the Glasgow to Tiree route on Monday to Saturday should be not less than 13 seats (Glasgow to Tiree) and 16 seats (Tiree to Glasgow);

The new maximum fare on each route must be notified to the Civil Aviation Authority and will not enter into force prior to their notification to the European Commission which may publish them in the Official Journal of the European Union.
