Note: 
All enterprises authorised at the end of the reference period are included.

Branches of enterprises with head office in non-EEA countries are covered. For reinsurance enterprises no branches of enterprises with head office in non-EEA countries are recorded.

Code: 11 11 5

Definition 
%quot%Parent enterprise%quot%: shall mean a parent undertaking within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Council Directive 83/349/EEC of 13 June 1983 based on Article 54(3)(g) of the Treaty on consolidated accounts(2), and any undertaking which, in the opinion of the relevant supervisory authority, effectively exercises a dominant influence over the insurance enterprise. 
The following geographical breakdown of parent enterprises has to be used: parent enterprise situated in the home Member State (the observed enterprise can be regarded as domestic controlled), parent enterprise situated in other countries (the observed enterprise can be regarded as foreign controlled). As mutual enterprises and branches of insurance enterprises with head office in non-EEA countries do not have any parent enterprise, these enterprises are not considered here. The ultimate beneficiary ownership is the concept preferred which should as far as possible be followed. 
Note: 
For practical reasons Member States have the choice to deliver this variable only for those insurance enterprises which are - as regards their gross premiums written - under the top 90 % of the life insurance, non-life insurance, composite insurance and specialist reinsurance markets. If Member States follow this alleviation it has to be indicated.

Note: 
Enterprises wound up or being in the run-off or enterprises without a large amount of investments or provisions are excluded. All branches established abroad by an insurance enterprise which is registered in the home Member State are covered. 
PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT VARIABLES 
Note for the presentation of profit and loss account data 
The only data which should be provided with an algebraical sign are the variables for which values are likely to be either positive or negative depending on the business. 
For the variables which amounts are always positive or always negative, no algebraical sign should be provided. 
In the following, the variables which algebraical sign is not constant are marked: (+/-) 
IMPORTANT: 
an increase in a provision leads to an expenditure (e.g. an increase in the provision for unearned premiums leads to lower premiums earned compared to premiums written), the corresponding variable (e.g. change in the provision for unearned premiums) should therefore be reported with a MINUS sign. Inversely a drop in a provision leads to an income (e.g. a decrease in the provision for unearned premiums means higher premiums earned compared to premiums written) the corresponding variable should therefore be reported with a PLUS sign.
