Form of order sought 
The applicants claim that the Court should: 
- declare the action admissible and well founded, including the objection of illegality contained in it; 
- consequently, annul the applicants' pension statements for March 2005, so as to result in the application of a weighting for the capital of their country of residence or, at least, of a weighting such as to reflect adequately the differences in the cost of living in the places where the applicants are deemed to incur their expenditure and therefore to give effect to the principle of equivalence; 
- order the defendant to pay the costs. 
Pleas in law and main arguments 
The pleas and main arguments relied on by the applicants are identical to those relied on in Case F-128/05 Adolf and Others 
v Commission [1].
