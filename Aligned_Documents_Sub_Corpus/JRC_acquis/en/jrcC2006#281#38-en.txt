Questions referred 
1. Must Article 4(1) on the right of appeal of Directive 2002/21/EC [1] of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) be interpreted in such a way that a telecommunications undertaking must be considered to have a right of appeal against a decision in which the view is taken that a competitor of the telecommunications undertaking concerned does not have significant market power status? 
2. If the answer to Question 1 is affirmative, an answer to the following question is requested: 
Does the requirement in Article 4(1) of Framework Directive 2002/21/EC with regard to taking into account the facts of the case and an effective appeal mechanism mean that a national court may examine the facts of the case, make a legal evaluation, and give judgment in the case, without the Commission's decision under Article 7(4) of the Framework Directive and its reasoning in respect of a market analysis restricting the jurisdiction of the national court?
