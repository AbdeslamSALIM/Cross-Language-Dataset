Commission opinion 
of 24 November 2005 
concerning the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste resulting from modifications at the site of the Temelín Nuclear Power Plant located in the Czech Republic, in accordance with Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty 
(2005/C 293/08) 
(Only the Czech text is authentic) 
On 23 March 2005, the European Commission received from the Government of the Czech Republic, in accordance with Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty, General Data relating to the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste resulting from modifications at the site of the Temelín Nuclear Power Plant. 
On the basis of these General Data, the Commission has taken into consideration that the storage facility for irradiated fuel resulting from these modifications is mainly designed to store the spent nuclear fuel that will be generated by the Temelín Nuclear Power Plant during thirty years of operation and that the storage period will be limited to approximately 60 years. Following consultation with the group of experts, the Commission has drawn up the following opinion: 
1. The distance between the plant and the nearest neighbour Member States, in this case Austria and Germany, is approximately 45 km. 
2. Under normal operating conditions, the planned modifications are not liable to cause an exposure, significant from the point of view of health, of the population in other Member States. 
3. In the event of an accident of the type and magnitude considered in the General Data, the planned modifications are not liable to cause an exposure, significant from the point of view of health, of the population in other Member States. 
In conclusion, the Commission is of the opinion that the implementation of the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste in whatever form resulting from modifications at the site of the Temelín Nuclear Power Plant, located in the Czech Republic, both in normal operation and in the event of an accident of the type and magnitude considered in the General Data, is not liable to result in radioactive contamination, significant from the point of view of health, of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State.
