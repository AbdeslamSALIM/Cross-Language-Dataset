(more optional and additional data may be added to the back side of the card) 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004010EN.003601.TIF%quot%%gt% 
III.2. Data storage and protection 
Preceded by the harmonised common codes (where appropriate, in connection with the individual codes of the Member States according to Chapter II.7), the following data shall or may be additionally stored on the card surface bearing the legible information as per Chapter III.1: 
(A) Data as per Chapters II.4 and II.5 
All data specified in Chapters II.4 and II.5 shall be mandatorily stored on the card. 
(B) Other data as per Chapter II.6 
Moreover, the Member States are free to store more data as per Chapter II.6, to the necessary extent. 
(C) Other data as per Chapter II.7 
Optionally, additional information may be stored on the card. 
The data from the letters A and B is stored in two corresponding files with transparent structure (see ISO/IEC 7816-4). The Member States may specify the storage of data from Letter C according to their requirements. 
There are no read restrictions on these files. 
Write access to these files shall be restricted to the national competent authorities (and their authorised agencies) in the Member State issuing the smart card. 
Write access is permitted only after an asymmetric authentication with session key exchange for protecting the session between the vehicle registration card and a security module (e.g. a security module card) of the national competent authorities (or their authorised agencies). Thereby card verifiable certificates according to ISO/IEC 7816-8 are exchanged before the authentication process. The card verifiable certificates contain the corresponding public keys to be retrieved and to be used in the following authentication process. These certificates are signed by the national competent authorities and contain an authorisation object (certificate holder authorisation) according to ISO/IEC 7816-9 in order to encode role specific authorisation to the card. This role authorisation is related to the national competent authority (e.g. to update a data field). 
The corresponding public keys of the national competent authority are stored as trust anchor (root public key) in the card. 
The specification of the files and commands needed for the authentication process and the writing process is under the responsibility of the Member States. The security assurance has to be approved by common criteria evaluation according to EAL4+. The augmentations are as follows: 1. AVA_MSU.3 Analysis and testing for insecure states; 2. AVA_VLA.4 Highly resistant. 
(D) Verification data for authenticity of registration data 
The issuing authority calculates its electronic signature about the complete data of a file containing the data of the letter A or B and stores it in a related file. These signatures allow the authenticity of the stored data to be verified. The cards shall store the following data: 
- electronic signature of registration data related to letter A, 
- electronic signature of registration data related to letter B, 
For verification of these electronic signatures the card shall store: 
- certificates of the issuing authority calculating the signatures about the data of letters A, B. 
Electronic signatures and the certificates shall be readable without restriction. Write access to electronic signatures and certificates shall be restricted to the national competent authorities. 
III.3. Interface 
External contacts should be used for interfacing. A combination of external contacts with a transponder is optional. 
III.4. Storage capacity of the card 
The card shall have sufficient capacity to store the data mentioned in Chapter III.2.

(A) Supply voltage, programming voltage 
The card shall work with Vcc = 3V (+/0.3V) or with Vcc = 5V (+/0,5V). The card shall not require a programming voltage at pin C6. 
(B) Answer to reset 
The Information Field Size Card byte shall be presented at the ATR in character TA3. This value shall be at least %quot%80h%quot% (=128 bytes). 
(C) Protocol parameter selection 
The support of Protocol parameter selection (PPS) according to ISO/IEC 7816-3 is mandatory. It is used for selecting T=1, if T=0 is additionally present in the card, and to negotiate the Fi/Di parameters for achieving higher transmission rates. 
(D) Transmission protocol T = 1 
The support of chaining is mandatory. 
The following simplifications are allowed: 
- NAD Byte: not used (NAD should be set to %quot%00%quot%), 
- S-Block ABORT: not used, 
- S-Block VPP state error: not used. 
The information field size device (IFSD) shall be indicated from the IFD immediately after ATR, i.e. the IFD shall transmit the S-Block IFS Request after ATR and the card shall send back S-Block IFS. The recommended value for IFSD is 254 bytes. 
III.7. Temperature range 
The registration certificate in smart card format shall properly function under all climatic conditions usually prevailing in the territories of the community and at least in the temperature range specified in ISO 7810. The cards shall be capable of operating correctly in the humidity range 10 % to 90 %. 
III.8. Physical lifetime 
If used in accordance with the environmental and electricity-related specifications, the card must function properly for a period of ten years. The material of the card must be chosen in such a way that this lifetime is ensured. 
III.9. Electrical characteristics 
During operation, the cards shall conform to Commission Directive 95/54/EC of 31 October 1995(4), related to electromagnetic compatibility, and shall be protected against electrostatic discharges. 
III.10. File structure 
Table 1 lists the mandatory elementary files (EF) of the application DF (see ISO/IEC 7816-4) DF.Registration. All these files have a transparent structure. The access requirements are described in Chapter III.2. The file sizes are specified by the Member States according their requirements. 
Table 1 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
III.11. Data structure 
The stored certificates are in the X.509v3 format according ISO/IEC 9594-8. The electronic signatures are stored transparently. 
The registration data is stored as BER-TLV data objects (see ISO/IEC 7816-4) in the corresponding elementary files. The value fields are coded as ASCII character as defined by ISO/IEC 8824-1, the values %quot%C0%quot%-%quot%FF%quot% are defined by ISO/IEC 8859-1 (Latin1 character set), ISO/IEC 8859-7 (Greek character set) or ISO/IEC 8859-5 (Cyrillic character set). The format of dates is YYYYMMDD. 
Table 2 lists the Tags identifying the data objects corresponding to the registration data of the Chapters II.4 and II.5 together with additional data from Chapter III.1. Unless otherwise stated, the data objects listed in Table 2 are mandatory. Optional data objects may be omitted. The column of the Tag indicates the level of nesting.

III.12. Reading the registration data 
A. Application selection 
The application %quot%Vehicle Registration%quot% shall be selectable by a SELECT DF (by name, see ISO/IEC 7816-4) with its application identifier (AID). The AID value is requested from a laboratory selected by the European Commission. 
B. Reading data from files 
The files corresponding to Chapter II, Letters A, B and D, shall be selectable by SELECT (see ISO/IEC 7816-4) with the command parameters P1 set to %quot%02%quot%, P2 set to %quot%04%quot% and the command data field containing the file identifier (see Chapter X, Table 1). The returned FCP template contains the file size which can be useful for reading these files. 
These files shall be readable with READ BINARY (see ISO/IEC 7816-4) with an absent command data field and Le set to the length of the expected data, using a short Le. 
C. Verification of data authenticity 
To verify the authenticity of the stored registration data, the corresponding electronic signature may be verified. This means that besides the registration data also the corresponding electronic signature may be read from the registration card. 
The public key for signature verification can be retrieved by reading the corresponding issuing authority certificate from the registration card. Certificates contain the public key and the identity of the corresponding authority. The signature verification may be performed by another system than the registration card. 
The Member States are free to retrieve the public keys and certificates for verifying the issuing authority certificate. 
III.13. Special provisions 
Irrespective of the other provisions herein, the Member States, after notifying the European Commission, may add colours, marks or symbols. In addition, for certain data of Chapter III.2 Letter C, the Member States may allow XML format and may allow access via TCP/IP. 
Member States may, with the agreement of the European Commission, add other applications for which no harmonised rules or documents exist yet at EU level (e.g. roadworthiness certificate), on the vehicle registration card to realise additional vehicle related services.

- Production of false cards: creating a new object which bears great resemblance to the document, either by making it from scratch or by copying an original document. 
- Material alteration: changing a property of an original document, e.g. modifying some of the data printed on the document. 
The material used for Part II of the registration certificate shall be made secure against forgery by using at least three of the following techniques: 
- microprinting, 
- guilloche printing*, 
- iridescent printing, 
- laser engraving, 
- ultraviolet fluorescent ink, 
- inks with viewing angle - dependent colour*, 
- inks with temperature - dependent colour*, 
- custom holograms*, 
- variable laser images, 
- optical variable images. 
Member States are free to introduce additional security features.

III.2. Data storage and protection 
Preceded by the harmonised common codes (where appropriate, in connection with the individual codes of the Member States according to Chapter II.7), the following data shall or may be additionally stored on the card surface bearing the legible information as per Chapter III.1: 
(A) Data as per Chapters II.4 and II.5 
All data specified in Chapters II.4 and II.5 shall be mandatorily stored on the card. 
(B) Other data as per Chapter II.6 
Moreover, the Member States are free to store more data as per Chapter II.6, to the necessary extent. 
(C) Other data as per Chapter II.7 
Optionally, further vehicle-related data of general interest may be stored on the card. 
The data from the Letters A and B is stored in two corresponding files with transparent structure (see ISO/IEC 7816-4). The Member States may specify the storage of data from Letter C according their requirements. 
There are no read restrictions on these files. 
Write access to these files shall be restricted to the national competent authorities (and their authorised Agencies) in the Member State issuing the smart card. 
Write access is permitted only after an asymmetric authentication with session key exchange for protecting the session between the vehicle registration card and a Security Module (e.g. a Security Module Card) of the national competent authorities (or their authorised Agencies). Thereby Card Verifiable certificates according to ISO/IEC 7816-8 are exchanged before the authentication process. The Card Verifiable certificates contain the corresponding public keys to be retrieved and to be used in the following authentication process. These certificates are signed by the national competent authorities and contain an authorisation object (certificate holder authorisation) according to ISO/IEC 7816-9 in order to encode role specific authorisation to the card. This role authorisation is related to the national competent authority (e.g. to update a data field). 
The corresponding public keys of the national competent authority are stored as trust anchor (root public key) in the card. 
The specification of the files and commands needed for the authentication process and the writing process is under responsibility of the Member States. The security assurance has to be approved by Common Criteria Evaluation according to EAL4+. The augmentations are as follows: 1. AVA_MSU.3 Analysis and testing for insecure states; 2. AVA_VLA.4 Highly resistant. 
(D) Verification data for authenticity of registration data 
The issuing authority calculates its electronic signature about the complete data of a file containing the data of the Letter A or B and stores it in a related file. These signatures allow the authenticity of the stored data to be verified. The cards shall store the following data: 
- electronic signature of registration data related to Letter A, 
- electronic signature of registration data related to Letter B. 
For verification of these electronic signatures the card shall store: 
- certificates of the issuing authority calculating the signatures about the data of Letters A, B. 
Electronic signatures and the certificates shall be readable without restriction. Write access to electronic signatures and certificates shall be restricted to the national competent authorities. 
III.3. Interface 
External contacts should be used for interfacing. A combination of external contacts with a transponder is optional. 
III.4. Storage capacity of the card 
The card shall have sufficient capacity to store the data mentioned in Chapter III.2.

III.6. Technical characteristics and transmission protocols 
The format shall be ID-1 (normal size, see ISO/IEC 7810). 
The card shall support transmission protocol T = 1 in compliance with ISO/IEC 7816-3. Additionally other transmission protocols may be supported, e.g. T=0, USB or contactless protocols. For bit transmission the %quot%direct convention%quot% shall be applied (see ISO/IEC 7816-3). 
A. Supply voltage, programming voltage 
The card shall work with Vcc = 3V (+/0.3V) or with Vcc = 5V (+/0.5V). The card shall not require a programming voltage at pin C6. 
B. Answer to reset 
The Information Field Size Card byte shall be presented at the ATR in character TA3. This value shall be at least %quot%80h%quot% (=128 bytes). 
C. Protocol parameter selection 
The support of protocol parameter selection (PPS) according to ISO/IEC 7816-3 is mandatory. It is used for selecting T=1, if T=0 is additionally present in the card, and to negotiate the Fi/Di parameters for achieving higher transmission rates. 
D. Transmission protocol T = 1 
The support of chaining is mandatory. 
The following simplifications are allowed: 
- NAD Byte: not used (NAD should be set to %quot%00%quot%), 
- S-Block ABORT: not used, 
- S-Block VPP state error: not used. 
The information field size device (IFSD) shall be indicated from the IFD immediately after ATR, i.e. the IFD shall transmit the S-block IFS request after ATR and the card shall send back S-block IFS. The recommended value for IFSD is 254 bytes. 
III.7. Temperature range 
The registration certificate in smart card format shall properly function under all climatic conditions usually prevailing in the territories of the community and at least in the temperature range specified in ISO 7810. The cards shall be capable of operating correctly in the humidity range 10 % to 90 %. 
III.8. Physical lifetime 
If used in accordance with the environmental and electricity-related specifications, the card must function properly for a period of ten years. The material of the card must be chosen in such a way that this lifetime is ensured. 
III.9. Electrical characteristics 
During operation, the cards shall conform to Directive 95/54/EC, related to electromagnetic compatibility, and shall be protected against electrostatic discharges. 
III.10. File structure 
Table 1 lists the mandatory elementary files (EF) of the application DF (see ISO/IEC 7816-4) DF.Registration. All these files have a transparent structure. The access requirements are described in Chapter III.2. The file sizes are specified by the Member States according their requirements. 
Table 4 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
III.11. Data structure 
The stored certificates are in the X.509v3 format according ISO/IEC 9594-8. 
The electronic signatures are stored transparent. 
The registration data is stored as BER-TLV data objects (see ISO/IEC 7816-4) in the corresponding elementary files. The value fields are coded as ASCII character as defined by ISO/IEC 8824-1, the values %quot%C0%quot%-%quot%FF%quot% are defined by ISO/IEC 8859-1 (Latin1 character set) or ISO/IEC 8859-7 (Greek character set) or ISO/IEC 8859-5 (Cyrillic character set). The format of dates is YYYYMMDD. 
Table 2 lists the Tags identifying the data objects corresponding to the registration data of Chapter II.4 and II.5 together with additional data from Chapter III.1. Unless otherwise stated, the data objects listed in Table 2 are mandatory. Optional data objects may be omitted. The column of the Tag indicates the level of nesting.

III.12. Reading the registration data 
A. Application selection 
The Application %quot%Vehicle Registration%quot% shall be selectable by a SELECT DF (by name, see ISO/IEC 7816-4) with its Application identifier (AID). The AID value is requested from a laboratory selected by the European Commission. 
B. Reading data from files 
The files corresponding to Chapter II, letters A, B and D, shall be selectable by SELECT (see ISO/IEC 7816-4) with the command parameters P1 set to %quot%02%quot%, P2 set to %quot%04%quot% and the command data field containing the file identifier (see Chapter X, Table 1). The returned FCP template contains the file size which can be useful for reading these files. 
These files shall be readable with READ BINARY (see ISO/IEC 7816-4) with an absent command data field and Le set to the length of the expected data, using a short Le. 
C. Verification of data authenticity 
To verify the authenticity of the stored registration data, the corresponding electronic signature may be verified. This means that besides the registration data also the corresponding electronic signature may be read from the registration card. 
The public key for signature verification can be retrieved by reading the corresponding issuing authority certificate from the registration card. Certificates contain the public key and the identity of the corresponding authority. The signature verification may be performed by another system than the registration card. 
The Member States are free in retrieving the public keys and certificates for verifying the issuing authority certificate. 
III.13. Special provisions 
Irrespective of the other provisions herein, the Member States, after notifying the European Commission, may add colours, marks or symbols. In addition, for certain data of Chapter III.2 Letter C, the Member States may allow XML format and may allow access via TCP/IP. Member States may, with the agreement of the European Commission, add other applications for which no harmonised rules or documents exist yet at EU level (e.g. roadworthiness certificate), on the vehicle registration card to realise additional vehicle related services.
