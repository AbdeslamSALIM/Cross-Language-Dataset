Council Directive 92/22/EEC of 31 March 1992 on safety glazing and glazing materials on motor vehicles and their trailers 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/22/EEC of 31 March 1992 on safety glazing and glazing materials on motor vehicles and their trailers 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas measures should be adopted with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992; whereas the internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured; 
Whereas the total-harmonization method will be essential in order fully to achieve the single market; 
Whereas this method will have to be used at the time of the revision of the entire EEC type-approval procedure, taking account of the spirit of the Council resolution of 7 May 1985 concerning a new approach to the question of technical harmonization and standardization; 
Whereas the requirements relating to safety glazing differ from one Member State to another; whereas it is consequently necessary for the same requirements to be adopted by all of the Member States, either in addition to or in place of the existing rules, in order, in particular, to permit implementation, for each type of vehicle, of the EEC type-approval procedure covered by Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (4), as last amended by Directive 87/403/EEC (5); 
Whereas any rules on safety glazing shall contain not only requirements relating to its structure but also to its fitting to vehicles; 
Whereas by means of a harmonized procedure for the component type-approval of safety glazing, each Member State shall be able to confirm compliance with common requirements relating to manufacture and testing and to inform the other Member States of any such confirmation by forwarding a copy of the component type-approval certificate drawn up for each type of safety glazing; whereas the affixing of an EEC component type-approval mark to any type of safety glazing that conforme to the type that has been component type-approved means that the official testing of that type of glazing in other Member States is no longer justified; 
Whereas the safety aspect of windscreens is especially important since, more than in the case of other types of glazing, they are likely to be subjected to violent impact either as a result of collisions or where there are external shocks and can thus be the cause of serious bodily injury; whereas, while aiming at the approximation of the laws of the Member States, the differences between which raise barriers to trade, the solution to be adopted must take account of the safety requirements of road traffic and the need to improve same, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
1. Member States shall type-approve any type of safety glazing within the scope defined in Section 1 of Annex I that meets the structural and testing requirements. 
2. Member States shall grant whole-vehicle type approval to any vehicle that complies with the fitting requirements laid down in Annex III. 
3. The Member State which has granted EEC component type-approval shall take the necessary measures to verify, insofar as is necessary and if need be in cooperation with the competent authorities of the other Member States, that production models conform to the approved type. 
Article 2 
All applications for EEC component type-approval shall be made by the manufacturer or his authorized representative in a Member State. That Member State shall issue to the manufacturer or his authorized representative an EEC component type-approval mark in compliance with items 4.4 to 4.7 of Annex II for each type of safety glazing that it type-approves in pursuance of Article 1. 
Member States shall take all necessary measures to prevent the use of any marks liable to create confusion between items of safety glazing that have already been component type-approved pursuant to Article 1. 
Article 3 
The competent authorities in each Member State shall, within one month, send to the competent authorities of the other Member States a copy of the component type-approval certificate drawn up for each type of safety glazing and with regard to its fitting, for each type of vehicle to which they grant whole-vehicle type-approval. 
Article 4 
No Member State may prohibit the marketing or use of safety glazing on grounds relating to its construction where that glazing bears the EEC component type-approval mark. 
Article 5 
1. If the Member State which has granted EEC component type-approval finds that a number of items of safety glazing bearing the same component type-approval mark do not conform to the approved type, it shall take the necessary measures to ensure that production models do so conform. The competent authorities of that State shall advise those of the other Member States of the measures taken, which may, where necessary, extend to withdrawal of EEC component type-approval. The said authorities shall take like measures if they are informed by the competent authorities of another Member State of such failure to conform. 
2. The competent authorities of the Member States shall inform each other, within one month, of any withdrawal of EEC component type-approval, and of the reasons for such a measure. 
3. If the Member State which has granted EEC component type-approval disputes the failure to conform notified to it, the Member States concerned shall endeavour to settle the dispute. The Community shall be kept informed and shall, where necessary, hold appropriate consultations for the purpose of reaching a settlement. 
Article 6 
Any decision taken pursuant to the provisions adopted in implementation of this Directive to refuse or withdraw component type-approval, or prohibit sale and use, shall state in detail the reasons on which it is based. Such decision shall be notified to the party concerned, who shall at the same time be informed of the remedies available to him under the laws in force in the Member States and of the time-limits allowed for the exercise of such remedies. 
Article 7 
No Member State may refuse EEC whole-vehicle type-approval or national type-approval of a type of vehicle, or refuse or prohibit the sale, entry into service or use of a vehicle, on grounds relating to its safety glazing if this bears the EEC component type-approval mark and if it has been fitted in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex III. 
Article 8 
For the purposes of this Directive, 'vehicle' means any motor vehicle intended for use on the road, having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h as well as its trailer, with the exception of vehicles which run on rails, agricultural and forestry tractors or machinery, and construction plant and equipment.

ANNEX I 
SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS 1. SCOPE 
This Directive applies to safety glazing and materials for glazing intended to be fitted in the form of a windscreen or other glazing or separating panels on motor vehicles and their trailers, and to the fitting thereof, with the exception of glass for lighting and light-signalling devices and for the dashboard, and special glazing offering protection against attacks, surfaces made entirely of plastic material intended for use in the construction of category 0 vehicles, motor caravans, opening roofs, the rear windows of convertible vehicles and the sides of off-road vehicles, and windscreens intended for fitting to vehicles used in extreme environments having a maximum speed of 40 km/h. 
2. DEFINITIONS 
For the purposes of this Directive: 
2.1. Glazing means a pane of glass consisting of a single sheet of glass having undergone a special treatment intended to increase its mechanical strength and limit its fragmentation when smashed. 
2.2. Laminated glazing means: at least two sheets of glass held together by at least one sheet of plastic material that is sandwiched between them; that laminated glass may be: 
2.2.1. ordinary if none of the sheets of glass of which it consists has been treated; or 
2.2.2. treated if at least one of the sheets of glass of which it consists has undergone a special treatment intended to increase its mechanical strength and to limit its fragmentation when smashed. 
2.3. Safety glazing coated with plastic means: glazing as defined in item 2.1 or 2.2 with a coating of plastic material on its inner surface. 
2.4. Plastic-glass safety glazing means laminated glazing having a single sheet of glass and one or several sheets of plastic laid one on top of the other, at least one of which serves as a sandwich layer. The sheet(s) of plastic is (are) located on the inner surface when the glazing is fitted to the vehicle. 
2.5. Surface made entirely of plastic material: means a transparent surface manufactured entirely of organic polymeric material. 
2.6. Group of windscreens means a group consisting of windscreens having different shapes and dimensions which are subjected to an examination of their mechanical properties, fragmentation characteristics and their behaviour during tests on their resistance to attack from their environment; 
2.6.1. flat windscreen means a windscreen which does not have a nominal curvature represented by a segment height of more than 10 mm per linear metre; 
2.6.2. curved windscreen means a windscreen having a nominal curvature represented by a segment height of more than 10 mm per linear metre. 
2.7. Double window means a unit consisting of two panes fitted separately into the same aperture on the vehicle. 
2.8. Double glazing means a unit consisting of two panes assembled at the factory in a permanent manner and separated by a uniform space; 
2.8.1. symmetrical double glazing means double glazing in which the two constituent panes are of the same type (toughened, laminated, etc.) and have the same main and secondary characteristics; 
2.8.2. assymetrical double glazing means double glazing in which the two constituent panes are of a different type (toughened, laminated, etc.) or have different main and/or secondary characteristics. 
2.9. Main characteristic means a characteristic which significantly alters the optical and/or mechanical properties of a pane of glass with regard to the function that that glass is to perform on the vehicle. This term also includes the trade name or manufacturer's mark. 
2.10. Secondary characteristic means a characteristic which is likely to alter the optical and/or mechanical properties of a unit of glazing in a manner that is significant for the function for which it is intended on the vehicle. Account shall be taken of the indices of difficulty when the extent of the alteration is estimated. 
2.11. Indices of difficulty means a classification into two degrees that are applicable to the variations observed in practice for each secondary characteristic. The transition from index 1 to index 2 is an indication of the need to carry out traditional tests. 
2.12. Developed area of a windscreen means the area of the minimum rectangle of glass from which a windscreen can be made. 
2.13. Rake angle of a windscreen means the angle formed by the vertical line and the straight line joining the upper and lower edges of the windscreen, these straight lines being taken in a vertical plane containing the longitudinal access of the vehicle; 
2.13.1. the rake angle is measured on a vehicle on the ground and, where the vehicle is used to carry passengers, that vehicle must be in running order, with a full complement of fuel, liquid coolant and lubricant, with tools and spare wheels in place (if these are considered to form part of the standard equipment by the vehicle's manufacturer); account shall be taken of the weight of the driver and, where vehicles are intended to carry additional passengers, of the weight of a passenger on the front seat, the driver and passenger each being taken to a 75 ± 1 kg; 
2.13.2. where vehicles are fitted with hydropneumatic, hydraulic or pneumatic suspension or with a device automatically regulating ground clearance as a function of load they shall be tested under the normal operating conditions specified by the manufacturer. 
2.14. Segment height h means the maximum distance separating the internal surface of a unit of glazing from a plane passing through the edges of that unit. This distance shall be measured in a direction which is practically normal to the glazing (see Annex II M, Figure 1). 
2.15. Type of glazing means the glazing defined in items 2.1 to 2.4 which does not display any essential differences, and in particular as regards the main and secondary characters mentioned in Annexes II B, II C, II D, II H, II I, II J, II K and II L; 
2.15.1. although a change in the main characteristics means a new type of product, in certain cases it is accepted that a change in shape and dimensions does not necessarily involve an obligation to carry out a full series of tests. For certain of the tests specified in the separate Annexes glazing units may be grouped together if it is clear that they have similar main characteristics; 
2.15.2. glazing units only having different secondary characteristics may be considered to be of the same type; however, certain tests can be carried out on samples of such glazing if those tests are explicitly stipulated in the test conditions. 
2.16. Type of vehicle, as regards the fitting of safety glazing, means vehicles which do not show any essential differences, in particular as regards the type of glazing defined in item 2.15 and fitted on the vehicle. 
2.17. Curver means the approximate value of the smallest radius of the arc of the windscreen measured at its most inwardly curved part. 
ANNEX II 
GLAZING - STRUCTURAL AND TESTING REQUIREMENTS, APPLICATION FOR EEC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL, MARKING, EEC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL, AMENDMENT OR EXTENSION OF EEC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL, CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION MODELS AND PENALTIES FOR NON-CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION 1. 
STRUCTURAL AND TESTING REQUIREMENTS 
1.1. 
General specifications 
1.1.1. 
All types of glass, and in particular glass intended to be used for windscreens must be of a quality enabling the risk of corporal damage in the event of breakage to be reduced as much as possible. The glass must offer adequate resistance to any stressing which may arise during accidents occurring under normal traffic conditions, and similarly to atmospheric and thermal factors, chemical agents, fire and abrasion. 
1.1.2. 
In addition safety glass shall be adequately transparent, cause no noticeable deformation of objects seen through the windscreen, nor cause any confusion between the colours used on road signs. In the event of windscreen breakage the driver must continue to be able to see the road clearly enough in order to be able to brake and bring his vehicle to a halt in complete safety. 
1.2. 
Individual specifications 
Depending on the category to which they belong all types of glazing must meet the following individual specifications: 
1.2.1. 
as regards panes of uniformly toughened glass windscreens, the requirements set out in Annex II H; 
1.2.2. 
in the case of ordinary laminated glass windscreens, the requirements set out in Annex II B; 
1.2.3. 
in the case of panes of ordinary laminated glass apart from windscreens, the requirements set out in Annex II I; 
1.2.4. 
in the case of treated laminated glass windscreens, the requirements set out in Annex II C; 
1.2.5. 
in the case of plastic-coated safety glass the requirements set out in Annex II K in addition to the appropriate requirements listed above; 
1.2.6. 
in the case of plastic-glass windscreens, the requirements set out in Annex II D;

Light transmission test 
9.1.1. 
Apparatus 
9.1.1.1. 
Light source consisting of an incandescent lamp having its filament contained in a parallelepiped measuring 1,5×1,5×3 mm. The voltage at the lamp filament shall be such that the colour temperature is 2 856 ± 50 K. This voltage shall be stabilized within ± 1/1000. The instrument used to check the voltage shall be of appropriate accuracy. 
9.1.1.2. 
Optical system consisting of a lens with a focal length of at least 500 mm and corrected for chromatic abberations. The full aperture of the lens shall not exceed f/20. The distance between the lens and the light source shall be so adjusted as to obtain a light beam which is substantially parallel. A diaphragm shall be inserted to limit the diameter of the light beam to 7 ± 1 mm. This diaphragm shall be situated at a distance of 100 ± 50 mm from the lens on the side remote from the light source. The point of measurement shall be taken at the centre of the light beam. 
9.1.1.3. 
Measuring equipment 
The receiver shall have a relative spectral sensitivity in substantial agreement with the relative ICI (7) spectral luminous efficiency for photopic vision. The sensitive surface of the receiver shall be covered with a diffusing medium and shall have at least twice the cross section of the parallel light beam emitted by the optical system. If an integrating sphere is used the aperture of the sphere shall have a cross sectional area at least twice that of the parallel portion of the beam. 
The linearity of the receiver and the associated measuring instrument shall be better than 2 % of the effective part of the scale. 
The centre of the receiver shall coincide with the axis of the light beam. 
9.1.2. 
Procedure 
Adjust the instrument indicating the response of the receiver so that it indicates 100 divisions when the safety-glass pane is not inserted in the light path. 
When no light is falling on the receiver the instrument shall read zero. 
Place the safety-glass pane at a distance from the receiver equal to approximately five times the diameter of the receiver. Insert the safety glass pane between the diaphragm and the receiver and adjust its inclination in such a way that the angle of the incidence of the light beam is equal to ± 5o. The regular transmittance shall be measured on the safety-glass pane, and for every point measured the number of divisions, 'n', shown on the indicating instrument, shall be read. The regular transmittance r is equal to n/100. 
9.1.2.1. 
In the case of windscreens, alternative test methods may be applied using either a test piece cut from the flattest part of a windscreen or a specially prepared flat square with material and thickness characteristics identical to those of the actual windscreen, the measurements being taken normal (perpendicular) to the glass pane. 
9.1.2.2. 
In the case of windscreens intended for category-M1 vehicles, the test shall be carried out in the zone B defined in Annex II F. In the case of all other vehicles the test shall be carried out in zone I provided for in item 9.2.5.2.3 in this Annex.

In the case of windows situated at points which are not essential to the driver's field of vision (glazed roof, for example), the regular transmission factor of the light from the pane may be less than 70 %. 
Glazing materials whose regular light transmission factor is less than 70 % must be marked with the supplementry symbol provided for in item 4.5.2 of Annex II. 
9.2. 
Optical-distortion test 
9.2.1. 
Scope 
The method specified is a projection method which permits evaluation of the optical distortion of a safety-glass pane. 
9.2.1.1. 
Definitions 
9.2.1.1.1. 
Optical deviation: the angle between the true and apparent direction of a point viewed through the safety-glass pane, the magnitude of the angle being a function of the angle of incidence of the line of sight, the thickness and inclination of the glass pane and the radius of curvature at the point of incidence. 
9.2.1.1.2. 
Optical distortion in a direction MM%amp% prime;: the algebraic difference in angular deviation AEá measured between two points M and M%amp% prime; on the surface of the safety-glass pane, the distance between the two points being such that their projections in a plane at right angles to the direction of vision are separated by a given distance AEx (see Figure 6). 
Anti-clockwise deviation should be regarded as positive and clockwise deviation as negative. 
9.2.1.1.3. 
Optical distortion at a point M: the optical-distortion maximum for all directions MM%amp% prime; from the point M. 
9.2.1.2. 
Apparatus 
This method entails the projection of an appropriate slide (raster) onto the display screen through the safety-glass pane being tested. The change caused in the shape of the projected image by the insertion of the safety-glass pane in the line of sight provides a measure of the distortion. The apparatus shall comprise the following items, arranged as shown in Figure 9. 
Notes: AEa = á1-á2, i.e. the optical distortion in the direction MM%amp% prime;. 
AEx = MC i.e. the distance between two straight lines parallel to the direction of vision and passing through the points M and M%amp% prime;. 
9.2.1.2.1. 
Projector, of good quality, with a high-intensity point light source, having for example the following characteristics: 
- focal length of at least 90 mm, 
- aperture approximately 1/2,5, 
- 150 W quartz halogen lamp (used without a filter), 
- 250 W quartz halogen lamp (if used with a green filter). 
The projector is shown schematically in Figure 7. A diaphragm of 8 mm diameter is positioned approximately 100 mm from the front lens. 
9.2.1.2.2. 
Slides (rasters) consisting, for example, of an array of bright circular shapes on a dark background (see Figure 8). The slides shall be of sufficiently high quality and contrast to enable measurements to be carried out with an error of less than 5 %. In the absence of the safety-glass pane to be examined the dimensions of the circular shape shall be such that when they are projected they form an array of circles of diameter 
R1 + R2 
R1 
AEx on the screen, where AEx = 4 mm (see Figures 6 and 9). 
9.2.1.2.3. 
Support stand, preferably one permitting vertical and horizontal scanning, as well as rotation of the safety-glass pane. 
9.2.1.2.4. 
Checking template for measuring changes in dimensions where a rapid assessment is desired. A suitable design is shown in Figure 10. 
9.2.1.3. 
Procedure 
9.2.1.3.1. 
General 
Mount the safety-glass pane on the support stand (item 9.2.1.3.2) at the specified rake angle. Project the test image through the area being examined. Rotate the safety-glass pane or move it either horizontally or vertically in order to examine the whole of the specified area. 
9.2.1.3.2. 
Assessment using a checking template 
Where a rapid assessment with a possible margin of error of up to 20 % is sufficient, calculate the value of A (see Figure 10) from the limit value AEáL for the change in deviation and the value of R2, for the distance from the safety-glass pane to the display screen: 
A = 0,145 AEáL · R2 
The relationship between the change in diameter of the projected image AEd and the change in angular deviation AEá is given by: 
AEd = 0,29 AEá · R2 
where: 
AEd is in millimeters, 
A is in millimeters, 
AEáL is in minutes of an arc, 
AEá is in minuts of an arc, 
R2 is in metres. 
9.2.1.3.3. 
Measurements using a photoelectric device 
Where a precise measurement with a possible margin of error of less than 10 % of the limit value is required, measure AEd on the projection axis, the value of the spot width being taken at the point where the luminance is 0,5 times the maximum spot-luminance value. 
9.2.1.4. 
Expression of results 
Evaluate the optical distortion of the safety-glass panes by measuring AEd at any point on the surface and in all directions in order to find AEd max. 
9.2.1.5. 
Alternative method 
In addition, a strioscopic technique is permitted as an alternative to the projection techniques, provided that the accuracy of the measurements given in items 9.2.1.3.2 and 9.2.1.3.3 is maintained. 
9.2.1.6. 
The distance AEx shall be 4 mm. 
9.2.1.7. 
The windscreen shall be mounted at the same rake angle as on the vehicle. 
9.2.1.8. 
The projection axis in the horizontal plane shall be maintained approximately normal to the trace of the windsceen in that plane. 
9.2.2. 
The measurements shall be performed: 
9.2.2.1. 
in the case of category M1 vehicles (a) in Zone A extended to the median plane of the vehicle and in the part of the windscreen corresponding symmetrically to that zone in relation to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle and (b) in zone B; 
9.2.2.2. 
in the case of vehicles in categroies M and N other than M1, in zone I as defined in item 9.2.5.2 in this Annex. 
9.2.2.3. 
Type of vehicle 
The tests shall be repeated if the windscreen is to be mounted on a vehicle of a type which has a different forward field of vision from that of the vehicle type for which the windscreen has already been component type approved.

In the case of windscreens fitted to category M1 vehicles, zones A and B are those defined in Annex II F. 
9.2.5.2. 
In the case of category M and N vehicles other than those in category M1, the zones are defined starting from: 
9.2.5.2.1. 
an ocular point normal to the R point for the driver's seat and 625 mm above that point in the vertical plane parallel to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle for which the windscreen is intended, and passing through the axis of the steering wheel. This point is designated by O below; 
9.2.5.2.2. 
a line OQ, this being the horizontal straight line passing through ocular point O and running normal to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle. 
9.2.5.2.3. 
Zone I - the zone of the windscreen bounded by the intersection of the windscreen with the four following planes: 
P1 - a vertical plane passing through the O point and forming an angle of 15o to the left of the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle; 
P2 - a vertical plane symmetrical to P1 in relation to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle. 
If such an arrangement is impossible (absence of median longitudinal plane of symmetry, for example), the plane symmetrical to P1 in relation to the longitudinal plane of the vehicle passing through the A point is taken to be P2; 
P3 - a plane containing right angle OQ and forming an angle of 10o above the horizontal plane; 
P4 - a plane containing straight line OQ and forming an angle of 8o below the horizontal plane. 
9.2.6.

9.2.6.3. 
A tolerance of up to 6%amp% prime; of an arc is permitted for all parts of zone I or of zone A at least 100 mm from the edges of the windscreen. 
9.2.6.4. 
Slight departures from the requirements are tolerated in zone B, provided that these are localized and mentioned in the test report. 
9.3. 
Secondary-image-separation test 
9.3.1. 
Scope 
Two test methods are recognidzed: 
- target test, and 
- collimator-telescope test. 
These tests may be used for component type-approval, quality control or product evaluation purposes, as appropriate. 
9.3.1.1. 
Target test 
9.3.1.1.1. 
Apparatus 
This method involves viewing an illuminated target through the safety-glass pane. The target may be designed in such a way that the test can be carried out on a simple 'go-no go' basis. The target shall preferably be one of the following types: 
(a) an illuminated 'ring' target whose outer diameter, D, subtends an angle of N minutes of an arc at a point situated at x metres (Figure 11a); or 
(b) an illuminated 'ring and spot' target whose dimensions are such that the distance, D from a point on the edge of the spot to the nearest point on the inside of the ring subtends and angle of n minutes of an arc at a point situated at x metres (Figure 11b); 
where: 
n is the limit value of secondary-image separation, 
x is the distance from the safety-glass pane to the target (not less than 7 m), 
D is given by the formula 
D = x. tan n. 
The illuminated target consists of a light box, approximately 300 × 300 × 150 mm, whose front is most inconveniently constructed of glass masked with opaque black paper or coated with matt black paint. The box shall be illuminated by a suitable light source. The inside of the box shall be coated with matt white paint. 
It may be convenient to use other forms of target such as that shown in Figure 14. It is also acceptable to replace the target system by a projection system and to examine the resulting images on a screen. 
9.3.1.1.2. 
Procedure 
Mount the safety glass pane at the specified rake angle on a suitable stand in such a way that the observation is carried out in the horizontal plane passing through the centre of the target. 
The light box shall be viewed, in a dark or semi-dark room, through each part of the area being examined, in order to detect the presence of any secondary image associated with the illuminated target. Rotate the safety-glass pane as necessary to ensure that the correct direction of view is maintained. A monocular may be used for viewing. 
9.3.1.1.3. 
Expression of results 
Determine whether, 
- when the target is used (see Figure 11a), the primary and secondary images of the circle separate i.e. whether the limit value of n is exceeded, or, 
- when target (b) is used (see Figure 11b), the secondary image of the spot shifts beyond the point of tangency with the inside edge of the circle, i.e. whether the limit value of n is exceeded.

9.3.1.2. 
Collimation-telescope test 
If necessary, the procedure described in this paragraph shall be applied. 
9.3.1.2.1. 
Apparatus 
The apparatus comprises a collimator and a telescope and may be set up in accordance with Figure 19. However, any equivalent optical system may be used. 
9.3.1.2.2. 
Procedure 
The collimation telescope forms, at infinity, the image of a polar coordinate system with a bright point at its centre (see Figure 14). 
In the focal plane of the observation telescope a small opaque spot with a diameter slightly larger than that of the projected bright point is placed on the optical axis, thus obscuring the bright point. 
When a test piece which exhibits a secondary image is placed between the telescope and the collimator a second, less bright, point appears at a certain distance from the centre of the polar coordinate system. The secondary image separation can be read out as the distance between the points seen through the observation telescope (see Figure 14). 
(The distance between the dark spot and the bright spot at the centre of the polar coordinate system represents the optical deviation). 
9.3.1.2.3. 
Expression of results 
The safety glass pane shall first be examined by a simple scanning technique to establish the area giving the strongest secondary image. 
That area shall then be examined by the collimator-telescope system at the appropriate angle of incidence. The maximum secondary-image separation shall then be measured. 
9.3.1.3. 
The direction of observation in the horizontal plane shall be maintained approximately normal to the trace of the windscreen in that plane. 
9.3.2. 
The measurements shall be carried out in accordance with the vehicle categories in the zones as defined in item 9.2.2 above. 
9.3.2.1. 
Vehicle type 
The test shall be repeated if the windscreen is to be mounted on a vehicle of a type which has a forward field of vision different from that of the type of vehicle for which the windscreen has already been component type approved.

9.4. 
Identification-of-colours test 
When a windscreen is tinted in the zones defined in item 9.2.5.1 or 9.2.5.2 four windscreens shall be tested for identifiability of the following colours: 
- white, 
- selective yellow, 
- red, 
- green, 
- blue, 
- amber.

FIRE-RESISTANCE TEST 
10.1. 
Purpose and scope 
This method enables the horizontal burning rate of the materials used in the passenger compartment of motor vehicles (passenger cars, lorries, station wagons, motor buses) to be determined after exposure to a small flame. 
This method permits testing of the materials and coverings used inside vehicles to be tested either individually or in combination up to a thickness of 13 mm. It is used to judge the uniformity of production batches of such materials in respect of their burning behaviour. 
Because of the many differences between the real-world situation and the precise test conditions prescribed herein (application and orientation within a vehicle, conditions of use, ignition sources, etc.) this method cannot be considered to be suitable for evaluation of all true in-vehicle burning characteristics. 
10.2. 
Definitions 
10.2.1. 
Burning rate: the quotient of the burnt distance, measured in accordance with this method, and the time taken to burn at that distance. 
It is expressed in millimetres per minute. 
10.2.2. 
Composite material: a material consisting of several layers of similar or different materials closely held together at their surface by cementing, bonding, cladding, welding, etc. 
When different materials are connected together intermittently (for example by sewing, high frequency welding, riveting, etc.), thus permitting the taking of individual samples in accordance with item 10.5, such materials shall not be considered to be composite materials. 
10.2.3. 
Exposed side: the side which is facing towards the passenger compartment when the material is fitted to the vehicle. 
10.3. 
Principle 
A sample is held horizontally in a U-shaped holder and is exposed to the action of a defined low-energy flame for 15 seconds in a combustion chamer, the flame acting on the free edge of the sample. The test determines whether and when the flame is extinguished, or the time the flame requires to travel over a measured distance. 
10.4. 
Apparatus 
10.4.1. 
Combustion chamber (Figure 15), preferably made of stainless steel, having the dimensions given in Figure 16. 
The front of the chamber contains a flame-proof observation window, which may cover the entire front and which can act as an access panel. 
The bottom of the chamber has vent holes and the top has a vent slot all around. 
The combustion chamber is placed on four feet, 10 mm high. The chamber may have a hole at one end for the introduction of the sample holder containing the sample; in the opposite end a hole is provided for the gas-supply line. Melted material is caught in a pan (see Figure 17) which is placed on the bottom of the chamber between the vent holes without covering any of them. 
10.4.2. 
Sample holder consisting of two U-shaped metal plates or frames of corrosion-proof material. The dimensions are given in Figure 18. 
The lower plate is equipped with pins and the upper one with corresponding holes in order to ensure a consistent holding of the sample. The pins also serve as measuring points at the beginning and end of the burning distance. 
Intervals over the bottom U-shaped frame (see Figure 19). 
The lower side of the sample shall be 178 mm above the floor plate; the distance of the front edge of the sample holder from end of the chamber shall be 22 mm; the distances of the longitudinal sides of the sample holder from the sides of the chamber shall be 50 mm (all inside dimensions) (see Figures 15 and 16). 
10.4.3. 
Gas burner 
The small ignition source is provided by a Bunsen burner having an inside diameter of 9,5 mm. It is so located in the test cabinet that the centre of its nozzle is 19 mm below the centre of the bottom edge of the open end of the sample (see Figure 16). 
10.4.4. 
Test gas 
The gas supplied to the burner shall have calorific value of about 38 MJ/m³ (for example natural gas). 
10.4.5. 
Metal comb, at least 110 mm in length, with seven or eight smooth rounded teeth per 25 mm. 
10.4.6. 
Stop-watch, accurate to 0,5 sec. 
10.4.7. 
Fume cupboard 
The cumbustion chamber may be placed in a fume-cupboard assembly provided that the latter's internal volume is at least 20 times, but not more than 110 times, greater than the volume of the combustion chamber and provided that no single height, width, or length dimension of the fume cupboard is greater than 2¹/2 times either of the other two dimensions. 
Before the test the vertical velocity of the air through the fume cupboard shall be measured 100 mm forward of and to the rear of the ultimate site of the combustion chamber. It shall be between 0,10 and 0,30 m/s in order to avoid possible discomfort to the operator from combustion products. It shall be possible to use a fume cupboard with natural ventilation and an appropriate air velocity. 
10.5. 
Samples 
10.5.1. 
Shape and dimension 
The shape and dimensions of samples are given in Figure 20. The thickness of the sample corresponds to the thickness of the product to be tested. It shall not be more than 13 mm. When sample-taking so permits, the sample shall have a constant section over its entire length. When the shape and dimensions of a product do not permit a sample of a given size to be taken, the following minimum dimensions shall be maintained: 
(a) for samples having a width of 3 to 60 mm, the length shall be 356 mm. In this case the material is tested over the product width; 
(b) for a sample having a width of 60 to 100 mm the length shall be at least 138 mm. In this case the potential burning distance corresponds to the length of the sample, the measurement starting at the first measuring point; 
(c) samples less than 60 mm wide and less than 356 mm long, and samples 60 to 100 mm wide and less than 138 mm long cannot be tested in accordance with the present method, nor can samples less than 3 mm wide. 
10.5.2. 
Sampling 
At least five samples shall be taken from the material under test. In materials having burning rates differing according to the direction of the material (this being established by preliminary tests) the five (or more) samples shall be taken and placed in the test apparatus in such a way that the highest burning rate will be measured. When the material is supplied in set widths a length of at least 500 mm covering the entire width shall be cut. From the piece so cut the samples shall be taken at a point not less than 100 mm from the edge of the material and at points equidistant from each other. 
Samples shall be taken in the same way from finished products when the shape of the product so permits. If the thickness of the product is over 13 mm it shall be reduced to 13 mm by a mechanical process applied to the side which does not face a passenger compartment. 
Composite materials (see item 10.2.2) shall be tested as if they were homogeneous. 
In the case of materials comprising superimposed layers of different composition which are not considered to be composite materials, all the layers of material included within a depth of 13 mm from the surface facing towards the passenger compartment shall be tested individually. 
10.5.3. 
Conditioning 
The samples shall be coditioned for at least 24 hours, but not more than seven days, at a temperature of 23 ± 2 oC and a relative humidity of 50 ± 5 % and be maintained under these conditions until immediately prior to testing. 
10.6. 
Procedures 
10.6.1. 
Place samples with napped or tufted surfaces on a flat surface, and comb twice against the nap using the comb (item 10.4.5). 
10.6.2. 
Place the sample in the sample holder (item 10.4.2) so that the exposed side faces downwards towards the flame. 
10.6.3. 
Adjust the gas flame to a height of 38 mm using the mark on the chamber, the air intake of the burner being closed. The flame shall burn for at least one minute, for stabilization, before the first test is started. 
10.6.4. 
Push the sample-holder into the combustion chamber so that the end of the sample is exposed to the flame, and after 15 seconds cut off the gas flow. 
10.6.5. 
Measurement of the burning time starts at the moment when the foot of the flame passes the first measuring point. Observe the flame propagation on the side (upper or lower) which burns faster. 
10.6.6. 
Measurement of the burning time is completed when the flame has come to the last measuring point or when the flame is extinguished before reaching that point. If the flame does not reach the last measuring point, measure the burnt distance up to the point where the flame is extinguished. The burnt distance is that part of the sample destroyed, on the surface or inside, by burning. 
10.6.7. 
If the sample does not ignite or does not continue burning after the burner has been extinguished, or the flame goes out before reaching the first measuring point, so that no burning time can be measured, note in the test report that the burning speed is 0 mm/min. 
10.6.8. 
When running a series of tests or performing repeat tests make sure before starting a test that the temperature of the combustion chamber and sample holder does not exceed 30 oC. 
10.7. 
Calculation 
The burning rate B, in mm per minute, is given by the formula: 
B = 
s 
t 
× 60 
where: 
s is the burnt distance, in millimetres, 
t is the time, in seconds, taken to burn the distance s. 
10.8. 
Indices of difficulty of the secondary characteristics 
No secondary characteristics are involved.
