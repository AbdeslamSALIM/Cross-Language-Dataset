THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community(1), as last amended by Commission Decision 1999/816/EC(2), and in particular Article 17(3) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In January, the European Commission sent a %quot%note verbale%quot% to all non-OECD countries (plus Hungary and Poland which do not yet apply OECD Decision C(92)39 final). The purpose of this %quot%note verbale%quot% was threefold: (i) to inform these countries of the Community's new regulations; (ii) to ask for confirmation of the respective positions as outlined in the annexes of both regulations; and (iii) to have an answer from those countries which did not reply in 1994. 
(2) Among the countries that replied, the following notified the Commission that the import of certain wastes listed in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 is accepted either without any control procedure or is subject to control pursuant to the control procedure which applies to Annexes III or IV to the said Regulation: 
1. Estonia (reply of 10 February 2000), 
2. Hong Kong (reply of 25 February 2000), 
3. Hungary (reply of 9 February 2000), 
4. Indonesia (reply of 15 Feburary 2000 and further details given on 14 April 2000), 
5. Lithuania (reply of 15 February 2000), 
6. San Marino (reply of 14 February 2000), 
7. Thailand (reply of 17 February 2000). 
(3) In accordance with Article 17(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 259/93, the committee instituted by Article 18 of Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste(3), as last amended by Commission Decision 96/350/EC(4), was notified of the official request of these countries on 26 April 2000. 
(4) In order to take into account the new situation of these countries, it is necessary to amend Commission Regulation (EC) No 1547/1999 of 12 July 1999 determining the control procedures under Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 to apply to to shipments of certain types of waste to certain countries to which OECD Decision C(92)39 final does not apply(5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1208/2000(6),
