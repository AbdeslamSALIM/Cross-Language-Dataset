Commission Decision 
of 26 November 2003 
establishing a model passport for the intra-Community movements of dogs, cats and ferrets 
(notified under document number C(2003) 4359) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2003/803/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to the Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC(1), and in particular the second paragraph of Article 17 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 provides that dogs, cats and ferrets are to be accompanied by a passport when they are moved between Member States. That Regulation also provides for model passports for the movement of those animals to be established. Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 is to apply from 3 July 2004. Directive 92/65/EEC has been amended with a view to implement the same rules to the movements of the animals concerned when traded. 
(2) Accordingly, it is appropriate to establish a model passport that can be used for all movements of dogs, cats and ferrets between the Member States. The model passport should include details of certification requirements regarding anti-rabies vaccinations, as well as the other requirements of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 concerning the health status of those animals. It should also be in a format that can be easily checked by the Competent Authority. 
(3) The model passport should also provide for certifications of other vaccinations, not required under Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 for the movements of dogs, cats and ferrets between Member States, to be included so that the passport provides all the necessary information regarding the health status of the animal in question. 
(4) In addition, the model passport should include a section on clinical examination and legalisation so that the passports can also be used for the movement of those animals outside the Community. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
