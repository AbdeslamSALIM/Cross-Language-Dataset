THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2001/89/EC of 23 October 2001 on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever [1], and in particular Articles 16(1), 25(3) and 29(2) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In 2001 classical swine fever was confirmed in the feral pig population in Luxembourg. 
(2) By Commission Decision 2003/136/EC [2] the Commission approved the plans presented by Luxembourg for the eradication of classical swine fever in the feral pig population and the emergency vaccination of feral pigs. 
(3) By Decision 2005/224/EC the Commission approved the termination of the plan for the emergency vaccination of feral pigs. 
(4) It is apparent from information supplied by Luxembourg that classical swine fever in the feral pig population has been successfully eradicated and that the approved eradication plan no longer needs to be applied. 
(5) It is therefore appropriate to repeal Decision 2003/136/EC. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
