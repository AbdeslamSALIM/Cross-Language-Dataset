Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 723/2004 
of 22 March 2004 
amending the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of other servants of the European Communities 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 283 thereof, 
Having regard to the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities, and in particular Article 13 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, submitted following consultations with the Staff Regulations Committee,(1) 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament,(2) 
Having regard to the Opinion of the Court of Justice,(3) 
Having regard to the Opinion of the Court of Auditors,(4) 
Whereas: 
(1) Since the initial adoption of the Staff Regulations and Conditions of Employment in 1962, substantial advances and innovations in society have occurred. Those advances and innovations should be reflected in the regulatory framework applicable to the European civil service in order to meet the changing needs of the institutions and their staff, whilst respecting a Community administrative culture and tradition based on the principle of service to the citizen. 
(2) The Community should thus be equipped with a high-quality European public administration, so as to enable it to perform its tasks to the highest possible standard in accordance with the Treaties and to meet the challenges, both internal and external, that it will face in the future. 
(3) Consequently, it is necessary to provide a framework for the recruitment by the Community of high calibre staff in terms of productivity and integrity, drawn on the widest possible geographical basis from among citizens of the Member States, and enable such staff to carry out their duties under conditions which ensure that the service functions as smoothly as possible. 
(4) A broader aim should be to ensure that human resources are managed as effectively as possible in a European civil service characterised by competence, independence, loyalty, impartiality and permanence, as well as by cultural and linguistic diversity. 
(5) It is appropriate to ensure that there is a single European civil service and to apply common rules to all institutions and agencies working on behalf of the Community. The availability of a single set of Staff Regulations should provide a useful tool for enhancing cooperation between the institutions and agencies on staff policy, in the interests of the smooth running of the Community and the efficient use of human resources. 
(6) Agencies should be included within the scope of the rules relating to staff, in order to safeguard the harmonious application of the rules and in particular to ensure staff mobility. 
(7) Compliance should be observed with the principle of non-discrimination as enshrined in the EC Treaty, which thus necessitates the further development of a staff policy ensuring equal opportunities for all, regardless of sex, physical capacity, age, racial or ethnic identity, sexual orientation and marital status. 
(8) Officials in a non-marital relationship recognised by a Member State as a stable partnership who do not have legal access to marriage should be granted the same range of benefits as married couples. 
(9) Express reference should be made to measures of a social nature and to working conditions which meet appropriate health and safety standards; such measures are intended to help reconcile work and private life, to promote equality of opportunity, as well as to protect the health and safety of the individual. 
(10) There is a clear need to strengthen the principle of career development based on merit, establishing a closer link between performance and remuneration by providing greater incentives for good performance through structural changes to the careers system, whilst ensuring equivalence of average career profiles between the new and the old structures, in keeping with the establishment plan and budgetary discipline. 
(11) Modernising the careers system calls for greater recognition of officials' professional experience and of the principle of life-long learning. Accordingly it is desirable to replace the existing staff categories and to regrade staff in the new administrators' (AD) and assistants' (AST) function groups, and also to facilitate progress from a lower to a higher group by means of a new certification mechanism. 
(12) The need has arisen to devise a system of ensuring the equivalence of average career profiles which, when viewed as a whole, will offset fairly and reasonably, first, the increase in the total number of grades and, second, the reduction in the number of steps in each grade. 
(13) In order to preserve the multilingual character of the institutions, greater emphasis should, for the purposes of recruitment and promotion, be laid on linguistic proficiency and the ability to work in a third Community language. 
(14) Impartiality is a fundamental principle of public service which is recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union(5). It is therefore vital to clarify the obligations of officials in situations where there is an actual or potential conflict of interest, both before and after leaving the service. 
(15) An improved legal framework should be set up to address issues of psychological and sexual harassment, and to that end clear and appropriate definitions should be formulated. 
(16) Since the right of freedom of expression is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it is appropriate to provide for this basic right of officials, and to set reasonable limits to its exercise. At the same time, clear rules are required to govern the publication of matters connected with the work of the Community, wherever its legitimate interests may be at risk. 
(17) A new legal framework and guarantees should be provided for the legal protection of officials who report possible illegal activity or conduct which constitutes a serious failure to comply with the obligations of Community officials within the service to certain clearly defined persons or bodies. 
(18) It is appropriate to rationalise more consistently the way in which disciplinary proceedings are opened and conducted. There should also be greater stability in the membership of Disciplinary Boards and the rules regarding the suspension of officials should be amended. 
(19) Procedures for monitoring absence and for the submission of medical certificates should be clarified. 
(20) It is necessary to introduce a new legal framework to provide a comprehensive procedure for dealing with cases of professional incompetence which safeguards the right of defence of the officials concerned. Cases of officials who are unable to attain the expected standard of performance within a reasonable time should be dealt with within this new legal framework. 
(21) Provision should be made for the introduction of flexible working arrangements covering in particular, and subject to certain conditions, the right to work part time, to take advantage of job sharing arrangements and to obtain extended leave on personal grounds. Similarly, it is appropriate to introduce provisions on family-related leave and, more particularly, the right to more flexible maternity leave, paternity leave, adoption and parental leave as well as leave in case of serious illness of a family member. 
(22) In the interest of guaranteeing that the purchasing power of Community officials develops in parallel with that of national civil servants in central government of the Member States, it is essential to preserve the principle of a multi-annual adjustment mechanism for pay, known as %quot%the Method%quot%, by extending its application until 31 December 2012 with a review after four years for consistency with budgetary discipline. 
(23) The advantages for officials of a multi-annual pay adjustment system should be balanced by the introduction of a special levy to reflect the costs of social policy, improved working conditions and the European Schools. Such special levy should increase by annual steps and apply to all officials for the same period as the system itself. 
(24) As the costs of the correction coefficients applied to transfers of parts of salary to other Member States have become disproportionate, transfers with correction coefficients should be limited to a lesser proportion of salary and to cases where the transfer is necessary to allow the official to meet expenses resulting from legal obligations to family members in other Member States. 
(25) The criterion for former officials to continue to be covered by the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme has proved uncertain in its application and should therefore be simplified. 
(26) The various allowances should be rationalised, through an overhaul of some allowances and the discontinuation of others, in order to make the administrative rules simpler and more transparent. The reimbursement of travel and mission expenses should thus be brought more closely into line with the real cost, and the administration should be simplified. The education allowance should likewise be aligned more closely, in future, on actual expenditure. 
(27) The system of family allowances needs to be reformed so as to bring about improvements for families and in particular so as to address the problems of parents with young children. 
(28) Since pensions are expressed as a proportion of a final salary, it is appropriate to ensure that in future pay and pensions are adapted in parallel while safeguarding the actuarial basis of the scheme and maintaining the respective shares of contributions borne by the official and the employer and the principle that pensions are a charge on the Community budget. That objective requires the creation of a mechanism for ensuring the short and long-term actuarial balance of the scheme. 
(29) Demographic changes and the changing age structure of the population concerned are imposing ever-increasing burdens upon the Community pension scheme and require that the pension age be increased and the annual rate of accrual of pension rights be reduced, subject however to transitional measures for officials already in service. 
(30) Deepened integration of the European Union and the free choice of pensioners of their place of residence within the European Union has made the system of correction coefficients for pensions obsolete. This system has also created monitoring problems as regards the place of residence of pensioners which should be overcome. This system should therefore be abolished with an appropriate transition for pensioners and officials recruited before the entry into force of this Regulation. 
(31) The conditions underlying the current provisions on invalidity pensions and survivor's pensions have changed since they were first adopted and should therefore be updated and simplified. 
(32) The rules of severance grant should be amended to take into account Community rules on portability of pension rights. This should be achieved by correcting a number of inconsistencies and introducing greater flexibility. 
(33) The rules on the flexible retirement arrangements should take the interests of both officials and the institutions into account and consider the budgetary consequences. The measures involved should depend on the request of the official and be accompanied by appropriate financial conditions; the use of this facility should be reported to the budgetary authority. This provision should be intended to facilitate personnel management in particular in the smaller institutions. A realistic choice in favour of early retirement before reaching pensionable age is dependant on health insurance and family allowances being maintained. However, those measures should be balanced by raising the minimum age to 55 and introducing the option of working beyond the current retirement age. 
(34) The conditions of employment covering overall level of pay and pensions for officials and other servants, remain at a level which attracts and retains the best applicants from all the Member States in an independent and permanent European civil service. 
(35) The provisions applicable to officials in the scientific and technical services and to officials serving in third countries should be adapted, clarified and brought into line with the general provisions. 
(36) A new category of non-permanent staff needs to be established, namely that of contract staff. Such staff, whose responsibilities are of a more limited nature, will generally be required to work under the supervision of officials or temporary staff. They will be employed inter alia with a view to eventually replacing auxiliaries and Category D officials in the institutions, Commission Offices and Representations, Delegations and Agencies and also in executive agencies and other bodies created by a specific legal act. The rights and obligations of such contract staff should be defined by analogy with those of temporary servants, particularly as regards social security, allowances and working conditions. 
(37) Provision should be made for transitional arrangements to enable the new rules and measures to be applied gradually, whilst respecting the acquired rights of the staff in the framework of the Community system before the entering into force of these amendments to the Staff Regulations and taking account of their legitimate expectations. 
(38) The measures, in particular career modernisation measures and financial measures, have been accepted as a whole by the organisations representing staff consulted within the framework of the Consultation Committee established by the Council Decision of 23 June 1981. 
(39) The Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of other servants of the European Communities, laid down in Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2182/2003(7), should therefore be amended accordingly,

%quot%Article 1 
These Staff Regulations shall apply to officials of the Communities.%quot% 
%quot%Article 1a 
1. For the purposes of these Staff Regulations, 'official of the Communities' means any person who has been appointed, as provided for in these Staff Regulations, to an established post on the staff of one of the institutions of the Communities by an instrument issued by the Appointing Authority of that institution. 
2. This definition in paragraph 1 shall also apply to persons appointed by Community bodies to whom these Staff Regulations apply under the Community acts establishing them (hereinafter 'agencies'). Any references to 'institutions' in these Staff Regulations shall apply to agencies, save as otherwise provided in these Staff Regulations.%quot%; 
2) the following Articles are inserted: 
%quot%Article 1b 
Save as otherwise provided in these Staff Regulations, 
(a) the European Economic and Social Committee, 
(b) the Committee of the Regions, 
(c) the European Ombudsman, and 
(d) the European Data Protection Supervisor 
shall, for the purposes of these Staff Regulations, be treated as institutions of the Communities.%quot% 
%quot%Article 1c 
Any reference in these Staff Regulations to a person of the male sex shall be deemed also to constitute a reference to a person of the female sex, and vice-versa, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.%quot%; 
3) the former Article 1a becomes Article 1d and is amended as follows: 
(a) paragraph 1 is replaced by the following: 
%quot%1. In the application of these Staff Regulations, any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age, or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. 
For the purposes of these Staff Regulations, non-marital partnerships shall be treated as marriage provided that all the conditions listed in Article 1(2)(c) of Annex VII are fulfilled.%quot%;

A person with a disability meets the conditions laid down in Article 28(e) if he can perform the essential functions of the job when reasonable accommodation is made. 
'Reasonable accommodation', in relation to the essential functions of the job, shall mean appropriate measures, where needed, to enable a person with a disability to have access to, participate in, or advance in employment, or to undergo training, unless such measures would impose a disproportionate burden on the employer. 
5. Where persons covered by these Staff Regulations, who consider themselves wronged because the principle of equal treatment as set out above has not been applied to them, establish facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination, the onus shall be on the institution to prove that there has been no breach of the principle of equal treatment. This provision shall not apply in disciplinary proceedings. 
6. While respecting the principle of non-discrimination and the principle of proportionality, any limitation of their application must be justified on objective and reasonable grounds and must be aimed at legitimate objectives in the general interest in the framework of staff policy. Such objectives may in particular justify stipulating a mandatory retirement age and a minimum age for drawing a retirement pension.%quot%;

(i) a level of education which corresponds to completed university studies attested by a diploma when the normal period of university education is four years or more, or 
(ii) a level of education which corresponds to completed university studies attested by a diploma and appropriate professional experience of at least one year when the normal period of university education is at least three years, or 
(iii) where justified in the interests of the service, professional training of an equivalent level. 
4. A table showing types of posts is given in Annex I, point A. By reference to this table, each institution shall define the duties and powers attaching to each type of post after consulting the Staff Regulations Committee. 
5. Identical conditions of recruitment and service career shall apply to all officials belonging to the same function group. 
Article 6

These rates shall be applied on a five-year average basis as from 1 May 2004. 
3. The Commission shall, on the basis of the methodology defined in paragraph 5, submit a report to the budgetary authority each year on the evolution of average careers in the two function groups in all institutions, which shall state whether the principle of equivalence has been respected and, if not, to what extent it has been breached. If it has not been respected, the budgetary authority may take such corrective safeguard measures as are appropriate to re-establish equivalence. 
4. To ensure that this system remains consistent with the establishment plan, consistent with the equivalence between the old and the new career structure and consistent with budgetary discipline, the rates laid down in Annex I, point B, shall be reviewed at the end of a five-year period starting on 1 May 2004 on the basis of a report, submitted by the Commission to the Council, and a proposal by the Commission. 
The Council shall decide in accordance with Article 283 of the EC Treaty. 
5. Equivalence shall be assessed, as a result of promotion and seniority over a given reference period on the assumption that staff numbers remain unchanged, between the average career before 1 May 2004 and the average career of officials recruited thereafter.%quot% 
%quot%Article 7 
1. The Appointing Authority shall, acting solely in the interest of the service and without regard to nationality, assign each official by appointment or transfer to a post in his function group which corresponds to his grade. 
An official may apply for a transfer within his institution. 
2. An official may be called upon to occupy temporarily a post in a grade in his function group which is higher than his substantive grade.

The agencies shall be jointly represented in accordance with rules to be fixed by agreement between them and the Commission. 
The Committee shall be consulted by the Commission on all proposals to revise the Staff Regulations; it shall deliver its opinion within the time set by the Commission. In addition to the functions conferred upon the Committee by these Staff Regulations, it may put forward suggestions for revising the Staff Regulations. The Committee shall meet at the request of its Chairman, an institution or the staff committee of an institution.

14) the following Articles are inserted: 
%quot%Article 12a

1. Subject to Article 15, an official wishing to engage in an outside activity, whether paid or unpaid, or to carry out any assignment outside the Communities, shall first obtain the permission of the Appointing Authority. Permission shall be refused only if the activity or assignment in question is such as to interfere with the performance of the official's duties or is incompatible with the interests of the institution. 
2. An official shall notify the Appointing Authority of any changes in a permitted outside activity or assignment, which occur after the official has sought the permission of the Appointing Authority under paragraph 1.

If no such decision is notified within the specified period, the Appointing Authority shall be deemed to have had no objections.%quot%; 
21) Article 18 is replaced by the following: 
%quot%Article 18

(a) repayment of the severance grant paid under Article 12, plus compound interest at a rate of 3,5 % per annum. Where Article 42 or 112 of the Conditions of Employment of other servants has been applied in the case of the official concerned, the latter shall also be required to repay the amount paid under that Article, plus compound interest at the abovementioned rate; 
(b) having an amount set aside for this purpose, before calculation of the credited contribution years provided for in Article 11(2) and providing the official has requested and obtained the application of that Article after resuming service, equal to the part of the amount transferred to the Community pension scheme that corresponds to the actuarial equivalent calculated and transferred to the scheme of origin pursuant to Article 11(1) or Article 12 (1) (b), plus compound interest at a rate of 3,5 % per annum. 
Where Article 42 or 112 of the Conditions of Employment of other servants has been applied in the case of the official concerned, the calculation of the amount to be set aside shall also take account of the amount paid under those Articles, plus compound interest at 3,5 % per annum.

(iii) provisions are included for reversion or survivors' pensions; 
(iv) transfer to another insurance company or other fund will be authorised only if such fund fulfils the conditions laid down in points (i), (ii) and (iii).

The conclusions shall make reference to these comments. 
2. In cases that demand absolute secrecy for the purposes of the investigation and requiring the use of investigative procedures falling within the remit of a national judicial authority, compliance with the obligation to invite the official to comment may, in agreement with the Appointing Authority, be deferred. In such cases, no disciplinary proceedings may be opened before the official has been given a chance to comment. 
3. If, following an OLAF investigation, no case can be made against an official about whom allegations have been made, the investigation in question shall be closed, with no further action taken, by decision of the Director of OLAF, who shall inform the official and his institution in writing.

2. The chairman or a member of the Board shall conduct the investigation on behalf of the Board. For the purposes of the investigation, the Board may call for any documents relating to the matter before it. The institution shall comply with any such request within the time limit, if any, set by the Board. Where such a request is addressed to the official, note shall be taken of any refusal to comply. 
Article 18 
After consideration of documents submitted and having regard to any statement made orally or in writing and to the results of any investigation undertaken, the Board shall, by majority vote, deliver a reasoned opinion as to whether the facts complained of are established and as to any penalty to which those facts should give rise. This opinion shall be signed by all the members of the Board. Each member may attach to the opinion a divergent view. The Board shall transmit the opinion to the Appointing Authority and to the official concerned within two months of the date of receipt of the report of the Appointing Authority, provided that this time limit is commensurate with the degree of complexity of the case.

Section 6 
Suspension 
Article 23 
1. If the Appointing Authority accuses an official of serious misconduct, whether through a failure to honour his professional obligations or through an infringement of the law, it may immediately suspend the person accused of that misconduct for a specified or indefinite period.

4. Sums withheld under paragraph 1 shall be repaid to the official if the final decision imposes a disciplinary penalty no more severe than a written warning, reprimand or deferment of advancement to a higher step, or if no disciplinary penalty is imposed; in the latter case, the repayment shall be made with compound interest at the rate defined in Article 12 of Annex XII.

RULES FOR IMPLEMENTING ARTICLES 64 AND 65 OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS 
CHAPTER 1 
ANNUAL REVIEW OF REMUNERATION PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 65(1) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS 
Section 1 
Factors determining annual adjustments 
Article 1 
1. Report from the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) 
For the purposes of the review provided for in Article 65(1) of the Staff Regulations, Eurostat shall draw up every year before the end of October a report on changes in the cost of living in Brussels, the economic parities between Brussels and certain places in the Member States, and changes in the purchasing power of salaries in national civil services in central government. 
2. Changes in the cost of living for Brussels (Brussels International Index) 
Eurostat shall draw up an index, based on data provided by the Belgian authorities, to measure changes in the cost of living for officials of the Communities in Brussels. This index (hereinafter the %quot%Brussels International Index%quot%) shall take into account the changes between June of the previous year and June of the current year and shall be based on the statistical methodology defined by the Working Group on Article 64 of the Staff Regulations referred to in Article 13. 
3. Changes in the cost of living outside Brussels (economic parities and implicit indices) 
(a) Eurostat shall, in agreement with national statistical institutes or other appropriate authorities in the Member States, calculate the economic parities which establish the equivalence of purchasing power: 
(i) of the salaries of officials of the Communities serving in the capitals of the Member States, except for the Netherlands where The Hague is used instead of Amsterdam, and in certain other places of employment with reference to Brussels, 
(ii) of the pensions of officials paid in the Member States with reference to Belgium. 
(b) The economic parities shall refer to the month of June each year. 
(c) The economic parities shall be calculated in such a way that each basic component can be updated twice per year and checked by a direct survey at least once every five years. Eurostat shall update the economic parities using the most appropriate indices as defined by the Working Group on Article 64 of the Staff Regulations referred to in Article 13. 
(d) Outside Belgium and Luxembourg, changes in the cost of living during the reference period shall be measured by the implicit indices. These indices are calculated by multiplying the Brussels International Index by the change in the economic parity. 
4. Changes in the purchasing power of salaries of national civil servants in central government (specific indicators). 
(a) For the purpose of measuring the percentage change, either upward or downward, in the purchasing power of salaries in the national civil services, Eurostat shall, on the basis of information supplied before the end of September by the national authorities concerned, calculate specific indicators reflecting changes in the real remuneration of civil servants in central government, between the month of July of the previous year and the month of July of the current year. The two should include one twelfth of all annually-paid elements. 
The specific indicators shall take two forms: 
(i) one indicator for each of the function groups, as defined in the Staff Regulations, 
(ii) an average indicator weighted to reflect the number of national civil servants corresponding to each function group. 
Each of these indicators shall be established in real gross and real net terms. For the transition from gross to net, account shall be taken of statutory deductions and general taxation factors. 
To establish the gross and net indicators for the European Union total, Eurostat shall use a sample composed by the following Member States: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands and United Kingdom. The Council, acting on a Commission proposal under Article 65(3) of the Staff Regulations, may adopt a new sample which represents at least 75 % of the European Union GDP and which will apply from the year following its adoption. The results per country shall be weighted in proportion to its national GDP measured using purchasing power parities as shown in the most recent statistics published in accordance with the national accounts definitions in the European System of Accounts currently in force. 
(b) At the request of Eurostat, the appropriate national authorities shall supply it with the additional information which it considers necessary in order to draw up a specific indicator accurately measuring changes in the purchasing power of national civil servants. 
If, after further consultation of the national authorities concerned, Eurostat finds statistical anomalies in the information obtained or finds it impossible to draw up indicators which measure with statistical accuracy the changes in the real income of civil servants in a given Member State, it shall report to the Commission and provide it with all the material it needs to make an assessment. 
(c) Besides the specific indicators, Eurostat shall calculate certain control indicators. One such indicator shall be in the form of data on real per capita emoluments in central government, drawn up in accordance with the national accounts definitions in the European System of Accounts currently in force. 
The Eurostat report on the specific indicators shall be accompanied by comments on the differences between these indicators and the above-mentioned control indicators. 
Article 2 
The Commission shall produce a comprehensive report every three years on the recruitment requirements of the institutions and transmit it to the European Parliament and the Council. On the basis of this report the Commission shall, if necessary, present proposals based on all relevant factors to the Council after consulting the other institutions within the framework of the Staff Regulations. 
Section 2 
Arrangements for the annual adjustment of remuneration and pensions 
Article 3 
1. Under Article 65(3) of the Staff Regulations, the Council, acting on a Commission proposal and on the basis of the criteria set out in Section 1 of this Annex, shall take a decision before the end of each year adjusting remuneration and pensions, with effect from 1 July. 
2. The amount of the adjustment shall be obtained by multiplying the Brussels International Index by the specific indicator. The adjustment shall be in net terms as a uniform across-the-board percentage. 
3. The amount of the adjustment thus fixed shall be incorporated, in accordance with the following method, in the basic salary tables appearing in Article 66 of the Staff Regulations and in Annex XIII to the Staff Regulations and in Articles 20, 63 and 93 of the Conditions of Employment of other servants: 
(a) the net remuneration and net pension without correction coefficient shall be increased or reduced by the annual adjustment referred to above, 
(b) the new table of basic salaries shall be drawn up by calculating the gross amount which, after deduction of tax having regard to paragraph 4 and compulsory deductions for social security and pension contributions, corresponds to the net amount, 
(c) the conversion of net amounts into gross amounts shall be based on the situation of an unmarried official who does not receive the allowances provided for in the Staff Regulations. 
4. For the purposes of applying Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 260/68, the amounts in Article 4 of that Regulation shall be multiplied by a factor composed of: 
(a) the factor resulting from the previous adjustment, and/or 
(b) the rate of adjustment of remuneration referred to in paragraph 2. 
5. No correction coefficient shall be applicable in Belgium and Luxembourg. The correction coefficients applicable: 
(a) to the salaries of officials of the Communities serving in the other Member States and in certain other places of employment, 
(b) by derogation from Article 82(1) of the Staff Regulations, to Community pensions paid in the other Member States for the part corresponding to the acquired rights acquired before 1 May 2004, 
shall be determined on the basis of the ratios between the corresponding economic parities referred to in Article 1 of this Annex and the exchange rates specified in Article 63 of the Staff Regulations for the relevant countries. 
The procedures laid down in Article 8 of this Annex concerning the retrospective application of correction coefficients in places of employment with a high rate of inflation shall apply. 
6. The institutions shall make the corresponding positive or negative adjustment to the remuneration and pensions of the officials, former officials and other persons concerned with retroactive effect for the period between the effective date and the date of entry into force of the decision on the next adjustment. 
If this retroactive adjustment necessitates the recovery of sums overpaid, such recovery may be spread over a period of not more than twelve months from the date of entry into force of the decision on the next annual adjustment. 
CHAPTER 2 
INTERMEDIATE ADJUSTMENTS OF REMUNERATION AND PENSIONS (ARTICLE 65(2) OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS) 
Article 4 
1. Intermediate adjustments of remuneration and pensions pursuant to Article 65(2) of the Staff Regulations, taking effect on 1 January, shall be made in the event of a substantial change in the cost of living between June and December (by reference to the sensitivity threshold defined in Article 6(1) of this Annex) and with due allowance being made for the forecast of the change in purchasing power during the current annual reference period. 
2. The Commission proposal shall be sent to the Council not later than the second half of April. 
3. These intermediate adjustments shall be taken into account in the annual salary adjustment. 
Article 5 
1. In March each year Eurostat shall make a forecast of changes in purchasing power over the period concerned on the basis of the information supplied at the meeting provided for in Article 12 of this Annex. 
If this forecast produces a negative percentage, half of this percentage shall be taken into account in the calculation of the intermediate adjustment. 
2. The change in the cost of living for Brussels shall be measured by the Brussels International Index for the period from June to December of the previous calendar year. 
3. For each place for which a correction coefficient has been set (other than Belgium and Luxembourg), an estimate for December of the economic parities mentioned in Article 1(3) shall be calculated. The change in the cost of living shall be calculated according to the rules set out in Article 1(3). 
Article 6 
1. The sensitivity threshold for the six-month period mentioned in Article 5(2) of this Annex shall be the percentage corresponding to 7 % for a 12 month period. 
2. The threshold shall be applied in accordance with the following procedure, subject to application of the second subparagraph of Article 5(1) of this Annex: 
(a) if the sensitivity threshold is reached or exceeded in Brussels (as measured by the Brussels International Index between June and December), the remuneration for all places shall be adjusted following the annual adjustment procedure, 
(b) if the sensitivity threshold is not reached in Brussels, only the correction coefficients of places where the change in the cost of living (as measured by the implicit indices between June and December) * has exceeded the threshold shall be adjusted. 
Article 7 
For the purposes of Article 6 of this Annex: 
The amount of the adjustment shall be the Brussels International Index, multiplied, where appropriate, by half of the specific indicator forecast if this is negative. 
Correction coefficients shall be the ratio between the relevant economic parity and the exchange rate provided for in Article 63 of the Staff Regulations, multiplied, if the adjustment threshold is not reached for Brussels, by the value of the adjustment. 
CHAPTER 3 
DATE ON WHICH A CORRECTION COEFFICIENT COMES INTO EFFECT (PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT WITH A HIGH COST-OF-LIVING INCREASE) 
Article 8 
1. For places with a high cost-of-living increase (as measured by the change in the implicit indices), the correction coefficient shall come into effect before 1 January in the case of the intermediate adjustment, or 1 July in the case of the annual adjustment. This is so as to bring the loss in purchasing power into line with what it would be in a place of employment where the change in the cost of living corresponded to the sensitivity threshold. 
2. The effective dates for the annual adjustment shall be as follows: 
(a) 16 May for places of employment having an implicit index higher than 6,3 %, and 
(b) 1 May for places of employment having an implicit index higher than 12,6 %. 
3. The effective dates for the intermediate adjustment shall be as follows: 
(a) 16 November for places of employment having an implicit index higher than 6,3 %, and 
(b) 1 November for places of employment having an implicit index higher than 12,6 %. 
CHAPTER 4 
CREATION AND WITHDRAWAL OF CORRECTION COEFFICIENTS (ARTICLE 64 OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS) 
Article 9 
1. The appropriate authorities of the Member States concerned, the administration of an institution of the Communities or the representatives of officials of the Communties in a given place of employment can request the creation of a correction coefficient specific to that place. 
This request should be supported by objective factors revealing an appreciable difference over some years in the cost of living between that place of employment and the capital of the Member State concerned (except for the Netherlands where The Hague is used instead of Amsterdam). If Eurostat confirms that the difference is appreciable (more than 5 %) and sustainable, the Commission should present a proposal to set a correction coefficient for that place. 
2. Likewise the Council shall decide, on a proposal from the Commission, to withdraw the application of a correction coefficient specific to a certain place. In that case the proposal shall be based on one of the following: 
(a) a request by the appropriate authorities of the Member State concerned, the administration of an institution of the Communities or the representatives of officials of the Communities in a given place of employment showing that the cost of living in that place is no longer significantly different (less than 2 %) than that of the capital of the Member State concerned. This convergence should be sustainable and validated by Eurostat, 
(b) the fact that there are no longer any officials and temporary staff of the Communities employed in that place. 
3. The Council shall decide on the proposal in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 64 of the Staff Regulations. 
CHAPTER 5 
EXCEPTION CLAUSE 
Article 10 
If there is a serious and sudden deterioration in the economic and social situation within the Community, assessed in the light of objective data supplied for this purpose by the Commission, the latter shall submit appropriate proposals on which the Council shall act in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 283 of the EC Treaty. 
CHAPTER 6 
ROLE OF EUROSTAT AND RELATIONS WITH THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES IN THE MEMBER STATES 
Article 11 
It shall be the task of Eurostat to monitor the quality of basic data and statistical methods used to work out the factors taken into account for the adjustment of remuneration. In particular, it shall make any assessments or carry out any studies required for such monitoring. 
Article 12 
In March each year Eurostat shall convene a working group composed of experts from the appropriate authorities in the Member States to be known as the %quot%Working Group on Article 65 of the Staff Regulations%quot%. 
At this meeting, the statistical methodology and its implementation concerning specific and control indicators shall be examined. 
The information required to produce a forecast of changes in purchasing power for the purposes of the intermediate adjustment of remuneration shall also be provided, together with the data on working hours in central government departments. 
Article 13 
At least once a year and not later than September, Eurostat shall convene a working group composed of experts from the appropriate authorities in the Member States to be known as the %quot%Working Group on Article 64 of the Staff Regulations%quot%. 
At this meeting, the statistical methodology and its implementation concerning the establishment of the Brussels International Index and economic parities shall be examined. 
Article 14 
At the request of Eurostat, Member States shall inform Eurostat of any factors having a direct or indirect impact on the composition and changes in the remuneration of central government civil servants. 
CHAPTER 7 
FINAL PROVISION AND REVIEW CLAUSE 
Article 15 
1. The provisions of this Annex shall apply from 1 July 2004 to 31 December 2012. 
2. They shall be reviewed at the end of the fourth year particularly in the light of their budgetary implications. To this end, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council and, where appropriate, a proposal to amend this Annex on the basis of Article 283 of the EC Treaty.%quot% 
102) The following Annexes are added: 
%quot%ANNEX XII 
RULES FOR IMPLEMENTING ARTICLE 83A OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS 
CHAPTER 1 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
Article 1 
1. In order to determine the contribution of officials to the pension scheme referred to in Article 83(2) of the Staff Regulations, the Commission shall, every five years starting in 2004, carry out the actuarial assessment of the balance of the pension scheme referred to in Article 83a(3) of the Staff Regulations. This assessment shall indicate whether the contribution of the officials is sufficient to finance one third of the cost under the pension scheme. 
2. In preparation for the examination referred to in Article 83a(4) of the Staff Regulations, the Commission shall every year update this actuarial assessment, having regard to changes in the population as defined in Article 9 of this Annex, in the interest rate as defined in Article 10 of this Annex and in the rate of annual change in the salary scales of EC officials as defined in Article 11 of this Annex. 
3. The assessment and updates shall be carried out in each year n, on the basis of the population of active members of the pension scheme at 31 December of the previous year (n-1). 
Article 2 
1. Any adjustment of the contribution rate shall take effect on 1 July at the same time as the annual adjustment of remunerations under Article 65 of the Staff Regulations. Any adjustment shall not lead to a contribution being more than one percentage point above or below the valid rate of the previous year. 
2. The adjustment taking effect on 1 July 2004 shall not lead to a contribution higher than 9,75 %. The adjustment taking effect on 1 July 2005 shall not lead to a contribution higher than 10,25 %. 
3. The difference established between the adjustment of the contribution rate which would have resulted from the actuarial calculation and the adjustment resulting from the variation referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be recovered at any time, or, consequently, taken into account in subsequent actuarial calculations. The contribution rate which would have resulted from the actuarial calculation shall be mentioned in the assessment report provided for in Article 1 of this Annex. 
CHAPTER 2 
ASSESSMENT OF THE ACTUARIAL BALANCE 
Article 3 
The five-yearly actuarial assessments shall lay down the conditions for balance by taking into account, as charges on the scheme, the retirement pension as defined in Article 77 of the Staff Regulations, the invalidity allowance as defined in Article 78 of the Staff Regulations, survivors' pensions as defined in Articles 79 and 80 of the Staff Regulations. 
Article 4 
1. The actuarial balance shall be assessed on the basis of the method for calculation set out in this chapter. 
2. Under the method, the %quot%actuarial value%quot% of the pension rights earned before the calculation date represents a past service liability, while the actuarial value of the pension rights that will be earned in the year of service beginning on the calculation date represents the %quot%service cost%quot%. 
3. It is assumed that all retirements (except for invalidity) will occur at a fixed average age (r). The average retirement age shall be updated only on the occasion of the five-yearly actuarial assessment referred to in Article 1 of this Annex and may be different for different groups of staff. 
4. In determining the actuarial values: 
(a) the future changes in each official's basic salary between the calculation date and the assumed retirement age shall be taken into account; 
(b) the pension rights earned before the calculation date (the past service liability) shall not be taken into account. 
5. All the relevant provisions provided for in these Staff Regulations (particularly in Annexes VIII and XIII) shall be taken into account in the actuarial evaluation of the service cost. 
6. A smoothing process shall be applied to determine the real discount rate and the rate of annual change in the salary scales of officials of the Communities. The smoothing shall be obtained through a 12-year moving average for the interest rate and for the increase in the salary scales. 
Article 5 
1. The contribution formula is based on the equation: 
%gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% 
2. The contribution of officials to the cost of financing the pension scheme shall be calculated as one third of the ratio between the service cost of the current year (n) for all officials who are active members of the pension scheme and the total annual basic salaries for the same population of active members of the pension scheme at 31 December of the previous year (n-1). 
3. The service cost shall be the sum of: 
(a) the retirement service cost (detailed in Article 6 of this Annex), i.e. the actuarial value of the pension rights that will be earned during year n, including the value of the portion of that pension that will become payable to the surviving spouse and/or dependent children upon the death of the official after retirement (reversion); 
(b) the invalidity service cost (detailed in Article 7 of this Annex), i.e. the actuarial value of the pension rights that will become payable to the active officials who are expected to become invalids during year n; and 
(c) the survivor's service cost (detailed in Article 8 of this Annex), i.e. the actuarial value of the pension rights that will become payable on behalf of active officials who are expected to die during year n. 
4. The evaluation of the service cost shall be based on the pension rights and on the appropriate annuities, as detailed in Articles 6 to 8 of this Annex. 
These annuities shall give the actuarial present value of EUR 1 per year, taking into account the interest rate, the rate of annual change in the salary scales and the probability to be still alive at the age of retirement. 
5. The minimum subsistence figures mentioned in Chapter 2 of Title V of the Staff Regulations and in Annex VIII shall be taken into account. 
Article 6 
1. In order to calculate the value of retirement pensions, the pension rights earned during year n shall be calculated for each active official by multiplying his projected basic salary at retirement by his applicable accrual factor. 
If the cumulated pension rights (rights from the recruitment, including transfers) credited to the official at 31 December of year n-1 are at least 70 % he will deemed not to have acquired any right to pension during year n. 
2. The projected basic salary (PS) at retirement shall be calculated starting from the basic salary at 31 December of the previous year and taking into account the rate of annual increase in the salary scales and the estimated annual rate of increase due to seniority and promotions as follows: 
%gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% 
where: 
SAL= present salary 
GSG= estimated annual rate of General Salary Growth, (the rate of annual change in the salary scales) 
ISP= estimated annual rate of Increase due to Seniority and Promotions 
m= difference between the assumed age of retirement (r) and the official's present age (x) 
Since the calculations shall be made in real terms, net of inflation, the rate of annual change in the salary scales and the annual rate of increase due to seniority and promotions shall be rates of increases net of inflation. 
3. On the basis of the calculation of the pension rights earned by a given official, the actuarial value of those pension rights (and of the reversionary pensions linked to them) shall be calculated by multiplying the annual pension rights as defined above by the sum of: 
(a) an immediate deferred annuity at age x, deferred m years: 
%gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% 
where: 
x= official's age at 31 December of year n-1 
τ= interest rate 
kpx= probability of a person of age x still being alive in k years 
m= difference between the assumed age of retirement (r) and the official's present age (x) 
GSG= estimated annual rate of General Salary Growth, (the rate of annual change in the salary scales) 
ω= ceiling of the mortality table; 
and 
(b) an immediate deferred reversionary annuity at ages x and y, where y is the assumed age of the spouse. This latter annuity shall be multiplied by the probability of the official of being married and by the applicable reversion rate established in accordance with Annex VIII: 
%gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% 
where: 
x= official's age at 31 December of year n-1 
y= age of the official's spouse at 31 December of year n-1 
τ= interest rate 
kpx= probability of an official of age x still being alive in k years 
kpy= probability of a person of age y (spouse of the official of age x) still being alive in k years 
m= difference between the assumed age of retirement (r) and the official's present age (x) 
GSG= estimated annual rate of General Salary Growth, (the rate of annual change in the salary scales) 
ω= ceiling of the mortality table. 
4. The calculation of the service cost for retirement shall take into account: 
(a) the accrual incentive for officials remaining in service after the pensionable age; 
(b) the reduction coefficient for officials leaving the service before the pensionable age. 
Article 7 
1. In order to calculate the value of invalidity allowances, the number of such allowances expected to become payable during year n shall be measured by applying to each active official the probability that he could become an invalid during the year. That probability shall then be multiplied by the annual amount of the invalidity allowances to which the official should become entitled. 
2. In calculating the actuarial value of the invalidity allowances first becoming payable in year n, the following annuities shall be used: 
(a) an immediate temporary annuity at age x: 
%gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% 
where: 
x= official's age at 31 December of year n-1 
τ= interest rate 
kpx= probability of a person of age x still being alive in k years 
m= difference between the assumed age of retirement (r) and the official's present age (x) 
GSG= estimated annual rate of General Salary Growth, (the rate of annual change in the salary scales), 
and 
(b) an immediate reversionary annuity. This latter annuity shall be multiplied by the probability of the official of being married and by the applicable reversion rate: 
%gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% 
where: 
x= official's age at 31 December of year n-1 
y= age of the official's spouse at 31 December of year n-1 
τ= interest rate 
kpx= probability of a person of age x still being alive in k years 
m= difference between the assumed age of retirement (r) and the official's present age (x) 
kpy= probability of a person of age y (spouse of the person of age x) still being alive in k year 
GSG= estimated annual rate of General Salary Growth, (the rate of annual change in the salary scales). 
Article 8 
1. The value of the pension rights that will become payable to survivors during year n shall be measured by applying to each active official the probability that he might die during the year. That probability shall then be multiplied by the annual amount of spouse's pension that will become payable in the current year. The calculation shall take into account the possible orphans' pensions that might become payable. 
2. In calculating the actuarial value of the pension rights that will become payable to survivors during year n, an immediate annuity shall be used. This annuity shall be multiplied by the probability that the official is married: 
%gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% 
where: 
y= age of the official's spouse at 31 December of year n-1 
τ= interest rate 
kpy= probability of a person of age y (spouse of the person of age x) still being alive in k years 
GSG= estimated annual rate of General Salary Growth, (the rate of annual change in the salary scales) 
ω= ceiling of the mortality table. 
CHAPTER 3 
SYSTEM OF COMPUTATION 
Article 9 
1. The demographic parameters to be taken into consideration for the actuarial assessment shall be based on observation of the population of participants in the scheme, comprising staff in active service and pensioners. This information shall be collected annually by the Commission using information received from the different institutions and agencies whose staff are members of the scheme. 
From the observation of this population shall be deduced in particular the structure of the population, the average age of retirement and the invalidity table. 
2. The mortality table shall relate to a population which has characteristics as close as possible to those of the population of members of the scheme. It shall be updated only on the occasion of the five-yearly actuarial assessment referred to in Article 1 of this Annex. 
Article 10 
1. The interest rates to be taken into consideration for the actuarial calculations shall be based on the observed average annual interest rates on the long-term public debt of Member States as published by the Commission. An appropriate consumer price index shall be used to calculate the corresponding interest rate net of inflation as needed for the actuarial calculations. 
2. The effective annual rate to be taken into consideration for the actuarial calculations shall be the average of the real average interest rates for the 12 years preceding the current year. 
Article 11 
1. The annual change in the salary scales of officials to be taken into consideration for the actuarial calculations shall be based on the specific indicators referred to in Article 1(4) of Annex XI. 
2. The effective annual rate to be taken into consideration for the actuarial calculations shall be the average of the net specific indicators for the European Union for the 12 years preceding the current year. 
Article 12 
The rate in Articles 4 and 8 of Annex VIII for the calculation of compound interest shall be the effective rate referred to in Article 10 of this Annex and shall, if necessary, be revised on the occasion of the five-yearly actuarial assessments. 
CHAPTER 4 
IMPLEMENTATION 
Article 13 
1. Eurostat shall be the authority responsible for the technical implementation of this Annex. 
2. Eurostat shall be assisted by one or more qualified independent experts in carrying out the actuarial assessments referred to in Article 1 of this Annex. Eurostat shall provide such experts with, in particular, the parameters referred to in Articles 9 to 11 of this Annex. 
3. Each year on 1 September Eurostat shall submit a report on the assessments and updatings referred to in Article 1 of this Annex. 
4. Any questions of methodology raised by the implementation of this Annex shall be dealt with by Eurostat in cooperation with national experts from the relevant departments of the Member States and the qualified independent expert or experts. Eurostat shall convene a meeting of this group for that purpose at least each year. However, Eurostat may convene more frequent meetings if it feels it necessary.

Article 5 
1. Notwithstanding Article 45 of the Staff Regulations, officials eligible for promotion on 1 May 2004 shall continue to be eligible even if they have not completed a minimum of two years in their grade. 
2. Officials whose names appear before 1 May 2006 on the list of candidates suitable for transfer from one category to another shall, if transfer takes place as from 1 May 2004 be placed in the grade and step they occupied in the former category, or failing this at the first step in the starting grade of the new category. 
3. Articles 1 to 11 of this Annex shall apply to temporary servants engaged before 1 May 2004 who are subsequently recruited as officials in accordance with paragraph 4. 
4. Temporary servants whose names appear before 1 May 2006 on the list of candidates suitable for transfer from one category to another or on the list of successful candidates of an internal competition shall, if recruitment takes place as from 1 May 2004, be placed in the grade and step they occupied as a temporary servant in the former category, or failing this at the first step in the starting grade of the new category. 
5. An official in grade A3 on 30 April 2004 shall, upon appointment after that date as Director, be promoted to the next higher grade, in accordance with Article 7(5) of this Annex. The last sentence of Article 46 of the Staff Regulations shall not apply. 
Article 6 
Without prejudice to Articles 9 and 10 of this Annex, for the first promotion of officials recruited before 1 May 2004, the percentages referred to in Article 6(2) of the Staff Regulations and in Annex I, point B to the Staff Regulations shall be adapted to comply with the arrangements in force in each institution prior to that date. 
Where the promotion of an official takes effect prior to 1 May 2004, it shall be governed by the provisions of the Staff Regulations in force at the date on which the promotion takes effect. 
Article 7 
Basic monthly salaries of officials recruited before 1 May 2004 shall be determined in accordance with the following rules: 
1. The renaming of grades pursuant to Article 2(1) of this Annex shall not lead to any changes in the basic monthly salary paid to each official. 
2. For each official, a multiplication factor shall be calculated at 1 May 2004. This multiplication factor shall be equal to the ratio between the basic monthly salary paid to an official before 1 May 2004 and the applicable amount defined in Article 2(2) of this Annex. 
The basic monthly salary paid to the official on 1 May 2004 shall be equal to the product of the applicable amount and the multiplication factor. 
The multiplication factor shall be applied in order to determine the official's basic monthly salary following advancement in step or adjustment of remunerations. 
3. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, for periods after 1 May 2004 the basic monthly salary paid to an official shall be not less than that he would have received under the system in force before that date through automatic advancement in step in the grade formerly occupied by him. For each grade and step, the former basic salary to be taken into account is equal to the applicable amount after 1 May 2004 multiplied by the coefficient defined in Article 2(2) of this Annex. 
4. An official in grades A*10 to A*16 and AD 10 to 16 respectively who is on 30 April 2004 head of unit, director or director-general, or is subsequently appointed head of unit, director or director general and has performed his new duties satisfactorily during the first nine months, shall be entitled to an increase in the basic monthly salary corresponding to the percentage between the first and the second step in each grade as set out in the tables in Article 2(1) and Article 8(1) of this Annex. 
5. Without prejudice to paragraph 3, for each official, the first promotion after 1 May 2004 shall, depending on the category occupied before 1 May 2004 and the step occupied at the time the promotion takes effect, lead to an increase in basic monthly salary to be determined on the basis of the following table: 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
For the purpose of determining the applicable percentage, each grade shall be divided into notional steps corresponding to two months of service and into notional percentages reduced by one twelfth of the difference between the percentage for the step in question and that for the next higher step with each notional step. 
For the purposes of calculating the salary before promotion of an official who is not in the last step of his grade, the value of the notional step shall be taken into account. For the purposes of this provision, each grade shall also be divided into notional salaries rising by one twelfth of the two-yearly increment for that grade throughout the span of the actual steps. 
6. A new multiplication factor shall be determined upon this first promotion. That multiplication factor shall be equal to the ratio between the new basic salaries resulting from the application of paragraph 5 and the applicable amount in Article 2(2) of this Annex. Subject to paragraph 7, this multiplication factor shall be applied to the salary after advancement in step and adaptation of remunerations. 
7. If, after promotion, the multiplication factor is less than 1, the official shall, by derogation from Article 44 of the Staff Regulations, remain in the first step of his new grade for as long as the multiplication factor remains below 1 or until he is promoted. A new multiplication factor shall be calculated to take account of the value of the advancement in step to which he or she would have been entitled under that Article. Once the factor rises to 1, the official shall start to advance in step in accordance with Article 44 of the Staff Regulations. If the multiplication factor is higher than one, any balance shall be converted into seniority in the step. 
8. The multiplication factor shall be applied upon subsequent promotions. 
Article 8 
1. With effect from 1 May 2006, the grades introduced by Article 2(1) shall be renamed as follows:

3. An official to whom paragraph 1 applies may become a member of the assistants' function group without restriction if he passes an open competition or on the basis of an attestation procedure. The attestation procedure shall be based on the seniority, experience, merit and level of training of officials and the availability of posts in the function group AST. A joint committee shall examine the candidatures of officials for the attestation. The institutions shall adopt rules implementing this procedure before 1 May 2004. Where necessary, specific provision shall be made by the institutions to take account of such change leading to a change in the applicable promotion rates. 
4. With the report provided by the Commission under Article 6(3) of the Staff Regulations, the Commission shall also provide information on the financial implications of the promotion percentages provided for in this Annex and the integration of officials in service before 1 May 2004 into the new career system, including the application of the attestation procedure.

Notwithstanding Article 3 of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations, an official in receipt of a lump-sum payment of education allowance will continue to receive such payment as long as the conditions under which it was granted are fulfilled and at the latest until 31 August 2008. The amounts of the lump-sum payments will, however, be reduced to 80 % of their value of 30 April 2004 on 1 September 2004, to 60 % on 1 September 2005, to 40 % on 1 September 2006, and to 20 % on 1 September 2007.

Beneficiaries who were entitled in the month before 1 May 2004 to the fixed allowance mentioned in the former Article 4a of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations shall keep it ad personam up to grade 6. The amounts of the allowance shall be adjusted every year by the same percentage as the annual pay adjustment referred to in Annex XI of the Staff Regulations. When the net remuneration of an official who has been promoted to grade 7, as a consequence of the abolition of the fixed allowance, is lower than the net remuneration he received, all other conditions being unchanged, in the last month before the promotion, he shall be entitled to a compensatory allowance equal to the difference until his advancement to the next higher step in grade. 
2. Officials in Categories C and D before 1 May 2004 who have not become members of the assistants' function group AST without restriction in accordance with Article 10(3) of this Annex shall continue to be entitled either to compensatory leave or to remuneration, where the requirements of the service do not allow compensatory leave during the month following that in which the overtime was worked, as provided for in Annex VI. 
Article 19 
If, during the transition period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2008, an official's net monthly remuneration, before application of any correction coefficient, is lower than the net remuneration he would have received under the same personal conditions in the month before 1 May 2004, he shall be entitled to a compensatory allowance equal to the difference. This provision shall not apply where the reduction of the net remuneration results from the annual pay adjustment referred to in Annex XI to the Staff Regulations. This net income guarantee shall not cover the effect of the special levy, the changes in the pension contribution rate or the changes in the arrangements for transferring part of the salary. 
Section 4 
Article 20 
1. The pensions of officials who retire before 1 May 2004 shall be subject to the correction coefficient referred to in point (b) of Article 3(5) of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations for Member States in which they have established proven main residence. 
The minimum applicable correction coefficient shall be 100. 
If they establish their residence in a third country, the applicable correction coefficient shall be 100. 
By way of derogation from Article 45 of Annex VIII, the pension of beneficiaries who reside in a Member State shall be paid in the currency of the Member State of residence under the conditions laid down in the second paragraph of Article 63 of the Staff Regulations. 
2. By derogation from the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, from 1 May 2004 until 1 May 2009, pensions determined before 1 May 2004 shall be adjusted by applying the average of the correction coefficients referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 3(5) of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations, used for the Member State in which the pension recipient has established proven main residence. That average shall be calculated on the basis of the correction coefficient shown in the following table: 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
Where at least one of the coefficients in Article 3(5) of Annex XI is amended, so is the average with effect from the same date. 
3. For officials recruited before 1 May 2004 not receiving a pension as at 1 May 2004, the method of calculation of the preceding paragraphs shall apply at the time when pension rights are determined: 
(a) to years of pensionable service within the meaning of Article 3 of Annex VIII acquired before 1 May 2004, and 
(b) to years of pensionable service resulting from a transfer under Article 11 of Annex VIII concerning the pension rights acquired under the system of origin before 1 May 2004 by the official in service before 1 May 2004. 
Their pensions shall be subject to the correction coefficient only if the residence of the official coincides with the country of their place of origin within the meaning of Article 7(3) of Annex VII. However, for family or medical reasons, officials receiving a pension may exceptionally request the Appointing Authority to change their place of origin. This decision shall be taken on production by the official concerned of appropriate supporting evidence. 
By way of derogation from Article 45 of Annex VIII, the pension of beneficiaries who reside in a Member State shall be paid in the currency of the Member State of residence under the conditions laid down in the second paragraph of Article 63 of the Staff Regulations.

However, this Article shall not apply to the beneficiaries of the allowance referred to in Article 41 of the Staff Regulations who reside in the country of their last place of employment. 
Article 21 
Notwithstanding the second sentence of the second paragraph of Article 77, officials who entered the service before 1 May 2004 shall be entitled to 2 % of the salary referred to therein for every year of pensionable service calculated in accordance with Article 3 of Annex VIII. 
Article 22 
1. Officials aged 50 or over or with 20 or more years' service on 1 May 2004 shall become entitled to a retirement pension when they reach the age of 60. 
Officials aged between 30 and 49 years on 1 May 2004 shall become entitled to a retirement pension at the age shown in the table below: 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
Officials aged less than 30 years on 1 May 2004 shall become entitled to a retirement pension at the age of 63 years. 
For officials in service before 1 May 2004 the pensionable age to be taken into consideration for all references to the pensionable age in these Staff Regulations shall be determined in accordance with the above provisions, save as otherwise provided in these Staff Regulations. 
2. Notwithstanding Article 2 of Annex VIII, officials who enter the service before 1 May 2004 * and remain in service after the age at which they would have become entitled to a retirement pension shall be entitled to an increase in the percentage of their basic pension for each year worked after that age, provided that their total pension does not exceed 70 % of final basic salary within the meaning of the second or third paragraph of Article 77 of the Staff Regulations, as the case may be. 
The increase shall also be granted in the event of death, if the official has remained in service beyond the age at which he became entitled to a retirement pension. 
If, pursuant to Annex IVa, an official who enters the service before 1 May 2004 and working part-time contributes to the pension scheme in proportion to the time worked, the increase in pension entitlements provided for in this Article shall be applied only in the same proportion. 
For officials aged 50 years or over or with 20 or more years' service, the increase in pension provided for in the previous subparagraph shall be equal to 5 % of the amount of the pension rights acquired at the age of 60. For officials aged between 40 and 49, the maximum increase in pension shall be 3,0 % of the salary taken into account for calculating the pension, but shall not exceed 4,5 % of the pension rights acquired by those officials at the age of 60. For officials aged between 35 and 39, the maximum increase in the pension shall be 2,75 % of the salary taken into account for calculating the pension, but shall not exceed 4,0 % of the pension rights acquired by those officials at the age of 60. For officials aged between 30 and 34, the maximum pension bonus shall be 2,5 % of the salary taken into account for calculating pension, but shall not exceed 3,5 % of the pension rights acquired by those officials at the age of 60. For officials aged less than 30, the maximum increase in the pension shall be set at 2,0 % of the salary taken into account for calculating the pension. 
3. If in individual exceptional cases the introduction of the new pension provisions leads to an inequitable effect on the pension rights of certain officials to an extent that significantly departs from the average reductions, the Commission shall propose appropriate compensation measures to the Council. The Council shall act on this proposal by the qualified majority provided for in the first indent of Article 205(2) of the EC Treaty. 
4. Officials who entered service before 1 May 2004 and who, after Articles 2, 3 and 11 of Annex VIII have been applied to them, cannot attain at the age of 65 the maximum retirement pension provided for in the second paragraph of Article 77 of the Staff Regulations, may acquire additional pension rights subject to that maximum limit. 
The contributions payable by the officials concerned shall be equivalent to the entire amount of their and their employer's contributions under Article 83(2) of the Staff Regulations. The Commission shall, by means of general implementing provisions, lay down the method for calculating the contributions to be paid by the officials concerned in such a way as to ensure that such acquisition guarantees actuarial balance and the method is applied without financial subsidies from the pension scheme of the European institutions. The Commission shall adopt these general implementing provisions before 1 January 2005. 
The officials concerned may qualify under this arrangement for five years after 1 May 2004, subject to a maximum period of contributions of: three months in the case of officials aged 45 to 49 on 1 May 2004; nine months in the case of officials aged 38 to 44 on that date; fifteen months in the case of officials aged 30 to 37 on that date; and two years in the case of officials aged less than 30 on that date. 
Article 23 
1. Notwithstanding Article 52 of the Staff Regulations, application of the second indent of Article 9 of Annex VIII may be requested by officials who enter the service before 1 May 2004 and who leave the service before the age at which they would have become entitled to a retirement pension in accordance with Article 22 of this Annex: 
(a) from the age of 50 for those aged at least 45 or with 20 or more years' service on 1 May 2004; 
(b) from the age determined in accordance with the table below for officials aged up to 45 years on 1 May 2004: 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
2. In such cases, in addition to the reduction in retirement pension rights referred to in Article 9 of Annex VIII for officials who leave the service at the age of at least 55 years, acquired pension rights shall be further reduced by 4,483 % if receipt of pension commences at the age of 54 years; by 8,573 % if receipt commences at the age of 53 years; by 12,316 % if receipt commences at the age of 52 years; by 15,778 % if receipt commences at the age of 51 years; and by 18,934 % if receipt of retirement pension commences at the age of 50 years. 
Article 24 
1. In the case of a pension determined before 1 May 2004, the recipient's pension entitlement shall continue to be determined after that date in accordance with the rules applied when the entitlement was initially determined. The same holds true as regards cover under the joint sickness insurance scheme. However, the rules on family allowances and correction coefficients in force as from 1 May 2004 shall apply immediately without prejudice to the application of Article 20 of this Annex. 
Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, recipients of an invalidity pension or a survivor's pension may ask to be covered by the provisions applicable as from 1 May 2004. 
2. When these provisions enter into force, the nominal amount of net pension received before 1 May 2004 shall be guaranteed. That guaranteed amount shall nevertheless be adjusted if the recipient's family situation or country of residence changes. For persons who retire between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2007, the nominal amount of net pension received on retirement shall be guaranteed with reference to the Staff Regulations provisions in force on the date of their retirement. 
For the purposes of applying the first subparagraph, if the pension calculated on the basis of the provisions in force is less than the nominal pension as defined below, a compensatory amount equal to the difference shall be granted. 
For recipients of a pension before 1 May 2004, the nominal pension shall be calculated each month taking into account the family situation and the country of residence at the time of calculation, and the Staff Regulations rules in force on the date preceding 1 May 2004. 
For officials who retire between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2007, the nominal pension shall be calculated each month taking into account family situation and country of residence at the time of calculation, and the Staff Regulations rules in force on the date when they retire. 
In the event of the death after 1 May 2004 of a recipient of a pension determined before that date, the survivor's pension shall be determined taking into account the guaranteed nominal pension which the deceased was receiving. 
3. Provided that recipients of an invalidity pension have not asked to be covered by the provisions applicable as from 1 May 2004, and have not been declared fit to resume their duties, their invalidity pensions thus maintained shall be considered retirement pensions when the recipients reach the age of 65 years. 
4. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply to recipients of one of the allowances paid under Articles 41 or 50 of the Staff Regulations or under Regulation (EEC) No 1857/89, Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) 2688/1995, Regulation (EC Euratom, ECSC) No 2689/1995, Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1746/2002, Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1747/2002 or Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1748/2002. However, their retirement pensions shall be determined in accordance with the rules in force on the date on which their payment commences. 
Article 25 
1. For pensions determined before 1 May 2004, the grade used for calculating pension shall be determined in accordance with the tables in Articles 2(1) and 8(1) of this Annex. 
The basic salary taken into account for determining the recipient's pension shall be equivalent to the salary in the table in Article 66 of the Staff Regulations for the new grade thus determined, at the same step, weighted by a percentage equivalent to the ratio of basic salary under the old scale to that under the scale in Article 66 of the Staff Regulations for the same step. 
For steps under the old scale without correspondence in the scale in Article 66 of the Staff Regulations, the last step of the same grade shall be used as the reference for calculating the percentage referred to in the second subparagraph. 
For steps in grade D4 under the old scale, the first step in the first grade shall be used as the reference for calculating the percentage referred to in the second subparagraph. 
2. On a transitional basis, the basic salary within the meaning of Articles 77 and 78 of the Staff Regulations and of Annex VIII shall be determined by applying the corresponding multiplication factor laid down in Article 7 to the salary which corresponds to the recipient's grading taken into account to determine entitlement to retirement pension or invalidity benefit, in accordance with the table in Article 66 of the Staff Regulations. 
For steps under the old scale without correspondence in the scale in Article 66 of the Staff Regulations, the last step in the same grade shall be used as the reference for calculating the multiplication factor. 
For retirement pensions and invalidity benefits determined between 1 May 2004 and 30 April 2006, Article 8(1) shall apply. 
3. For recipients of a survivor's pension, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall apply by reference to the deceased official or former official. 
4. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall apply by analogy to recipients of one of the allowances paid under Articles 41 or 50 of the Staff Regulations or under Regulation (EEC) No 1857/89, Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) 2688/1995, Regulation (EC Euratom, ECSC) No 2689/1995, Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1746/2002, Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1747/2002 or Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1748/2002. 
Article 26 
1. Requests to qualify for the facilities for transfer of pension rights under Article 11(2) of Annex VIII submitted before 1 May 2004 shall be considered in accordance with the rules in force at the time of their submission. 
2. In so far as the time limit stipulated in Article 11(2) of Annex VIII has not yet been exceeded on 1 May 2004, the officials concerned who did not submit such a request within the time limits previously stipulated, or whose request has been rejected for having been submitted after those time limits, shall still be able to submit or resubmit a request for transfer under Article 11(2) of Annex VIII. 
3. Officials who submitted a request for transfer within the time limits but rejected the offer made to them, who did not submit a transfer request within the time limits previously stipulated, or whose request was rejected for having been submitted after those time limits, may still submit or resubmit such a request by 31 October 2004 at the latest. 
4. In the cases provided for in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the institution where the official is working shall determine the number of pensionable years to be taken into account under its own scheme pursuant to the general implementing provisions adopted in respect of Article 11(2) of Annex VIII, which shall take into account the provisions of this Annex. However, for the purposes of paragraph 3 of this Article the official's age and grade to be taken into account shall be those at the time of establishment. 
5. Officials who agreed to transfer their pension rights pursuant to Article 11(2) of Annex VIII before 1 May 2004 may request recalculation of the bonus already obtained under the Community institutions' pension scheme pursuant to that Article. Recalculation shall be based on the parameters in force at the time when the bonus was obtained, adjusted in accordance with Article 22 of this Annex. 
6. Officials who obtain a bonus pursuant to paragraph 1 may, from notification of the bonus under the Community institutions' pension scheme, request application of paragraph 5.

Article 52 of the Staff Regulations shall apply by analogy to recipients of an invalidity allowance. If the recipient of an invalidity allowance retires before the age of 65 without having reached the maximum pension entitlement, the general rules on retirement pensions shall be applied.

If the Invalidity Committee finds that these conditions are no longer fulfilled, the servant shall resume service with the institution, providing his contract has not expired. 
However, if it proves impossible to employ the person concerned in the service of the Communities, the contract may be terminated subject to payment of an amount corresponding to the remuneration that would have been paid during the period of notice and, where applicable, to the compensation for termination of contract provided for in Article 47.

The same entitlement shall apply to children who fulfil the foregoing conditions in the event of death or remarriage of a spouse who is entitled to a survivor's pension. 
Where a servant or a person entitled to a retirement pension or invalidity allowance dies but the conditions set out in the first paragraph are not satisfied, the provisions of the third paragraph of Article 80 of the Staff Regulations shall apply.

Where appropriate, the Commission shall submit a proposal to change after five years the maximum annual number on the basis of Article 283 of the EC Treaty.

The Commission shall, after obtaining the opinion of a committee of experts, lay down such provisions as it deems necessary for applying this Article. 
3. The unemployment allowance shall be set by reference to the basic salary attained by the former member of the contract staff at the time of the termination of his service. The allowance shall be set at:

That contribution shall be set at 0,81 % of the basic salary of the person concerned after deducting a standard allowance of EUR 798,77 and without taking account of the correction coefficients provided for in Article 64 of the Staff Regulations. The contribution shall be deducted each month from the salary of the person concerned and paid, together with the remaining two thirds to be borne by the institution, into a Special Unemployment Fund. This Fund shall be common to the institutions and the latter shall pay their contributions to the Commission each month, no later than eight days after the payment of remunerations.

Article 101 
1. A member of the contract staff who is suffering from total invalidity and who, for that reason, is obliged to suspend employment with the institution shall be entitled, for as long as the invalidity lasts, to an invalidity allowance, the amount of which shall be determined as follows. 
Article 52 of the Staff Regulations shall apply by analogy to recipients of an invalidity allowance. If the recipient of an invalidity allowance retires before the age of 65 without having reached the maximum pension entitlement, the general rules on retirement pensions shall be applied. The amount of the retirement pension shall be based on the salary for the grade and step occupied by the member of the contract staff when he became an invalid. 
2. The invalidity allowance shall be 70 % of the final basic salary of the member of the contract staff. However, it shall not be less than the basic monthly salary of a member of the contract staff in function group I, grade 1, step 1.

3. Where the invalidity of the contract staff member arises from an accident in the course of or in connection with the performance of his duties, from an occupational disease, from a public spirited act or from risking life and limb to save another human being, the invalidity allowance shall not be less than 120 % of the basic monthly salary of a function group I, grade 1, step 1 contract staff member. In such cases the pension contributions shall be borne by the budget of the former employer. 
4. In the case of invalidity deliberately brought about by the contract staff member, the authority referred to in the first paragraph of Article 6 may decide that he should receive only the grant provided for in Article 109. 
5. Persons entitled to an invalidity allowance shall also be entitled to the family allowances provided for in Article 67 of the Staff Regulations in accordance with Annex VII to the Staff Regulations; the household allowance shall be determined on the basis of the recipient's allowance. 
Article 102 
1. Invalidity shall be established by the Invalidity Committee provided for in point (b) of Article 9(1) of the Staff Regulations. 
2. Entitlement to an invalidity allowance shall take effect on the day following that on which the contract staff member's employment is terminated under Articles 47 and 48, which are applicable by analogy.

If the Invalidity Committee finds that these conditions are no longer fulfilled, the contract staff member shall resume service with the institution, providing his contract has not expired. 
However, if it proves impossible to employ the person concerned in the service of the Communities, the contract may be terminated subject to payment of an amount corresponding to the remuneration that would have been paid during the period of notice and, where applicable, to the compensation for termination of contract provided for in Article 47. Article 109 shall also apply.

Article 104 
The right to receive payment of pension shall have effect from the first day of the month following that in which death occurs or, where applicable, on the first day of the month following the period during which the deceased's surviving spouse, orphans or dependants receive his emoluments under Article 70 of the Staff Regulations. 
Article 105 
The surviving spouse of a contract staff member shall be entitled to a survivor's pension in accordance with Chapter 4 of Annex VIII to the Staff Regulations. The pension shall not be less than 35 % of the final basic monthly salary received by the contract staff member, nor less than the basic monthly salary of contract staff in function group I, grade 1, step 1. Where a contract staff member dies, the amount of the survivor's pension shall be increased to 60 % of the retirement pension which the contract staff member would have been paid if he had qualified, irrespective of length of service or of age, for such pension at the time of death. 
A person drawing a survivor's pension shall be entitled, on the conditions laid down in Annex VII to the Staff Regulations, to the family allowances specified in Article 67 of the Staff Regulations.

4. In the event of the death of a former member of the contract staff who leaves the service before reaching 63 years of age and requests that his retirement pension be deferred until the first day of the calendar month following that in which he reaches 63 years of age, children deemed to be his dependants in accordance with Article 2 of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations shall be entitled to an orphan's pension on the same terms as those set out respectively in the foregoing paragraphs. 
5. The orphan's pension of a person treated as a dependent child as defined in Article 2(4) of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations may not exceed twice the dependent child allowance.
