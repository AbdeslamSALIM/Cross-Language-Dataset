Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 
of 30 January 2006 
laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 36, 37 and 299(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament [1], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [2], 
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions [3], 
Whereas: 
(1) The particular geographical situation of the outermost regions imposes additional transport costs in supplying products which are essential for human consumption, for processing or as agricultural inputs. In addition, objective factors arising as a result of insularity and remoteness impose further constraints on economic operators and producers in the outermost regions that severely handicap their activities. In certain cases, operators and producers suffer from double insularity. These handicaps can be alleviated by lowering the price of these essential products. It is therefore appropriate to introduce specific supply arrangements to guarantee supply to the outermost regions and compensate for the additional costs arising from their remoteness, insularity and distant location. 
(2) To that end, notwithstanding Article 23 of the Treaty, imports of certain agricultural products from third countries should be exempt from the applicable import duties. To take account of their origin and the customs treatment accorded to them under the Community provisions, products which have entered the Community's customs territory under inward processing or customs warehousing arrangements should be considered as direct imports, for the purpose of granting the benefits of the specific supply arrangements. 
(3) In order to achieve the goal of lowering prices in the outermost regions and mitigating the additional costs of their remoteness, insularity and distant location while maintaining the competitiveness of Community products, aid should be granted for the supply of products of Community origin to the outermost regions. Such aid should take account of the additional cost of transport to the outermost regions and the prices applied to exports to third countries and, in the case of agricultural inputs and products intended for processing, the additional costs of insularity and distant location. 
(4) Since the quantities covered by the specific supply arrangements are limited to the supply requirements of the outermost regions, those arrangements do not impair the proper functioning of the internal market. Nor should the economic advantages of the specific supply arrangements provoke diversions of trade in the products concerned. Dispatching or exportation of those products from the outermost regions should therefore be prohibited. However, dispatch or exportation of those products should be authorised where the advantage resulting from the specific supply arrangements is reimbursed or, in the case of processed products, to permit regional trade or trade between the two Portuguese outermost regions. Account should also be taken of traditional trade flows with third countries in all the outermost regions, and exports of processed products corresponding to traditional exports for all those regions should accordingly be authorised. Nor should the restriction apply to the traditional dispatching of processed products. For the sake of clarity, the reference period for defining those traditionally exported or dispatched quantities should be specified. 
(5) However, appropriate measures should be taken to allow for the necessary restructuring of the sugar processing sector in the Azores. These measures should take into account that in order for the sugar sector on the Azores to be viable a certain level of production and processing needs to be ensured. Moreover, Portugal will have the means under this Regulation to support local sugar beet production. Against this background, dispatches of sugar from the Azores to the rest of the Community should be allowed exceptionally to exceed traditional flows for a limited period of four years, subject to progressively reduced annual limits. Given that the quantities that may be re-dispatched will be proportional and limited to the extent strictly necessary for ensuring the viability of local sugar production and processing, the temporary dispatching of sugar from the Azores will not adversely affect the internal market of the Community. 
(6) In the case of C sugar to supply the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, the arrangements for exemption from import duties provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2177/92 of 30 July 1992 laying down detailed rules for the application of the specific supply arrangements for the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands with regard to sugar [4] should continue to apply for the period laid down in Article 10(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector [5]. 
(7) To date the Canary Islands have been supplied under the specific supply arrangements with milk-based preparations falling within CN codes 19019099 and CN codes 21069092 intended for industrial processing. Supply of those products should be allowed to continue for a transitional period, pending restructuring of local industry. 
(8) In order to achieve the objectives of the specific supply arrangements, the economic advantages of the arrangements must be in terms of production costs and must cut prices up to the end-user stage. They should therefore be granted only on condition that they are actually passed on, and appropriate checks must be carried out. 
(9) Community policy to assist local production in the outermost regions has involved a multitude of products and measures for their production, marketing or processing. These measures have proved effective and ensured that agriculture continues and develops. The Community should continue to support these lines of production, which are a key factor in the environmental, social and economic equilibrium of the outermost regions. Experience has shown that, as in the case of rural development policy, a closer partnership with the local authorities can help to address the particular issues affecting the regions concerned in a more targeted way. Support for local production should thus continue through general programmes at the most appropriate geographical level, to be submitted by the Member State concerned to the Commission. 
(10) To help achieve the goals of developing local agricultural production and the supply of agricultural products, the level of programming of supplies to the regions concerned should be harmonised and the approach of partnership between the Commission and the Member States should be systematic. The supply programme should therefore be established by the authorities designated by the Member State and submitted to the Commission for approval. 
(11) Farmers in the outermost regions should be encouraged to supply quality products and the marketing of these should be assisted. Use of the graphic symbol introduced by the Community may be useful for that purpose. 
(12) Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) [6] defines the rural development measures eligible for Community support and the conditions for obtaining that support. The structures of certain farms or processing and marketing firms in the outermost regions are seriously defective and face specific difficulties. Provision should accordingly be made for the possibility of derogations for certain types of investment from the provisions restricting the grant of some structural aid provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999. 
(13) Article 29(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 restricts the grant of forestry support to forests and wooded areas belonging to private owners and municipalities and associations thereof. Parts of the forests and wooded areas located in the outermost regions belong to public authorities other than municipalities. Under these circumstances, the conditions laid down in the said Article should be made more flexible. 
(14) Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 and the Annex thereto determine the maximum amounts per year eligible for Community agri-environmental aid. To take into account the specific environmental situation of certain very sensitive pasture areas in the Azores and the preservation of the landscape and traditional features of agricultural land, in particular the areas of terrace cultivation in Madeira, provision should be made for the possibility, in the case of certain specific measures, of increasing those amounts up to twofold. 
(15) A derogation may be granted from the Commission's consistent policy of not authorising State operating aid for the production, processing and marketing of agricultural products covered by Annex I to the Treaty in order to mitigate the specific constraints on farming in the outermost regions as a result of their remoteness, insularity and distant location, small area, mountainous terrain and climate and their economic dependency on a small number of products. 
(16) The plant health of agricultural crops in the outermost regions is subject to particular problems associated with the climate and the inadequacy of the control measures hitherto applied there. Programmes should therefore be implemented to combat harmful organisms, including by organic methods. The Community's financial contribution towards such programmes should be specified. 
(17) The maintenance of vineyards, which are the most widespread type of cultivation in the regions of Madeira and the Canary Islands and a very important one for the Azores, is an economic and environmental imperative. To help support production, neither abandonment premiums nor market mechanisms should be applicable in these regions, but nonetheless, in the Canary Islands, it should be possible to apply crisis distillation measures in the event of exceptional market disturbance arising from quality problems. Similarly, technical and socio-economic difficulties have prevented the complete conversion within the time limits set of the areas in the regions of Madeira and the Azores under vines of hybrid varieties prohibited by the common organisation of the market in wine. The wine produced by such vineyards is intended solely for traditional local consumption. Additional time will allow such vineyards to be converted while preserving a regional economic fabric very heavily reliant upon wine-growing. Portugal should notify the Commission, each year, of the progress made in converting the areas concerned. 
(18) The restructuring of the milk sector is not yet complete in the Azores. In line with the high dependence of the Azores on milk production, combined with other handicaps connected with their distant location and the absence of profitable alternative lines of production, the derogation from certain provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing a levy in the milk and milk products sector [7], introduced by Article 23 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1453/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the Azores and Madeira (Poseima) [8] and renewed by Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2004 [9] should be confirmed with respect to the application of the supplementary levy in the milk and milk products sector in the Azores. 
(19) Support for the production of cow's milk in Madeira has not succeeded in maintaining the balance between domestic and external supply, chiefly because of the serious structural difficulties affecting the sector and its poor capacity to adapt to new economic environments. Consequently, authorisation to produce reconstituted UHT milk from milk powder of Community origin should continue, with a view to covering local consumption more fully. 
(20) The need to maintain local production by means of incentives justifies not applying Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 in the French overseas departments and Madeira. For Madeira this exemption should be subject to a limit of 4000 tonnes, corresponding to the current production of 2000 tonnes and allowing for a reasonable possibility of increased production, estimated at present at a maximum of 2000 tonnes. 
(21) Traditional livestock farming activities should be supported. In order to meet the local consumption needs of the French overseas departments and Madeira, duty-free imports from third countries of male bovine animals intended for fattening should be authorised subject to certain conditions and up to a maximum annual limit. The possibility opened under Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers [10] to enable Portugal to transfer rights to the suckler cow premium from the mainland to the Azores should be renewed and that instrument should be adjusted in line with the new support arrangements for the outermost regions. 
(22) Tobacco growing is of historical importance in the Canary Islands. Economically speaking, tobacco preparation continues to be one of the chief industrial activities in the region. In social terms, tobacco cultivation is very labour-intensive and carried out by small farms. Since the crop is not sufficiently profitable, however, it is in danger of dying out. Tobacco is currently cultivated on only a small area on the island of La Palma, for the small-scale manufacture of cigars. Spain should therefore be authorised to continue to grant aid in addition to Community aid so that this traditional crop can be maintained with a view to supporting the artisanal activity associated with it. In addition, to maintain the manufacture of tobacco products, imports into the Canary Islands of raw and semi-manufactured tobacco should continue to be exempt from customs duty, up to an annual limit of 20000 tonnes of stripped raw tobacco equivalent. 
(23) Implementation of this Regulation must not jeopardise the level of special support from which the outermost regions have benefited up to now. For that reason, so that they can carry out the appropriate measures, the Member States should have at their disposal sums equivalent to the support already granted by the Community under Council Regulation (EC) No 1452/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the French overseas departments (Poseidom) [11], Council Regulation (EC) No 1453/2001 and Council Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the Canary Islands (Poseican) [12] and sums granted to farmers established in those regions under Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal [13], Council Regulation (EC) No 2529/2001 of 19 December 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat [14], Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [15] and sums granted for the supply of rice to the French overseas department of Réunion under Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice [16]. The new system of support for agricultural production in the outermost regions established by this Regulation should be coordinated with the support for the same lines of production in force in the rest of the Community. 
(24) Regulations (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001 and (EC) No 1454/2001 should be repealed. Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 should also be amended to ensure coordination of the respective arrangements. 
(25) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [17]. 
(26) The programmes provided for by this Regulation should start to apply upon notification of their approval by the Commission. To enable the programmes to start at this time, the Member States and the Commission should be permitted to take all the preparatory measures between the date of entry into force of this Regulation and that of the application of the programmes, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
TITLE 1 
SUBJECT 
Article 1 
Subject 
This Regulation lays down specific measures on agriculture to remedy the difficulties caused by the remoteness, insularity, distant location, small surface area, terrain, difficult climate and dependence on a limited number of products of the regions of the Union referred to in Article 299(2) of the Treaty, hereinafter referred to as the "outermost regions". 
TITLE II 
SPECIFIC SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS 
Article 2 
Forecast supply balance 
1. Specific supply arrangements are hereby introduced for the agricultural products listed in Annex I to the Treaty, which are essential in the outermost regions for human consumption, for the manufacture of other products or as agricultural inputs. 
2. A forecast supply balance shall be drawn up stating the quantity of the agricultural products referred to in paragraph 1 needed to meet supply requirements each year. A separate forecast balance may be drawn up for the requirements of undertakings packaging and processing products intended for the local market, for traditional consignment to the rest of the Community or for export as part of regional trade or traditional trade flows. 
Article 3 
Operation of the arrangements 
1. Within the limit of the quantities determined in the forecast supply balance, no duties shall apply to direct imports from third countries into the outermost regions of products covered by the specific supply arrangements. 
Products which have entered the Community's customs territory under inward processing or customs warehousing arrangements shall be considered as direct imports from third countries for the purposes of this Title. 
2. To ensure coverage of the requirements established in accordance with Article 2(2) in terms of price and quality, while taking care to maintain the Community's share in supplies, aid shall be granted to supply the outermost regions with Community products held in public intervention storage or available on the Community market. 
Such aid shall be determined for each type of product concerned to take account of the additional cost of transport to the outermost regions and the prices applied to exports to third countries and, in the case of products intended for processing and agricultural inputs, the additional costs of insularity and distant location. 
3. In implementing the specific supply arrangements, account shall be taken, in particular, of the following: 
(a) the specific requirements of the outermost regions and, in the case of products intended for processing and agricultural inputs, the quality requirements; 
(b) trade flows with the rest of the Community; 
(c) the economic aspect of the proposed aid. 
4. Entitlement under the specific supply arrangements shall be subject to the condition that the economic advantage derived either from exemption from import duties or from aid is actually passed on to the end user. 
Article 4 
Export to third countries and dispatch to the rest of the Community 
1. Products covered by the specific supply arrangements may be exported to third countries or dispatched to the rest of the Community only on conditions laid down under the procedure referred to in Article 26(2). 
Those conditions shall include payment of import duties on the products referred to in Article 3(1) or reimbursement of the aid received under the specific supply arrangements for the products referred to in Article 3(2). 
Those conditions shall not apply to trade flows between French overseas departments. 
2. The restriction provided for in paragraph 1 shall not apply to products processed in the outermost regions from products having benefited from the specific supply arrangements which are: 
(a) exported to third countries or dispatched to the rest of the Community within the limits of traditional exports and traditional dispatches. Those quantities shall be specified by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 26(2), on the basis of the average of exports or dispatches during the years 1989, 1990 and 1991; 
(b) exported to third countries as part of regional trade flows in accordance with destinations and conditions specified under the procedure referred to in Article 26(2); 
(c) dispatched from the Azores to Madeira or vice versa; 
(d) dispatched from Madeira to the Canary Islands or vice versa. 
No export refund shall be granted for the products thus exported. 
3. By way of derogation from paragraph 2(a), the following maximum quantities of sugar (CN code 1701) may be dispatched from the Azores to the rest of the Community for the following years: 
in 2006 : 3000 tonnes, 
in 2007 : 2285 tonnes, 
in 2008 : 1570 tonnes, 
in 2009 : 855 tonnes. 
Article 5 
Sugar 
1. During the period referred to in Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, C sugar referred to in Article 13 of that Regulation, exported in accordance with the relevant provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2670/81 of 14 September 1981 laying down detailed implementing rules in respect of sugar production in excess of the quota [18] and brought in to be consumed in Madeira and in the Canary Islands in the form of white sugar falling within CN code 1701 and to be refined and consumed in the Azores in the form of raw sugar falling within CN code 17011210, shall benefit, under the conditions set out in this Regulation, from the exemption from import duties within the limit of the forecast supply balance referred to in Article 2 of this Regulation. 
2. When determining raw sugar requirements of the Azores, account shall be taken of the development of local production of sugar beet. The quantities covered by the supply arrangements shall be determined so as to ensure that the total volume of sugar refined in the Azores each year does not exceed 10000 tonnes. 
Article 6 
Milk-based preparations 
By way of derogation from Article 2, for the period from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2009 the Canary Islands may continue to receive supplies of milk-based preparations falling within CN codes 19019099 and 21069092 intended for industrial processing of up to 800 tonnes per year and 45 tonnes per year respectively. Aid granted for supplies of those two products from the Community may not exceed EUR 210 per tonne and EUR 59 per tonne respectively and shall be included in the limit laid down in Article 23. 
Article 7 
Imports of rice into Réunion 
No customs duties shall be charged in the French overseas department of Réunion on products falling within CN codes 100610, 100620 and 10064000 imported for consumption there. 
Article 8 
Detailed rules for the application of the arrangements 
Detailed rules for the application of this Title shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 26(2). Such rules shall in particular define the conditions under which the Member States may amend the product quantities and the resources allocated each year to the various products eligible under the specific supply arrangements and, where necessary, establish a system of import licences or delivery certificates. 
TITLE III

Graphic symbol 
1. A graphic symbol shall be introduced with a view to ensuring greater awareness and consumption of quality agricultural products, whether natural or processed, specific to the outermost regions. 
2. The conditions for using the graphic symbol provided for in paragraph 1 shall be proposed by the trade organisations concerned. The national authorities shall forward such proposals, with their opinion, to the Commission for approval. 
Use of the symbol shall be monitored by an official authority or a body approved by the competent national authorities. 
Article 15 
Rural development 
1. Notwithstanding Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, in the case of the outermost regions, the total value of the aid for investments intended in particular to encourage diversification, restructuring or a shift towards sustainable agriculture on agricultural holdings of small economic size, to be defined in the programme complement referred to in Articles 18(3) and 19(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds [21], expressed as a percentage of the volume of eligible investments, shall not exceed 75 %. 
2. Notwithstanding Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, in the case of the outermost regions, the total value of the aid for investments in enterprises engaged in processing and marketing agricultural products consisting mainly of local produce in sectors to be defined in the programme complements referred to in Articles 18(3) and 19(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, expressed as a percentage of the volume of eligible investments, shall not exceed 65 %. The total value of the aid for small and medium-sized enterprises, otherwise subject to the same conditions, shall not exceed 75 %. 
3. The restriction provided for in Article 29(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 shall not apply to tropical or subtropical forests or wooded areas situated in the territory of the French overseas departments, the Azores and Madeira. 
4. Notwithstanding Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, the maximum amounts per year eligible for Community aid, as set out in the Annex to that Regulation, may be increased up to twofold in the case of the measure to protect lakes in the Azores and the measure to preserve the landscape and traditional features of agricultural land, in particular the conservation of stone walls supporting terraces in Madeira. 
5. A description of the measures planned under this Article shall be included, where appropriate, in the programmes for these regions referred to in Articles 18 and 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. 
Article 16 
State aid 
1. For the agricultural products covered by Annex I to the Treaty, to which Articles 87, 88 and 89 thereof apply, the Commission may authorise operating aid in the sectors producing, processing and marketing those products, with a view to mitigating the specific constraints on farming in the outermost regions as a result of their remoteness, insularity and distant location. 
2. Member States may grant additional financing for the implementation of the Community support programmes referred to in Title III of this Regulation. In such cases they must notify the Commission of the State aid and the Commission must approve it in accordance with this Regulation as part of those programmes. Aid thus notified shall be regarded as being notified within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 88(3) of the Treaty. 
Article 17 
Plant health programmes 
1. France and Portugal shall submit programmes to the Commission for the control of organisms harmful to plants or plant products in the French overseas departments and the Azores and Madeira respectively. The programmes shall specify in particular the objectives to be achieved, the measures to be carried out, their duration and their cost. The programmes submitted pursuant to this Article shall not concern the protection of bananas. 
2. The Community shall contribute to the financing of the programmes provided for in paragraph 1 on the basis of a technical analysis of the regional situations. 
3. The financial contribution of the Community provided for in paragraph 2 and the amount of the aid shall be decided in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 26(1) and (3). The measures eligible for Community financing shall be defined in accordance with the same procedure. 
Such contribution may cover up to 60 % of eligible expenditure in the French overseas departments and up to 75 % of eligible expenditure in the Azores and Madeira. Payment shall be made on the basis of documentation provided by the French and Portuguese authorities. If necessary, checks may be organised by the Commission and conducted on its behalf by experts as referred to in Article 21 of Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community [22]. 
Article 18 
Wine 
1. Chapter II of Title II and Chapters I and II of Title III of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine [23] and Chapter III of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 of 31 May 2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine, as regards production potential [24] shall not apply to the Azores and Madeira. 
2. Notwithstanding Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, grapes from prohibited direct-producer hybrid vine varieties (Noah, Othello, Isabelle, Jacquez, Clinton and Herbemont) harvested in the Azores and Madeira may be used for the production of wine which must remain within those regions. 
By 31 December 2013 Portugal shall have gradually eliminated vineyards planted with prohibited direct-producer hybrid vine varieties, with, where appropriate, the support provided for in Chapter III of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. 
Portugal shall notify the Commission, each year, of the progress made in converting and restructuring areas planted with prohibited direct-producer hybrid vine varieties. 
3. Chapter II of Title II and Title III of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 and Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 shall not apply to the Canary Islands, except for the crisis distillation referred to in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, if there is exceptional market disturbance caused by problems of quality. 
Article 19 
Milk 
1. As from the marketing year 1999/2000, for the purposes of sharing the additional levy between the producers referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003, only producers within the meaning of Article 5(c) of that Regulation, established and producing in the Azores, who market quantities exceeding their reference quantity increased by the percentage referred to in the third subparagraph of this paragraph shall be deemed to have contributed to the overrun. 
The additional levy shall be due on quantities exceeding the reference quantity thus increased by the abovementioned percentage, after reallocation of the unused quantities within the margin resulting from this increase among all the producers within the meaning of Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 established and producing in the Azores, and in proportion to the reference quantity available to each producer. 
The percentage referred to in the first subparagraph shall be equal to the ratio between the quantities respectively of 73000 tonnes for the marketing years 1999/2000 to 2004/2005 and 23000 tonnes as from the marketing year 2005/2006 and the total of the reference quantities available on each holding on 31 March 2000. It shall apply only to the reference quantities available on 31 March 2000. 
2. The quantities of milk or milk equivalent marketed which exceed the reference quantities but which comply with the percentage referred to in paragraph 1, after the reallocation referred to in that same paragraph, shall not be taken into account in establishing any overrun by Portugal as calculated in accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003.

Notwithstanding Articles 2 and 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2597/97 of 18 December 1997 laying down additional rules on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products for drinking milk [25], the production in Madeira of UHT milk reconstituted from milk powder originating in the Community shall be authorised within the limits of local consumption requirements, insofar as this measure ensures that locally produced milk is collected and finds outlets. This product shall be used for local consumption only.

The detailed rules shall determine, in particular, the quantity of locally produced fresh milk to be incorporated into the reconstituted UHT milk referred to in the first subparagraph. 
Article 20 
Livestock farming 
1. Until the local numbers of young male bovines reach a level sufficient to ensure the maintenance and development of local beef production in the French overseas departments and Madeira, the possibility shall be introduced of importing bovine animals from third countries, without applying the customs duties referred to in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999, for fattening and consumption in the French overseas departments and Madeira. 
Article 3(4) and Article 4(1) shall apply to animals qualifying for the exemption referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph. 
2. The numbers of animals qualifying for the exemption referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined when the need to import is justified, taking account of the development of local production. These numbers, and detailed rules for the application of this Article, including in particular the minimum duration of the fattening period, shall be fixed in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 26(2). Priority for such animals shall be given to producers keeping animals for fattening at least 50 % of which are of local origin. 
3. Where Article 67 and Article 68(2)(a)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 are applied, Portugal may reduce the national ceiling for sheep and goat payment and suckler cow premium rights. In such case, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 26(2), the corresponding amount shall be transferred from the ceilings set under the abovementioned provisions to the financial resources referred to in the second indent of Article 23(2).
