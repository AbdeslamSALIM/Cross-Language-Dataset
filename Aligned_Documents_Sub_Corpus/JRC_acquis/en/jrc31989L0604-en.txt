***** 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 
of 23 November 1989 
amending Directive 83/183/EEC on tax exemptions applicable to permanent imports from a Member State of the personal property of individuals 
(89/604/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 99 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas, when it adopted Directive 83/183/EEC (4), the Council undertook to adopt unanimously, on a proposal from the Commission, provisions permitting a substantial relaxation and even the removal of the formalities relating to the grant of tax exemptions applicable to permanent imports from a Member State of the personal property of individuals; whereas the ad hoc Committee on a People's Europe, in its first report, endorsed by the Brussels European Council of 29 and 30 March 1985, invited the Commission to present such a proposal; 
Whereas it is necessary to facilitate the free movement of persons within the Community as far as possible; 
Whereas, pending the abolition of tax frontiers required to achieve a true internal market, it is necessary to harmonize and relax certain formalities necessary for the grant of the import exemption provided for in Directive 83/183/EEC, particularly as regards the drawing-up of an inventory of the property and proof of the existence of the normal residence; whereas it is necessary to ease the existing rules relating to the period of use of imported property and to the quantitative limits on certain items,
