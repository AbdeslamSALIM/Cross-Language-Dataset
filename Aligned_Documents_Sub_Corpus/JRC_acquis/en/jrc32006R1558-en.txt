Commission Regulation (EC) No 1558/2006 
of 18 October 2006 
amending Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards the grant of aid for skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder intended for animal feed and the sale of such skimmed-milk powder 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products [1], and in particular Article 15 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 7(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999 [2] fixes the amount of aid for skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder intended for animal feed taking into account the factors set out in Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. In view of the increase in the market price of skimmed-milk powder in the internal market and the increase in the market prices for competing proteins, of the reduction of the supply of skimmed-milk powder and the positive situation of calf prices the amount of aid should be fixed at zero for as long as the current situation persists. 
(2) Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(3) The Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1

(d) EUR 0,00 per 100 kg of skimmed-milk powder with a protein content of not less than 31,4 % but less than 35,6 % of the non-fatty dry extract."
