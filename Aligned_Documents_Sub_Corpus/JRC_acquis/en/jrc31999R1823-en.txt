Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 660/1999(2), and in particular Article 14a thereof,

(2) Whereas, at the request of certain Member States, these groups of high-quality varieties should be determined;
