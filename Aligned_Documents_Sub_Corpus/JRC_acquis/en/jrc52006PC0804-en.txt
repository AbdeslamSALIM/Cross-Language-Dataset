Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, on the other hand 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
The European Community has a longstanding relation with Greenland on fisheries. The current Framework Agreement dates back to 1985 and the present protocol is the Fourth Protocol under the Framework Agreement which expires on 31 December 2006. 
As a consequence of criticism from the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament the Fourth Protocol was significantly modified for the period 2004-2006 aiming at improving the sustainability, financial management and transparency of the Agreement by completely removing a number of quotas, either in accordance with the scientific advice which was against further exploitation or because they were not utilized. Other measures were also introduced and included: a yearly revision of the quotas in light of scientific advice; a Budgetary Support Program (BSP) for the fisheries sector; licence fees paid by the Community ship owners; intensified experimental fisheries and the possibility of transferring fishing possibilities temporarily between Member States in case of under utilisation without prejudice to relative stability. 
The effort leading to the mid-term review also resulted in the Council Conclusions of 24 February 2003 on the Fourth Fisheries Protocol between the Community and Greenland in which the Council stated that the future cooperation between the Community and Greenland should be based on a two-pillar approach with a broader cooperation arrangement in other areas than fisheries and a Fisheries Partnership Agreement. 
The first pillar regarding the broader cooperation arrangement will take the form of a Council Decision and a Joint Declaration providing up to EUR 25 million per year to Greenland on the basis of cooperation in other areas than fisheries. 
As regards the second pillar, i.e. fisheries, the Commission has prepared and conducted negotiations for a Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Greenland in accordance with the Council Conclusions of 24 February 2003 mentioned above, the Council Conclusions of 15 July 2004 on an integrated framework for Fisheries Partnership Agreements with third countries and the negotiating directives for a Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Greenland of 18 July 2005. 
The European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, on the other have with a view to replacing the Fisheries Agreement of 1985 [1] negotiated and initialled on 2 June 2006, a Fisheries Partnership Agreement which provides Community fishermen with fishing opportunities in waters in the exclusive economic zone of Greenland, together with a Protocol and Annex setting out the fishing opportunities, technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of Community vessels during the period of six years from its entry into force. 
The Fisheries Partnership Agreement, accompanied by a Protocol and its Annex, has been signed for a period of six years and remains in force unless terminated. 
The main objective of the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement is to maintain and strengthen the relationship in fisheries between the European Community and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, by creating a framework of partnership and dialogue with a view to improving a sustainable fisheries policy and reasonable exploitation of fisheries resources in Greenlandic fishing zones, in the interests of both parties. The Commission’s negotiating position was based in part on the results of an ex-ante evaluation carried out by independent experts. 
The two parties are taking part in a political dialogue on topics of mutual interest in the fisheries sector. The Fisheries Partnership Agreement supports, in addition to the immediate study and elaboration of a cod management plan, the current priorities of fisheries policy in Greenland: (i) research undertaken by the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources and (ii) the training of fisheries officials. The remaining part of the programme for the sectoral policy will be elaborated in 2006 by Greenland with – where necessary – the assistance of the Commission in order to be agreed by the Joint Committee soon thereafter. 
The Fisheries Partnership Agreement provides also for closer economic cooperation in the fishing industry through the possibility of setting up and development of joint enterprises involving companies from both parties and the promotion of temporary joint ventures in Greenland. 
The Protocol lays down the fishing opportunities for Community vessels, the financial contribution, the categories of fishing activities for Community vessels in the Greenlandic EEZ and the conditions governing them. The Protocol covers a period of six years. 
The financial contribution is fixed at EUR 15,847,244 per year including a financial reserve of EUR 1,540,000 which will be paid in case the Community receives fishing opportunities for cod and/or capelin in addition to the quotas already set out in the Annex. Of the EUR 15,847,244 an annual financial support of EUR 3,261,449 is to be earmarked for defining and implementing a sectoral fisheries policy in Greenland, with a view to continuing the dialogue on responsible and sustainable fishing. 
On top of the financial contribution from the Community budget, the ship owners’ fees, fixed for each species as 5% of the average reference prices set out in Appendix 1, paid to Greenland, could amount to around EUR 2 million. 
The financial contribution for the fishing opportunities in the first protocol under this new Fisheries Partnership Agreement is based on the following changes compared to the modified Fourth Protocol under the Fisheries Agreement from 1985: 
– reduction of the redfish, Greenland halibut East and snow crab quota in accordance with the scientific advice; 
– increase in the quotas of Greenland halibut West of 1,000 tonnes and the shrimp East by 1,325 tonnes; 
– removal of the direct fishery for roundnose grenadier in accordance with scientific advice as well as underutilisation by only allowing by-catches of this species; 
– introduction of a cod quota of 1,000 tonnes in 2007 to be increased to 3,500 tonnes from 2008 and onwards; 
– increase in the by-catch quota due to the introduction of the cod quota and Greenland requirements on by-catch quotas. 
The Commission proposes on this basis that the Council adopt by Regulation this new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, on the other, by Regulation. 
A proposal for a Council Decision concerning the provisional application of the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement is subject to a separate procedure.

Conditions for the exercise of fishing activities by Community vessels in the Greenland EEZ 
A. Licence application and issuing formalities 
1. Ship owners of Community fishing vessels which are interested to make use of the fishing opportunities under this agreement, or their agent, shall no later than 1 December prior to the fishing year notify through electronic transmission to the Commission via the national authorities a list of vessels concerned, containing the data set out in the attached application form. The Community authorities shall transmit forthwith these lists to the Greenland authorities. Any modifications shall be notified in advance in accordance with this procedure. 
Ship owners of Community vessels or their agent shall present to the Community authorities via the national authorities by 1 March or thirty days before the beginning of the fishing trip an application for each vessel wishing to fish under the Agreement. Applications shall be made on the forms provided for that purpose by Greenland, specimens of which are attached. Each licence application shall be accompanied by proof of payment of the fee for the licence’s term of validity. The fees shall include all national and local charges related to access to fishing activities as well as fees imposed by banks for transfers of money. In case a vessel has not paid the bank transfer fee this amount will be required to be paid with the next license application of this vessel and is a precondition for the issuing of a new license. The Greenland authorities will charge an administration fee of one percent of the license fee. 
Community vessels of the same ship owner or agent may submit a collective application for a licence provided that these vessels fly the flag of one and the same Member State. Each licence issued under a collective application shall indicate the total quantity of specimen for which the licence fee has been paid and shall carry the foot-note “maximum quantity to be shared by the vessels…(names of each vessel listed on the collective application)”. 
A collective application must be accompanied by a fishing plan, which gives the aimed quantity for each of the vessels. Any change in the fishing plan shall be communicated at least 3 days before the change takes place to the Greenland authorities with a copy to the European Commission and the national authorities. 
The Community authorities shall present to the Greenland authorities the (collective) application for (a) licence(s) of each vessel wishing to fish under the Agreement. 
The Greenland authorities are entitled to suspend an existing license or not to issue a new license if a Community vessel has not fulfilled the requirements of transmitting relevant logbook sheets and landing declarations to the Greenland authorities in accordance with the catch reporting arrangements. 
2. The Greenland authorities shall communicate, before the entry into force of the Administrative Arrangement, all information concerning the bank accounts to be used for the payment of the fee. 
3. Licences shall be issued for specific vessels and shall not be transferable - subject to the provisions of paragraph 4. Licences shall indicate the maximum quantity authorised to be caught and retained on board. An amendment of any of the maximum quantities indicated in the licence(s) shall be subject to a new application. In the case where a vessel incidentally exceeds any maximum quantity indicated in its licence, it shall pay a fee for the quantity in excess of the maximum quantity indicated in its licence. No new licence is issued to that vessel as long as the fees corresponding to the exceeded quantities are not paid. This fee is calculated in accordance with Part B 2 and thereafter tripled. 
4. However, in the case of force majeure and at the request of the Commission of the European Communities, a vessel’s licence may be replaced by a new licence for another vessel with characteristics similar to those of the first vessel. The new licence shall indicate: 
– the date of issue, 
– the fact that it invalidates and replaces the licence of the previous vessel. 
5. Licences shall be transmitted by the Greenland Fisheries Authority to the Commission of the European Communities within 15 working days of receipt of the application. 
6. The original licence or a copy of it must be held on board at all times and be presented at any time on request of the competent Greenland authorities. 
B. Validity of Licences and Payment 
1. Licences shall be valid from the date of issue to the end of the calendar year in which the licence has been issued. They shall be issued within 15 working days of receipt of the application following payment of the required licence fees per year for each vessel. 
As far as the capelin fishery is concerned, licences shall be issued from 20 June to 31 December and 1 January to 30 April. 
In case Community legislation fixing the fishing opportunities for a given year for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required, has not been adopted by the beginning of the fishing year Community fishing vessels authorised to fish on 31 December in the previous fishing year may continue their activities on the same license in the year for which legislation has not been adopted provided that scientific advice allows for this. A provisional use of 1/12th of the quota per month will be allowed provided that the applicable license fee is paid for the quota. The provisional quota may be adjusted in relation to the scientific advice and the conditions of the specific fishery.

Appendix 2 
Conditions On Issues related to Satellite Tracking of Fishing Vessels 
1. Satellite tracking shall apply to the Parties’ fishing vessels when operating in the waters of the other party. 
Fishing vessels shall be tracked by their Flag State Fisheries Monitoring Centre (FMC) when operating in waters under the jurisdiction of the other Party. 
2. For the purpose of the satellite tracking, the Parties shall exchange consistent latitude and longitude co-ordinates of waters which fall under their jurisdiction. Such co-ordinates shall be without prejudice to other claims and positions of the Parties. The data shall be communicated in computer readable form, as decimal degrees in the WGS-84 datum. 
3. The Vessel Monitoring System hardware and software components shall be tamper proof, i.e. shall not permit the input or output of false positions and shall not be capable of being manually over-ridden. The system shall be fully automatic and operational at all times regardless of environmental conditions. It shall be prohibited to destroy, damage, render inoperative or otherwise interfere with the satellite-tracking device. 
In particular, the masters shall ensure that: 
– data are not altered in any way; 
– the antenna or the antennas connected to the satellite tracking devices are not obstructed in any way; 
– the power supply of the satellite tracking devices is not interrupted in any way; and 
– the satellite tracking devices are not removed from the vessel. 
It shall be prohibited for a Community fishing vessel to enter the Greenlandic EEZ without a functioning satellite tracking device. The Greenland authorities are entitled to suspend with immediate effect the license of Community fishing vessels entering the Greenlandic EEZ without functioning satellite tracking devices. The Greenland authorities shall provide notice without delay to the vessel concerned. The European Commission and the flag Member State shall be notified of the suspension of licenses by the Greenland authorities without delay. 
4. Tracking shall have a position error which shall be less than 500 metres, with a confidence interval of 99%. 
5. When a vessel subject to satellite tracking enters into or exits from waters under the jurisdiction of the other Party, the Flag State shall forward to the relevant FMC of the other Party an Entry or Exit message as described in the Annex. These messages shall be transmitted without delay and based on a preceding tracking on an hourly basis. The tracking frequency by the Flag State FMC of a vessel being in the waters under the jurisdiction of the other Party, shall be on an hourly basis, or more frequent if the Parties so desire. 
6. When a vessel has moved into waters under the jurisdiction of the other Party, the latest position message from the vessel will be communicated from the Flag State FMC to the relevant FMC of the other Party without delay at least every 2 hours. These messages will be identified as Position messages as described in the Annex. 
7. It shall be prohibited for a vessel to switch off its satellite tracking devices when operating in waters under the jurisdiction of the other Party. 
When the satellite tracking device has transmitted hourly messages with the same geographical position for more than 4 hours, a position message containing the activity code "ANC" as described in the Annex may be sent. Such position messages may be transmitted with a frequency of once every 12 hours. Within less than 1 hour after the position has changed, the hourly reporting frequency will resume. 
8. Messages according to paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 shall be in computer readable form, utilising X 25 or other secure protocols, subject to prior agreement between relevant FMCs. 
The X 25 shall be replaced forthwith by HTTPS or other secure protocols as soon as NEAFC has decided on a replacement. 
9. In the event of technical failure or non-function of the satellite tracking device fitted on board a vessel, the master of the vessel shall communicate to his Flag State FMC information according to paragraph 7 in a timely manner. At least one position report per 4 hours shall be sufficient under such circumstances, as long as the vessel stays within the waters under the jurisdiction of the other Party. The Flag State FMC or the vessels shall forward such messages to the FMC of the other Party without undue delay. 
Such faulty equipment shall be repaired or replaced before the vessel commences a new fishing trip. 
Exemptions may be made where it is evident that the equipment cannot be repaired or replaced for reasons outside the control of the master or the owner of the vessel. 
10. The Flag State FMC shall monitor the tracking of its vessels when in the waters under the jurisdiction of the other Party. Information shall be forwarded to the FMC of the other Party without delay in the event that it is discovered that the tracking of vessels does not function as agreed. 
11. In the event that a FMC discovers that information is not being communicated by the other party in accordance with paragraphs 5, 6 and 7, the other Party shall be notified without delay. 
The stored messages shall be transmitted as soon as electronic communication is re-established between the relevant FMCs. 
Communication failures between FMCs shall not affect the operation of the vessels. 
12. Under no circumstances shall tracking data communicated to the other Party in accordance with this Agreement be disclosed to authorities, other than control and monitoring authorities in such a form that the identification of an individual vessel can be derived. 
13. The FMCs of the European Community shall be the Flag State FMC in terms of communicating messages and reports in accordance with paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 from the European Community to Greenland. For the purpose of communicating such reports and messages from Greenland to the European Community, the European Community FMC shall be the FMC of the Member State in whose waters the vessel is or has been operating. The FMC of Greenland is established at the controlling unit of Directorate of Fisheries (Greenland Fisheries Licence Control Authorities) in Nuuk. 
14. The Parties shall exchange information concerning addresses and specifications that shall be used for electronic communication between their FMCs in accordance with paragraphs 5, 6 and 7. Such information shall, to the extent available, also include names, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses that can be useful for general communication between the FMCs. 
15. If a vessel as identified in paragraph 1 flying the flag of one of the Parties is observed within the jurisdiction of the other Part fishing or intending to fish, without having operational satellite tracking device on board and without messages being communicated to that other Party, this vessel may be instructed to leave the waters of that Party. The Parties shall establish routines concerning the exchange of information in order to establish the factual situation causing such lack of messages. This exchange must seek to prevent the wrongful exclusion of vessel. 
16. Repeated failure to comply with the measures hereby provided for may be considered a serious infringement. 
17. The Parties shall review these Conditions as appropriate.

Appendix 4 
Details of implementation for experimental fisheries 
The Home Rule Government of Greenland and the European Commission shall jointly decide on the European Community operators, the most suitable time as well as the arrangements for the implementation of experimental fisheries. In order to facilitate the exploratory work of the vessels, the Home Rule Government of Greenland (through the Greenland Institute of Natural resources) shall provide existing scientific and other basic information. 
The Greenland fishing industry shall be closely associated (co-ordination and dialogue on the arrangements for experimental fisheries). 
Length of the campaigns: maximum six month and minimum three month, unless changed by the parties in agreement. 
Selection of candidates for the implementation of the experimental campaigns: 
The European Commission shall communicate to the Greenland authorities the requests for licences for experimental fishery. A technical dossier specifying: 
– the technical characteristics of the vessel; 
– the level of expertise on the fishery of the ship officers; 
– the proposal for the technical parameters of the campaign (length, gear, exploration regions etc.) 
The Home Rule Government of Greenland shall organise a technical dialogue between the administrations of Greenland and the Community authorities with the ship-owners concerned, if it considers this necessary. 
Before the beginning of the campaign, the vessel owners shall submit to the Greenland authorities and to the European Commission: 
– a declaration of the catches already on board; 
– the technical characteristics of the fishing gear to be used for the campaign; 
– an assurance that they comply with the Greenland Regulations for fisheries; 
During the campaign at sea, the owners of the vessels concerned shall: 
– provide the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, the Greenland authorities and the European Commission with a weekly report on catches per day and by haul, including the description of the campaign’s technical parameters (position, depth, date and time, catches and other observations or comments); 
– communicate the vessel’s position, speed and heading by VMS; 
– ensure the presence on board of one Greenlandic scientific observer or an observer chosen by the Greenland authorities. The role of the observer will be to gather scientific information from the catches, as well as to sample the catches. The observer shall be treated as a ship’s officer and the vessel-owner shall cover the living costs of the observer during his stay on the vessel. The decision on the observer’s time on board, the length of his stay, the boarding and landing harbour will be fixed in agreement with the Greenland authorities. Unless there is agreement between the parties to the contrary, the vessel will never be obliged to put into harbour more than once per two month;

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES 
5.1 Need to be met in the short or long term 
The FPA will provide direct fishing opportunities in Greenland for EC vessels as an integral part of their North Atlantic fishing operations – including North Norway, Svalbard, NAFO, NEAFC and North Sea. 
As part of the EC quotas in Greenland are used to balance the reciprocal fisheries agreements with Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands, indirect fishing opportunities will also be derived for other EC vessels fishing there. 
5.2 Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy 
The FPA aims at maintaining: 
fishing activities by EC fishing vessels in Greenland waters through a binding framework ensuring sustainable and responsible fisheries; 
transfers of quotas to ensure the balance of the EC's fisheries agreements with other third countries in the North Atlantic. 
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework 
The aim of the FPA is to maintain for the period 2007-2012 the access of Community fishing vessels to Greenland waters and resources. 
The annual financial contribution is set at € 15.847.244 including a financial reserve of € 1.540.000 (paid only if additional quantities of cod and capelin are made available to the EC). Of the total contribution € 3.261.449 will be put towards a sectoral fisheries policy programme in Greenland. Under this programme annual amounts are set aside for priority areas already identified: enhancing the research of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources (M€ 0,5) and training of fisheries officials in the Home Rule Government (M€ 0,1). Moreover, in 2007 € 186.022 is set aside for cod management plan studies. The final sectoral programme – including indicators to be measured – will be agreed by the Joint Committee. 
On top of the financial contribution from the EC budget, the ship owners’ fees, paid to the Greenland, could amount to around M€ 2. 
If the scientific advice allows, the fishing opportunities may be increased by mutual agreement. In this case the annual financial contribution will increase proportionally but may not exceed € 31.694.488. 
The following indicators will be used in the context of the ABM for the purposes of monitoring implementation of the agreement: 
the utilisation rate of the fishing opportunities; 
gathering and analysing data on catches and the commercial value; 
contribution to stabilising the EC market; 
number and type of results expected through the use of the financial contribution allocated towards a sectoral fisheries policy programme; 
number of Joint Committees and technical meetings; 
5.4 Method of implementation (indicative) 
X Centralised Management 
X Directly by the Commission 
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
6.1 Monitoring system 
When the Protocol enters into force, the Commission (DG FISH) shall collect the information required for monitoring implementation of the indicators in point 5.3. 
As for the financial contribution for the sectoral fisheries policy programme, the EC and Greenland shall agree, within the Joint Committee, on the content of the programme and on detailed implementing rules, including the criteria and procedures for evaluating the results obtained each year. 
6.2 Assessment 
Independent consultants have drawn up an ex-ante evaluation of a FPA and an ex-post evaluation of the current protocol (January 2006). 
6.2.1 Ex-ante evaluation 
The evaluation identified the following interests for the EC: 
– The study evaluated the impacts of five future renewal scenarios (and variants) on the direct economic benefits (assessed on the basis of a hypothetical estimate of turnover and gross value-added). To continue the current protocol would give a reduced level of benefits (of about M€ 60) to the EC, due to lower profitability of the fishery (higher fuel costs and lower yields). However, the scenario holds a risk of unsustainable levels of exploitation of fish stocks, particularly Greenland Halibut and redfish. 
– A renewal of the Protocol with 1/3 reduction of the fishing opportunities for Greenland Halibut and redfish is considered to give a more sustainable basis for the future. It would imply a modest reduction of 23% in the EC benefits (to M€ 48) and an equal reduction in the contribution (about M€ 10). However, without similar management measures in Icelandic, Faroese and international (NEAFC) waters, where these stocks straddle, the measure would be meaningless in terms of improved environmental sustainability. 
– Finding ways of improving the utilisation of fishing possibilities under the Agreement without prejudice to the principle of relative stability. 
– Reviewing and adapting the current budget support program in the light of progress at the end of the current Protocol, and reprogramming activities according to needs and implementation capacity in Greenland. Improved monitoring arrangements should be introduced, with more specific indicators of achievement. 
As regards Greenland’s interests in the agreement, the main conclusions of the evaluation were: 
Besides the financial contribution which currently constitutes around 6% of Greenland's GNI, Greenland also receives limited payments from EC ship owners to Greenlandic partners for quota rentals through temporary joint ventures. Only one EC vessel infrequently discharges in Greenland, no inputs are purchased from Greenland and only 2 Greenlandic persons are employed on an EC vessel. 
Greenland also benefits from preferential trade arrangements on the condition of a satisfactory Fisheries Agreement. Without these arrangements all Greenland originating products would be imported at erga omnes rates (assuming no other preferential arrangements). Greenland products entering the EU would then incur additional tariffs estimated at a maximum of around M€ 32.5. 
The Greenlandic fishing industry benefits directly from the trade arrangements and indirectly on a long term basis from the budget support through structural adjustments of the fishery sector. 
6.2.2 Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation 
The ex-post evaluation concluded that the main changes introduced in the revision of 4th Protocol (described in the explanatory memorandum) should be retained in a future FPA. 
These measures have been taken into account when negotiating the FPA by continuous reduction of underutilised quotas and adjustment of quotas in line with the scientific advice; an increase in the license fees and maintaining both experimental fisheries and temporary joint ventures. 
6.2.3 Terms and frequency of future evaluation 
Prior to a mid-term review an intermediate evaluation covering 2007-2008 will be carried out to measure the results and the impacts of the indicators listed in point 5.3. Before renewing the protocol an ex-post evaluation will also be carried out covering the entire period of application. 
7. Anti-fraud measures 
The use of the financial contribution paid by the EC under the Agreement is entirely at the discretion of the sovereign third country concerned. 
However, if the results to be achieved under the sectoral programme are not satisfactory (subject to an annual evaluation) then the Commission could request an adjustment in the financial contribution for the programme. 
In any case, any payment by the Commission under a FPA is subject to its standard rules and budgetary and financial procedures. This includes, in particular, identification of the bank accounts of the third countries whereto the financial contribution is paid.
