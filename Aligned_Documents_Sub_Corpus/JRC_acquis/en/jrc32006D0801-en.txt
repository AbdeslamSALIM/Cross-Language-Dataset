THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,

Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption [2], and in particular Article 8(4), Article 9(2)(b) and Article 9(4)(b) and (c) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Certain references to definitions in Commission Decision 2005/432/EC [3] should be updated. 
(2) Since Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin and Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption, are now applicable, it is necessary to amend and update Community health conditions and certification requirements for the importation into the Community of meat products derived from domestic bovines, porcines, ovines, caprines, solipeds, poultry, farmed game, domestic rabbits and wild game. 
(3) The model health certificate should be amended in order to facilitate the operation of Traces established in accordance with Commission Decision 2003/623/EC of 19 August 2003 concerning the development of an integrated computerised veterinary system known as Traces [4]. 
(4) It is appropriate to provide for a transitional period during which certificates issued under the former rules may continue to be used. 
(5) Decision 2005/432/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
