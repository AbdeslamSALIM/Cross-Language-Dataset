Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 of 29 May 1989 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks 
COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) NÂ° 1576/89 of 29 May 1989 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 100a thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas at the moment there are no specific Community provisions governing spirit drinks, in particular as concerns the definition of these products and the requirements relating to their description and presentation; whereas, given the economic importance of these products, it is necessary, in order to assist the functioning of the common market, to lay down common provisions on this subject; 
Whereas spirit drinks constitute a major outlet for Community agriculture; whereas this outlet is largely the result of the reputation which these products have acquired throughout the Community and on the world market; whereas this reputation can be attributed to the quality of traditional products; whereas a certain quality standard should therefore be maintained for the products in question if this outlet is to be preserved; whereas the appropriate means of maintaining this quality standard is to define the products in question taking into account the traditional practices on which their reputation is based; whereas, moreover, the terms thus defined should be used only for products of the same quality as traditional products so as to prevent their being devalued; 
Whereas Community rules should reserve, for certain territories among which certain countries may, by way of exception, appear, the use of geographical designations referring to them, provided that the stages of production during which the finished product acquires its characteristics and definitive properties are completed in the geographical area in question; whereas, by thus conferring exclusive rights on the producers concerned, the Community rules will ensure that the designations in question continue to serve as indications of provenance and will prevent them from entering the public domain and becoming generic terms; whereas the designations in question also perform the function of informing the consumer as to the provenance of products characterized by the raw materials used or by the special processes employed in their manufacture; 
Whereas the normal and customary means of informing the consumer is to include certain information on the label; whereas the labelling of spirit drinks is subject to the general rules laid down in Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (4), as last amended by Directive 86/197/EEC (5); whereas, in view of the nature of the products in question and so that the consumer may have fuller information, specific provisions additional to these general rules should be adopted and whereas, in particular, there should be incorporated, in the definition of products, concepts relating to maturation and minimum alcoholic strength for release for human consumption; 
Whereas, although Directive 79/112/EEC requires the printing of certain particulars on the labelling, it is somewhat lacking in clarity as regards the place of manufacture; whereas this concept is of particular importance in the sector of the drinks concerned owing to the fact that the consumer often makes an association between the drinks in question and the place of its manufacture; whereas the absence of such an indication may give the consumer the impression of a false origin; whereas this danger should be avoided by 
making it obligatory, in certain cases, to state the place of manufacture on the labelling; 
Whereas additional requirements should, in certain cases, also be laid down; whereas, in particular, when ethyl alcohol is used it should be required that it be solely of agricultural origin, as is already customary in the Community, so as to continue to ensure a major outlet for basic agricultural products; 
Whereas Council Directive 80/778/EEC of 15 July 1980 relating to the quality of water intended for human consumption (1), and Council Directive 80/777/EEC of 15 July 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the exploitation and marketing of natural mineral waters(2), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, lay down the characteristics of the water which may be used in foodstuffs; whereas reference should be made thereto: 
Whereas Council Directive 80/388/EEC of 22 June 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to flavourings for use in foodstuffs and to source materials for their production (3) puts forward definitions of various terms liable to be used in connection with flavouring: whereas the same terminology should be used in this Regulation; 
Whereas specific provisions should be adopted concerning description and presentation for imported spirit drinks, bearing in mind the Community's commitments in its relations with third countries; 
Whereas, in order to defend the reputation of Community products on the world market, the same rules should be extended to exported products, except where there are contrary provisions, bearing in mind traditional habits and practices; 
Whereas it is preferable to act by way of a Regulation in order to ensure the uniform and simultaneous implementation of the measures in question; 
Whereas, to simplify and expedite the procedure, the Commission should be entrusted with adopting implementing measures of a technical nature; whereas, for this purpose, provision should be made for a procedure whereby the Member States and the Commission can cooperate closely within an implementation committee; 
Whereas transitional measures are necessary to facilitate the changeover to the system introduced by this Regulation, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Gentian spirit: 
A spirit drink produced from a distillate of gentian, itself obtained by the fermentation of gentian roots with or without the addition of ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin. 
(l) 
Fruit spirit drinks: 
(1) Spirit drinks obtained by macerating fruit in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin and/or in distillate of agricultural origin and/or in spirit as defined in this Regulation and within a minimum proportion to be determined by means of the procedure laid down in Article 15. 
The flavouring of these spirit drinks may be supplemented by flavouring substances and/or flavouring preparations other than those which come from the fruit used. These flavouring substances and flavouring preparations are defined respectively in Article 1 (2) (b) (i) and (c) of Directive 88/388/EEC. However, the characteristic taste of the drink and its colour must come exclusively from the fruit used. 
(2) The drinks so defined shall be called 'spirit drinks' or 'spirit' preceded by the name of the fruit. The cases and conditions in which the name of the fruit may replace those names shall be determined by means of the procedure laid down in Article 15.

(m) 
Juniper-flavoured spirit drinks: 
(1) (a) Spirit drinks produced by flavouring ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin and/or grain spirit and/or grain distillate with juniper (juniperus communis) berries. 
Other natural and/or nature-identical flavouring substances as defined in Article 1 (2) (b) (i) and (ii) of Directive 88/388/EEC and/or flavouring preparations defined in Article 1 (2) (c) of that Directive, and/or aromatic plants or parts of aromatic plants may be used in addition, but the organoleptic characteristics of juniper must be discernible, even if they are sometimes attenuated. 
(b) The drinks may be called Wacholder, ginebra, or genebra. Use of these names is to be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15. 
(c) The alcohols used for the spirit drinks called geniÃ¨vre, jenever, genever and peket, must be organoleptically suitable for the manufacture of the aforementioned products and have a maximum methyl content of 5 grams per hectolitre of 100 % vol alcohol and a maximum aldehyde content expressed as acetaldehyde of 0,2 grams per hectolitre of 100 % vol alcohol. In the case of such products, the taste of juniper berries need not be discernible. 
(2) (a) The drink may be called 'gin' if it is produced by flavouring organoleptically suitable ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin with natural and/or nature-identical flavouring substances as defined in Article 1 (2) (b) (i) and (ii) of Directive 88/388/EEC and/or flavouring preparations as defined in Article 1 (2) (c) of that Directive so that the taste is predominantly that of juniper. 
(b) The drink may be called 'distilled gin' if it is produced solely by redistilling organo- 
leptically suitable ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin of an appropriate quality with an initial alcoholic strength of at least 96 % vol in stills traditionally used for gin, in the presence of juniper berries and of other natural botanicals provided that the juniper taste is predominant. The term 'distilled gin' may also apply to a mixture of the product of such distillation and ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin with the same composition, purity and alcoholic strength. Natural and/or nature-identical flavouring substances and/or flavouring preparations as specified at (a) may also be used to flavour distilled gin. London gin is a type of distilled gin. 
Gin obtained simply by adding essences or flavourings to ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin shall not qualify for the description 'distilled gin'. 
(n) 
Caraway-flavoured spirit drinks: 
(1) Spirit drinks produced by flavouring ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin with caraway (Carum carvi L.).

of Directive 88/388/EEC and/or flavouring preparations as defined in Article 1 (2) (c) of that Directive may additionally be used but there must be a predominant taste of caraway. 
(2) (a) The spirit drinks defined in point 1 may also be called akvavit or aquavit if they are flavoured with a distillate of plants or spices. 
Other flavouring substances specified in the second subparagraph of point 1 may be used in addition, but the flavour of these drinks is largely attributable to distillates of caraway and/or dill (Anethum graveolens L.) seeds, the use of essential oils being prohibited. 
(b) 
The bitter substances must not obviously dominante the taste; the dry extract content may not exceed 1,5 grams per 100 millilitres. 
(o) 
Aniseed-flavoured spirit drinks: 
(1) Spirit drinks produced by flavouring ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin with natural extracts of star anise (Illicium verum), anise (Pimpinella anisum), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), or any other plant which contains the same principal aromatic constituent, using one of the following processes: 
- maceration and/or distillation, 
- redistillation of the alcohol in the presence of the seeds or other parts of the plants specified above, 
- addition of natural distilled extracts of aniseed-flavoured plants, 
- a combination of these three methods. 
Other natural plant extracts or aromatic seed may also be used, but the aniseed taste must remain predominant. 
(2) For an aniseed-flavoured spirit drink to be called 'pastis' it must also contain natural extracts of liquorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra), which implies the presence of the colorants known as 'chalcones' as well as glycyrrhizic acid, the minimum and maximum levels of which must be 0,05 and 0,5 grams per litre respectively. 
Pastis contains less than 100 grams of sugar per litre and has a minimum and maximum anethole level of 1,5 and 2 grams per litre respectively. 
(3) For an aniseed-flavoured spirit drink to be called 'ouzo' it must: 
- have been produced exclusively in Greece, 
( ) - have been produced by blending alcohols flavoured by means of distillation or maceration using aniseed and possibily fennel seed, mastic from a lentiscus indigenous to the island of Chios (Pistacia lentiscus Chia or latifolia) and other aromatic seeds, plants and fruits; the alcohol flavoured by distillation must represent at least 20 % of the alcoholic strength of the ouzo. 
That distillate must: 
- have been produced by distillation in traditional discontinuous copper stills with a capacity of 1 000 litres or less, 
- have an alcoholic strength of not less than 55 % vol an not more than 80 % vol. 
Ouzo must be colourless and have a sugar content of 50 grams or less per litre. 
(4) For an aniseed-flavoured spirit drink to be called anis, its characteristic flavour must be derived exclusively from anise (pimpinella anisum) and/or star anise (illicium verum) and/or fennel (foeniculum vulgare). The name 'distilled anis' may be used if the drink contains alcohol distilled in the presence of such seeds, provided such alcohol constitutes at least 20 % of the drink's alcoholic strength. 
(p) 
Bitter-tasting spirit drinks or bitter: 
Spirit drinks with a predominantly bitter taste produced by flavouring ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin with natural and/or nature-identical flavouring substances as defined in Article 1 (2) (b) (i) and (ii) of Directive 88/388/EEC and/or flavouring preparations as defined in Article 1 (2) (c) of that Directive. 
The drinks may also be marketed as 'amer' or bitter with or without another term. 
This provision shall not affect the possible use of the terms 'amer' for bitter for products not covered by this Article. 
(q) 
Vodka: 
A spirit drink produced by either rectifying ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin or filtering it through activated charcoal, possibly followed by straightforward distillation or an equivalent treatment, so that the organoleptic characteristics of the raw materials used are selectively reduced.
