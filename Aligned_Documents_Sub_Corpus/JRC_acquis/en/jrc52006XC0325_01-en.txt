(2006/C 73/02) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
Cost increases due to the effect of fuel price changes, the change in the Consumer Price Index and aviation fees and fares have prompted airlines to request an increase in the maximum fares stipulated in the Council of Ministers' Agreement of 10 July 1998 applying public service obligations to Canary Island air routes. 
The annex to the abovementioned Agreement provides for the Minister for Internal Development to change the maximum fares in proportion to the rise in costs if the price of costs affecting the operation of these air services rise and at the proposal of the airlines, using the specific procedure in the Annex. 
By virtue of and in accordance with the Agreement, it is hereby decided that: 
The maximum fare set in paragraph 2(1) of the Annex to the Council of Minister's Agreement of 10 July 1998 for each route, on the outward journey, shall be as follows: 
(a) Gran Canaria — Tenerife North: EUR 52 
(b) Gran Canaria — Tenerife South: EUR 52 
(c) Gran Canaria — Fuerteventura: EUR 60
