INTRODUCTION 
1. The European Agency for Reconstruction (hereinafter called the Agency) was established pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1628/96 [1]. This Regulation was replaced by Council Regulation (EC) No 2068/2004 [2]. The Agency, which was actually set up in February 2000, was initially responsible for managing the EU's aid programmes in Kosovo. Following three extensions to its mandate in 2001, 2002 and 2004, its operations now also cover Serbia and Montenegro and the former Yugosla 
v Republic of Macedonia. The Agency's head office is in Thessaloniki and it has operational centres in Belgrade, Podgorica, Pristina and Skopje. It implements programmes to foster institution-building and good governance, to promote the development of a market economy and essential infrastructure and to consolidate civil society. Table 1 summarises the Agency's powers and activities based on information provided by the Agency itself. 
2. For information purposes the annual accounts drawn up by the Agency for the financial year 2004 are summarised in Tables 2, 3 and 4. 
THE COURT'S OPINION 
3. The Court's opinion is addressed to the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with Article 185(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 [3]; it was drawn up following an examination of the Agency's accounts, as required by Article 248 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. 
4. The Agency's accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2004 [4] were drawn up by its Director, pursuant to Article 8(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 [5], and sent to the Court, which is required to give its opinion on their reliability and on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. 
5. The Court conducted an audit in accordance with its policies and standards, which are based on international auditing standards that have been adapted to the Community context. The audit was planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance that the accounts are reliable and the underlying transactions are legal and regular. 
6. The Court has obtained a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed below. 
Reliability of the accounts 
Except for the issue mentioned in paragraph 9, the Agency's accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2004, in all material respects, are reliable. 
Legality and regularity of underlying transactions 
Except for the issue mentioned in paragraph 11, the transactions underlying the Agency's accounts, taken as a whole, are legal and regular. 
OBSERVATIONS 
7. Although significant funds were maintained throughout the year [6], the Agency has no active treasury management policy in place; considerable amounts are maintained on current bank accounts without their earnings being checked by the Agency. 
8. Reconciliations between bank accounts and the Agency's accounting records are not regularly carried out. With the introduction of accruals accounting in 2005, it is even more relevant that bank accounts be reconciled with the accounting records on a monthly basis. 
9. In the absence of effective internal control procedures for long-term receivables the Court cannot be certain that the transactions relating to counterpart funds, credit line schemes and special funds have been completely recorded. 
10. One of the main problems the Agency faces is the difficulty in recruiting agents capable of carrying out the difficult tasks with which it is entrusted. The policy of renewing the mandate of the Agency for short periods of time increases this problem as very few individuals with the required profile will relocate under these circumstances. 
11. In its 2003 report [7], the Court noted anomalies which had affected decisions in awarding contracts. In 2004 this situation was again observed. Tenders are the subject of formal procedures which constitute the main guarantee against unequal treatment between tenderers. It is therefore essential to ensure that procedures are strictly applied. Many of the difficulties encountered were due to the fact that criteria set in calls for tender were open to interpretation because they were unsuited to the practical situation. The Agency should thus be particularly attentive when setting selection criteria to avoid unrealistic requirements which would later lead to interpretation and ineffective procedures. 
12. A review of operations entrusted to the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) was carried out. It has covered all 16 operations still open in the Agency's accounts totalling 30,7 million euro (2004 payments 2,5 million euro). In those cases where UNMIK is directly managing the contracts, the Agency made payments without exercising adequate financial control. The frequent absence of audit trail requires an in-depth review of the applicability of the agreement [8] signed between the Commission and the United Nations. 
13. In the cases of funds where UNMIK was acting on behalf of the local government departments, the management of these operations was entirely left to these departments. The Agency has not paid sufficient attention to the proper financial organisation of the beneficiaries because it assumed this was the legal responsibility of UNMIK and was then faced with serious difficulties in closing the operations mainly due to an absence of adequate accounts for the projects and of sufficient justification for the expenditure. 
14. Concerning supporting documentation for payments, a standardised system of dealing with payment requests needs to be adopted and criteria set on the kind of supporting evidence that is necessary for a payment to be made. 
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg at its meeting of 10 November 2005.

THE AGENCY'S REPLIES 
7. The funds available in the Agency's bank accounts are commensurate with its disbursement needs, taking into account that payments may reach peaks of 45 million euro in a single month and that there was in December 2004 a total outstanding amount of 345 million euro to be paid on contracted funds. Disruption in treasury due to delays in receiving the requested tranches of the EC subsidy also needs to be avoided. The Agency follows a treasury policy in line with the Commission's practice. Following the Court's observation, guidance from DG Budget will be sought. Recovery orders are issued to ensure proper recording in the accounts. In 2004, 2,9 million euro was earned on the EAR bank accounts. 
8. Bank reconciliations were frequently carried out by the Agency before the introduction of the new double entry computerised accounting tool in mid-2004. The Agency agrees to perform them on a monthly basis. 
9. In accordance with its commitments taken in the context of the 2003 discharge procedure, the Agency has entered in the final 2004 accounts the original value of the investment less a provision for bad debts for all counterpart funds and credit line schemes and the unspent amount for special funds. All of these activities have undergone or are undergoing external audits in 2005. The Agency considers that the accounts provide a fair and complete view of the EAR long term receivables. Any minor adaptation needed will be made in the 2005 balance. 
11. The Agency operates under difficult circumstances in a demanding environment and is fully aware of the risk involved in managing substantial amounts of assistance under such conditions. It therefore established an elaborated procurement system with clear division of tasks amongst its operational, procurement and finance staff. The EAR has taken appropriate measures to address the issues raised by the Court in its annual report for 2003 finalised and published end of 2004; thus the improvements could not be visible in 2004 but will be appreciated in the context of the audit for the 2005 exercise. The EAR in particular provided central guidance to the actors involved in calls for tenders across the Agency and improved the coherence of applicable standards and approaches. Such efforts will continue in order to ensure that the relevant recommendations of the Court are complied with. 
12. The Agency attempts by all means to ensure that UNMIK respects its relevant obligations. The EAR's policy is to insist in particular on receiving in due time and form the reports provided for in the contracts, and to reject them if inappropriate. No further payments are made without checking the financial data and documents required. The EAR also funds audits at the most appropriate stage of implementation, normally in view of, or immediately after, the closure of a contract. These audits are "subject to the internal and external auditing procedures laid down in the Financial Regulations, rules and directives of the United Nations" as stipulated in Article 1(a) of the FAFA. 
13. The terms of the EAR grant agreements with UNMIK are clear on the respective shares of responsibility. UNMIK is the responsible organisation regarding government departments. Conscious of the difficulties mentioned, the Agency provided technical and financial advice in the framework of certain grant agreements. This practice will be further extended in future. The Agency's final payments to UNMIK are conditional to the respect of financial requirements, based on reports by independent auditors. 
14. The Agency uses a workflow (financial circuit) with two verifications prior to authorisation and standard checklists. An Instruction Note with the detailed procedure for processing invoices was updated in mid-2004. Efforts to further strengthen and standardise these rules will continue.
