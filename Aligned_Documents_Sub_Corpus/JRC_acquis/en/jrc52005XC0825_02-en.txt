Aid No: N 562/2004. 
Title: Aid for the costs of transporting fallen stock. 
Objective: With letter of 13 May 2002 (SG(2002)D/229773, aid case N 4/2002) the Commission authorised Sweden to pay aid towards the cost of transporting carcasses of fallen stock or emergency slaughtered animals from livestock farms situated in Northern Sweden beyond the 62nd Parallel to the Stenstorp installation. All livestock farms with fallen stock in Sweden pay a standard fee that in principle covers the transportation and destruction costs. However, in Northern Sweden the costs of transportation are considerably higher than in other regions of the country, and the standard fee is not sufficient to cover the extra costs. Therefore the aid referred to above was granted to cover the part of the transportation costs of carcasses exceeding the transportation costs from farms south of the 62nd Parallel. No aid was granted to destruction costs. Because the livestock farmers in Northern Sweden continued to pay the standard fee they never paid less for the disposal of fallen stock than the livestock farmers in other parts of the country. The Swedish authorities propose to prolong the validity of this scheme without any changes. Aid is available only to farmers and to no other operators. These farmers continue to pay the above-mentioned standard fee towards the transport and disposal costs of fallen stock. No aid is paid towards the destruction costs, which are covered by this fee.

Budget: SEK 2,4 million per annum (ca EUR 260870).
