Council Directive 74/290/EEC of 28 May 1974 adapting to technical progress Council Directive No 70/220/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by gases from positive-ignition engines of motor vehicles 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 28 May 1974 adapting to technical progress Council Directive No 70/220/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by gases from positive-ignition engines of motor vehicles (74/290/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community; 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission; 
Having regard to Council Directive No 70/156/EEC (1) of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, as amended by the Act of Accession (2) and in particular Articles 11, 12 and 13 thereof; 
Having regard to Council Directive No 70/220/EEC (3) of 20 March 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by gases from positive-ignition engines of motor vehicles as amended by the Act of Accession, and in particular Article 5 thereof; 
Whereas the protection of the public against increasing atmospheric pollution, particularly in towns, necessitates active measures for reducing the amount of gaseous pollutants emitted from positive-ignition engines designed to propel vehicles ; whereas such a reduction in the admissible level of emission is made possible by the progress which has been made in the construction of such engines; 
Whereas, in future, such engines must be fitted with carburettors which will permit the specified levels of emission to be complied with while the engines idle in all settings of the controls at the disposal of the user; 
Whereas the application of the present provisions of Directive No 70/220/EEC has shown that these provisions require amendment in order to facilitate performance of the present tests by the competent authorities; 
Whereas certain amendments are also required to simplify the administrative procedure for the type-approval of a motor vehicle as regards the emission of pollutants, in order in particular to allow the extension of type-approval to include vehicle types which, in weight and/or gear ratios, differ from the originally approved type; 
Whereas, on 10 October 1973, the Commission submitted a proposed amendment to the Committee on the Adaption to Technical Progress of the Directives on the Removal of Technical Barriers to Trade in the Motor Vehicle Sector for its Opinion; (1)OJ No L 42, 23.2.1970, p. 1. (2)OJ No L 73, 27.3.1972, p. 14. (3)OJ No L 76, 6.4.1970, p. 1. 
whereas that Opinion was not favourable and the Commission, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 (3) (b) of Directive No 70/156/EEC proposed to the Council measures to be adopted, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
Annexes I to V to Directive No 70/220/EEC are hereby amended in accordance with the Annex to the present Directive.

Approval may be extended to vehicle types of a reference weight requiring merely the use of the next higher or next lower equivalent inertia. 
4.1.2. If the reference weight of the vehicle type for which extension of the approval is requested requires the use of a flywheel of equivalent inertia higher than that used for the vehicle type already approved, extension of the approval shall be granted. 
4.1.3. If the reference weight of the vehicle type for which extension of the approval is requested requires the use of a flywheel of equivalent inertia lower than that used for the vehicle type already approved, extension of the approval shall be granted if the masses of the pollutants obtained from the vehicle already approved are within the limits prescribed for the vehicle for which extension of the approval is requested. 
4.2. Vehicle types with different overall gear rates 
Approval granted in respect of one vehicle type may, under the following conditions, be extended to vehicle types which differ from the approved type only in respect of their overall transmission ratios: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0006078%quot%%gt% 
shall be determined where V1 and V2 are, respectively, the speed at 1 000 rpm of the engine of the approved vehicle type and of the vehicle type for which extension of the approval is requested. %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0006079%quot%%gt% 
4.3. Vehicle types of different reference weights and different overall transmission ratios 
Approval granted in respect of one type of vehicle may be extended to vehicle types which differ from the approved type only in respect of their reference weights and their overall transmission ratios, where all the conditions laid down in items 4.1 and 4.2 above are fulfilled. 
4.4. Note

Conformity of the vehicle in a Type I test shall be checked as follows: 5.1.1.1. A vehicle shall be taken from the series and subjected to the test described in item 3.2.1.1. However, the limits shown in item 3.2.1.1.4 shall be replaced by the following: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0006080%quot%%gt% 
5.1.1.2. If the vehicle selected does not meet the requirements of item 5.1.1.1, the manufacturer may ask for measurements to be made on a sample of vehicles taken from the series, including the vehicle originally tested. The manufacturer shall determine the size n of the sample. Vehicles other than the vehicle originally selected shall be subjected to a single Type I test. %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0006081%quot%%gt% 
The production of the series shall then be deemed to conform if the following condition is met: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0006082%quot%%gt%

The following item 1.5 shall be added: 
%quot%1.5. Setting control for idling. 1.5.1. Definition 
For the purposes of this Directive, %quot%setting controls%quot% means those parts which can be used to alter the idling speed of the engine and can be easily adjusted by an operator using only the tools described under item 1.5.1.1 below. In particular, devices for calibrating fuel and air flow rates shall not be regarded as %quot%setting controls%quot% if their adjustment necessitates the removal of set-stops which normally prohibit their adjustment by anyone other than a qualified mechanic. 1.5.1.1. Tools which can be used to adjust the idle setting controls : screwdriver (ordinary or cross-headed), spanners (ring, open-ended or adjustable), pliers, Allen keys.

1.5.2.2. A sufficient number of characteristic positions shall be determined for each continuously variable setting control. 
1.5.2.3. The measurement of the carbon monoxide content of the exhaust gases must be taken at all possible positions of the setting controls, but with the continuously variable controls only for the positions stated under item 1.5.2.2. 
1.5.2.4. The Type II test shall be deemed satisfactory if either of the following conditions is fulfilled: 1.5.2.4.1. None of the values measured in accordance with the requirements of item 1.5.2.3 exceeds the limit value: 
1.5.2.4.2. the maximum content obtained if one of the setting controls is continuously varied while the setting of the other controls remains constant does not exceed the limit value, this condition having to be fulfilled in respect of the various combinations of the setting control configurations apart from the continuously varied control. 
1.5.2.5. The possible positions of the setting controls shall be limited, 1.5.2.5.1. by whichever of the following is greater : the lowest crankshaft speed which the engine can achieve at idling speed ; the crankshaft idling speed recommended by the manufacturer, minus 100 rpm; 
1.5.2.5.2. by whichever of the following is lowest : the highest crankshaft speed which the engine can be made to achieve via the idle setting controls ; the crankshaft idling speed recommended by the manufacturer plus 250 rpm ; the crankshaft speed at which the automatic clutch engages. 
1.5.2.6. In addition, setting positions which are incompatible with the proper functioning of the engine must not be taken as measuring points, in particular when an engine is fitted with several carburettors, all of the carburettors must be adjusted to the same setting.%quot% 
ANNEX V : TYPE III TEST 
The following item 5 shall be added after item 4.7.7.: 
%quot%5. ALTERNATIVE TEST METHODS 5.1. The vehicle shall be considered satisfactory if, under each of the measuring conditions specified in item 2.2, it is shown that the recirculating or venting system is able to recycle all of the crankcase gases which could be emitted to the atmosphere.
