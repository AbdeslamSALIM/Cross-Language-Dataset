Commission Directive 2002/1/EC 
of 7 January 2002 
amending Directive 94/39/EC as regards animal feedingstuffs for the support of liver function in case of chronic liver insufficiency 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 93/74/EEC of 13 September 1993 on feedingstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes(1), as last amended by Directive 1999/29/EC(2), and in particular Article 6(c) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) By Directive 94/39/EC(3), as amended by Directive 95/9/EC(4), the Commission has adopted a list of intended uses of animal feedingstuffs for particular nutritional purposes. 
(2) Further scientific research has demonstrated that there is no necessity to lower or moderate the level of fat in feedingstuffs intended to support liver function in chronic liver insufficiency for cats and dogs. It has however shown that it would be beneficial to indicate on the label the need for water to be available to animals fed with such feeds at all times. 
(3) Directive 94/39/EC should therefore be adapted accordingly. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Feedingstuffs,
