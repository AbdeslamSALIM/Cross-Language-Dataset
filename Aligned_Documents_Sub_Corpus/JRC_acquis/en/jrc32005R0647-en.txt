Regulation (EC) No 647/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 13 April 2005 
amending Council Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 42 and 308 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1], 
After consulting the Committee of the Regions, 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2], 
Whereas: 
(1) Certain amendments should be made to Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 [3] and (EEC) No 574/72 [4], in order to take account of recent developments in the of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, to facilitate the application of those Regulations and to reflect changes in the social security legislation of the Member States. 
(2) In order to take account of recent developments in, the conclusions of judgments should be drawn, particularly in the cases of Johann Franz Duchon 
v Pensionsversicherungsanstalt der Angestellten [5] and Office national de l'emploi v Calogero Spataro [6]. 
(3) The judgments in Friedrich Jauch v Pensionsversicherungsanstalt der Arbeiter and Ghislain Leclere, Alina Deaconescu v Caisse nationale des prestations familiales [7], concerning the classification of special non-contributory cash benefits require, for reasons of legal safety, that the two cumulative criteria to be taken into account be specified so that such benefits can feature in Annex IIa to Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71. On this basis, there is a case for revising the Annex, taking into account legislative amendments in the Member States affecting this type of benefits, which are subject to specific coordination given their mixed nature. In addition, it is important to specify the transitional provisions relating to the benefit which was the subject of the judgment in the Jauch case in order to protect the rights of beneficiaries. 
(4) On the basis of the case-law relating to the relationships between Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and the provisions of bilateral social security agreements, it is necessary to review Annex III to that Regulation. The entries in part A of Annex III are only justified in two cases: where they are more favourable to migrant workers [8], or where they relate to specific and exceptional situations, usually linked to historical circumstances. In addition, it is not appropriate to accept entries in part B except where exceptional and objective situations justify a derogation from Article 3(1) of that Regulation and from Articles 12, 39 and 42 of the Treaty [9]. 
(5) In order to facilitate the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, there should be certain provisions concerning, on the one hand, civil servants and persons treated as such and, on the other, members of the travelling or flying personnel of an undertaking which operates international transport services for passengers or goods by rail, road, air or inland waterway, and also to specify the methods for determining the average amount to take into account in the context of Article 23 of that Regulation. 
(6) The revision of Annex IIa to Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 will lead to the removal of some existing entries and, taking into account legislative amendments in some Member States, to the inclusion of certain new entries. In the latter case, it is then for these Member States to consider the need for transitional arrangements or bilateral solutions to address the situation of persons whose acquired rights may be affected as a consequence,
