Council Directive 86/298/EEC of 26 May 1986 on rear- mounted roll-over protection structures of narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVEof 26 May 1986on rear-mounted roll-over protection structures of narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors(86/298/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof,Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),Whereas Council Directive 74/150/EEC of 4 March 1974 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors (4), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, lays down that the necessary provisions for the implementation of the EEC type-approval procedure in respect of individual tractor parts or characteristics should be specified in special directives; whereas the provisions relating to roll-over protection structures and their attachments to tractors were laid down by Directives 77/536/EEC (5) and 79/622/EEC (6), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal; whereas these two Directives cover respectively dynamic and static testing procedures - either of which may be employed by manufacturers for the present - and relate to standard tractors, that is, tractors having a maximum ground clearance of 1 000 mm and a fixed or adjustable track width of one of the driving axles of not less than 1 150 mm and weighing between 1,5 and 4,5 tonnes in the case of tractors covered by the 'dynamic testing' Directive and not less than 800 kilograms in the case of tractors covered by the 'static testing' Directive;Whereas the tractors covered by this Directive have a maximum ground clearance of 600 mm, a minimum track width of both axles of less than 1 150 mm and a mass greater than 600 kilograms; whereas the roll-over protection structures of these tractors, which are used for specific activities, can be made subject to specific requirement or requirements other than those of Directive 77/536/EEC and 79/622/EEC; 
Whereas the technical requirements with which such 'narrow-track' tractors must comply pursuant to national laws relate inter alia to roll-over protection structures and to their attachment to the tractor; whereas those requirements differ from one Member State to another; whereas it is therefore necessary that all Member States adopt the same requirements either in addition to or in place of their existing rules in order, in particular, to allow the EEC type-approval procedure which was the subject of Directive 74/150/EEC to be introduced in respect of each type of tractor;Whereas this Directive covers roll-over protection structures of the rear-mounted rollbar, frame or cab type having a zone of clearance whose upper limit is 900 mm above the seat reference point in order to provide a sufficiently large area or unobstructed space for the protection of the driver; whereas another special Directive will be adopted in respect of roll-over protection structures having two pillars mounted in front of the driver;Whereas a harmonized component type-approval procedure for roll-over protection structures and their attachment to the tractor makes it possible for each Member State to check compliance with the common construction and testing requirements and to inform the other Member States of its findings by sending them copies of the component type-approval certificate completed for each type of roll-over protection structure and its attachment to the tractor; whereas the placing of an EEC component type-approval mark on all structures manufactured in conformity with the approved type obviates any need for technical checks on those structures in the other Member States; whereas common requirements concerning other elements and characteristics of the roll-over protection structure, in particular, devices to prevent continuous roll-over if the tractor overturns, and protection of occupants, will be laid down at a later date;Whereas the harmonized requirements are intended principally to ensure safety on the road and at work throughout the Community; whereas, for this reason, it is necessary to introduce the obligation for tractors covered by this Directive to be fitted with roll-over protection structures;Whereas the approximation of the national laws relating to these tractors entails reciprocal recognition by Member States of the checks carried out by each of them on the basis of the common requirements, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
This Directive shall apply to tractors as defined in Article 1 
of Directive 74/150/EEC having the following characteristics:ground clearance of not more than 600 mm measured beneath the lowest points of the front or rear axles, allowing for the differential,fixed or adjustable minimum track width of one of the two axles less than 1 150 mm; under no circumstances must the outer edge of the tyres on the other axle 
go beyond the outer edge of the tyres on the axle of 
1 150 mm minimum track width,mass greater than 600 kilograms and corresponding to the unladen weight of the tractor as defined in section 2.4 of Annex I to Directive 74/150/EEC, including the roll-over protection structure fitted in compliance with this Directive and tyres of the largest size recommended by the manufacturer. 
Article 2 
1. Each Member State shall grant EEC component type-approval for any type of roll-over protection structure and its tractor attachment which satisfies the construction and testing requirements laid down in Annexes I to IV.2. A Member State which has granted EEC component type-approval shall take the measures required to verify, in so far as is necessary and if need be in cooperation with the competent authorities in the other Member States, that production models conform to the approved type. Such verification shall be limited to spot checks. 
Article 3 
Member States shall, for each type of roll-over protection structure and its tractor attachment which they approve pursuant to Article 2, issue to the manufacturer of the tractor or of the roll-over protection structure, or to his authorized representative, an EEC component type-approval mark conforming to the model shown in Annex VI.Member States shall take all appropriate measures to prevent the use of marks liable to create confusion between roll-over protection structures which have been component type-approved pursuant to Article 2 and other devices. 
Article 4 
1. N° Member State may prohibit the placing on the market of roll-over protection structures or their attachment 
to the tractors for which they are intended on grounds relating to their construction if they bear the EEC component type-approval mark.2. Nevertheless, a Member State may prohibit the placing on the market of roll-over protection structures bearing the EEC component type-approval mark which consistently fail to conform to the approved type.That State shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission of the measures taken, specifying the reasons for its decision. 
Article 5 
The competent authorities of each Member State shall, within one month, send to the competent authorities of the Member State a copy of the component type-approval certificates, an example of which is given in Annex VII, completed for each type of roll-over protection structure which they approve or refuse to approve. 
Article 6 
1. If the Member State which has granted EEC component type-approval finds that a number of roll-over protection structures and their tractor attachments bearing the same EEC component type-approval mark do not conform to the type which it has approved, it shall take the necessary measures to ensure that production models conform to the approved type. The competent authorities of that State shall advise those of the other Member States of the measures taken which may, if necessary, where there is serious and repeated failure to conform, extend to withdrawal of EEC component type-approval. The said authorities shall take the same measures if they are informed by the competent authorities of another Member State of such failure to conform.2. The competent authorities of the Member States shall within one month inform each other of any withdrawal of EEC component type-approval and of the reasons for any such measure. 
Article 7 
Any decision taken pursuant to the provisions adopted in implementation of this Directive to refuse or withdraw component type-approval for roll-over protection structures and their tractor attachments, or to prohibit their placing on the market or their use, shall set out in detail the reasons on which it is based. Such decisions shall be notified to the party concerned, who shall at the same time be informed of the remedies available to him under the laws in force in the Member States and of the time limits allowed for the exercise of such remedies. 
Article 8 
N° Member State may refuse to grant EEC type-approval or national type-approval in respect of a tractor on grounds 
relating to roll-over protection structures or their tractor attachment if these bear the EEC component type-approval mark and if the requirements laid down in Annex VIII have been satisfied. 
Article 9 
N° Member State may refuse or prohibit the sale, registration, entry into service or use of any tractor on grounds relating to the roll-over protection structure and its tractor attachment if these bear the EEC component type-approval mark and if the requirements laid down in Annex VIII have been met. 
Article 10 
This Directive shall not affect the right of Member States to specify - in due compliance with the Treaty - the requirements they deem necessary to ensure that workers are protected when using the tractors in question, provided this does not mean that the protection structures are modified in a way unspecified in this Directive. 
Article 11 
1. In connection with EEC type-approval, any tractor to which Article 1 refers must be fitted with a roll-over protection structure.2. Where the protection structure is not one having two pillars mounted in front of the driver's seat, the structure referred to in paragraph 1 must comply with the requirements laid down in Annexes I to IV to this Directive or to Directives 77/536/EEC or 79/622/EEC. 
Article 12 
Any amendments necessary in order to adapt the requirements of the Annexes to this Directive so as to take account of technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Directive 74/150/EEC. 
Article 13 
Within 18 months of the notification of this Directive, the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, on the basis of the provisions of the Treaty, shall adopt a Directive supplementing this Directive by means of provisions introducing the additional impact tests in the dynamic test procedure.

ANNEX III 
TEST PROCEDURE 
A. Dynamic tests 
1.IMPACT AND CRUSHING TESTS1.1.Impact at the rear1.1.1.The tractor shall be so placed in relation to the pendulum block that the block will strike the protection structure when the impact face of the block and the supporting chains or wire ropes are at an angle with the vertical plane equal to mt/100 with a 20g maximum, unless, during deflection, the protection structure at the point of contact forms a greater angle to the vertical. In this case the impact face of the block shall be adjusted by means of an additional support so that it is parallel to the protection structure at the point of impact at the moment of maximum deflection, the supporting chains or wire ropes remaining at the angle defined above.The suspended height of the block shall be adjusted, and necessary steps taken so as to prevent the block from turning about the point of contact.The point of impact shall be that part of the protection structure likely to hit the ground first in a rearward overturning accident, normally the upper edge. The position of the centre of gravity of the block shall be one-sixth of the width of the top of the protection structure inwards from a vertical plane parallel to the median plane of the tractor touching the outside extremity of the top of the protection structure.If the structure is curved or protruding at this point, wedges enabling the impact to be applied thereon will have to be added, without thereby reinforcing the structure.1.1.2.The tractor shall be lashed to the ground by means of four wire ropes, one at each end of both axles, arranged as indicated in Figure 5 of Annex IV. The front and rear lashing points shall be located at a distance such that the wire ropes make an angle of less than 30g with the ground. The rear lashings shall in addition be so arranged that the point of convergence of the two wire ropes is located in the vertical plane in which the centre of gravity of the block travels.The wire ropes must be tensioned such that the tyres undergo the deflections given in Item 6.2 of 
Annex II A.With the wire ropes tensioned, the wedging beam shall be placed in front of and tight against the rear wheels and then fixed to the ground.1.1.3.If the tractor is of the articulated type, the point of articulation shall, in addition, be supported by a wooden block at least 100 mm square and firmly lashed to the ground.1.1.4.The pendulum block shall be pulled back so that the height of its centre of gravity above that at the point of impact is given by one of the following two formulae:H = 2,165×10-8 mt L$ or H = 5,73×10-2 I. 
The block must then be released so as to strike the protection structure.1.2.Impact at the front1.2.1.The tractor shall be so placed in relation to the pendulum block that the block will strike the protection structure when the impact face of the block and the supporting chains or wire ropes are at an angle with the vertical plane, equal to mt/100 with a 20g maximum, unless, during deflection, the protection structure at the point of contact forms a greater angle to the vertical. In this case the impact face of the block shall be adjusted by means of an additional support so that it is parallel to the protection structure at the point of impact at the moment of maximum deflection, the supporting chains or wire ropes remaining at the angle defined above.The suspended height of the pendulum block shall be adjusted and necessary steps taken so as to prevent the block from turning about the point of contact.The point of impact shall be that part of the protection structure likely to hit the ground first if the tractor overturns sideways while travelling forward, normally the upper edge. The position of the 
centre of gravity of the block shall be one-sixth of the width of the top of the protection structure inwards from a vertical plane parallel to the median plane of the tractor touching the outside extremity of the top of the protection structure.If the structure is curved or protruding at this point, wedges enabling the impact to be applied thereon will have to be added, without thereby reinforcing the structure.1.2.2.The tractor shall be lashed to the ground by means of four wire ropes, one at each end of both axles, arranged as indicated in Figure 6 of Annex IV. The front and rear lashing points shall be located at a distance such that the wire ropes make an angle of less than 30g with the ground. The rear lashings shall, in addition, be so arranged that the point of convergence of the two wire ropes is located in the vertical plane in which the centre of gravity of the pendulum block travels.The wire ropes must be tensioned such that the tyres undergo the deflections given in Item 6.2 of 
Annex II A.With the wire ropes tensioned, the wedging beam shall be placed firmly behind the rear wheels and then fixed to the ground.1.2.3.If the tractor is of the articulated type, the point of articulation shall in addition be supported by a wooden block at least 100 mm square and firmly lashed to the ground.1.2.4.The pendulum block shall be pulled back so that the height of its centre of gravity above that at the point of impact is given by one of the following two formulae, to be chosen according to the reference mass of the tractors subjected to the tests:H = 25 + 0,07 mt for tractors with a reference mass of less than 2 000 kilograms,H = 125 + 0,02 mt for tractors with a reference mass of more than 2 000 kilograms.The pendulum block must then be released so as to strike the protection structure.1.3.Impact from the side1.3.1.The tractor shall be so placed in relation to the pendulum block that the block will strike the protection structure when the impact face of the weight and the supporting chains or wire ropes are vertical unless, during deflection, the protection structure at the point of contact forms an angle to the vertical. In this case the impact face of the block shall be adjusted by means of an additional support so that it is parallel to the protection structure at the point of impact at the moment of maximum deflection, the supporting chains or wire ropes remaining vertical on impact.The suspended height of the block shall be adjusted and necessary steps taken so as to prevent the block from turning about the point of contact.The point of impact shall be that part of the protection structure likely to hit the ground first in a sideways overturning accident, normally the upper edge. Unless it is certain that another part of this edge would hit the ground first, the point of impact shall be in the plane at right angles to the median plane and passing 200 mm in front of the seat reference point, the seat being set at the mid position of the longitudinal seat adjustment.1.3.2.The tractor wheels on the side which is to receive the impact shall be lashed to the ground by means of wire ropes passing over the corresponding ends of the front and rear axles. The wire ropes shall be tensioned to produce the tyre deflection values given in Item 6.2 of Annex II A on the side which is to receive the impact.With the wire ropes tensioned, the wedging beam shall be placed on the ground, pushed tight against the tyres on the side opposite that which is to receive the impact and then fixed to the ground. It may be necessary to use two beams or wedges if the outer sides of the front and rear tyres are not in the same vertical plane.The prop shall then be placed as indicated in Figure 7 of Annex IV against the rim of the wheel opposite to the impact, pushed firmly against the rim and then fixed at its base.The length of the rop shall be chosen such that it makes an angle of 30 p 3g with the ground when in position against the rim. In addition, its length must, if possible, be between 20 and 25 times greater than its thickness and its width between two and three times greater than its thickness. The props shall be shaped at both ends as shown in the details of Figure 7 of Annex IV.1.3.3.If the tractor is of the articulated type, the point of articulation shall, in addition, be supported by a wooden block at least 100 mm square and laterally supported by a device similar to that provided for in Item 1.3.2 against the rear wheel. The point of articulation shall then be lashed firmly to the ground. 
1.3.4.The pendulum block shall be pulled back so that the height of its centre of gravity above that at the point of impact is given by one of the following two formulae, to be chosen according to the reference mass of the tractors subjected to the tests:H = 25 + 0,20 mt for tractors with a reference mass of less than 2 000 kilograms,H = 125 + 0,15 mt for tractors with a reference mass of more than 2 000 kilograms.The pendulum block must then be released so as to strike the protection structure.1.4.Crushing at the rearThe beam shall be positioned over the rear uppermost structural member(s) and the resultant of the crushing forces shall be located in the tractor's median plane.A force, Fv = 20 mt shall be applied.Where the rear part of the protection structure roof will not sustain the full crushing force, the force shall be applied until the roof is deflected to coincide with the plane joining the upper part of the protection structure with that part of the rear of the tractor capable of supporting the vehicle's mass when overturned.The force shall then be removed, and the tractor or loading force repositioned so that the beam is over that point of the protection structure which would then support the tractor when completely overturned.The force Fv shall then be applied.It shall be applied for a minimum of five seconds following the cessation of any visually detectable deflection.1.5.Crushing at the frontThe beam shall be positioned over the front uppermost structural member(s) and the resultant of the crushing forces shall be located in the tractor's median plane.A force, Fv = 20 mt shall be applied.Where the front part of the protection structure roof will not sustain the full crushing force, the force shall be applied until the roof is deflected to coincide with the plane joining the upper part of the protection structure with that part of the front of the tractor capable of supporting the vehicle's mass when overturned.The force shall then be removed, and the tractor or loading force repositioned so that the beam is over that point of the protection structure which would then support the tractor when completely overturned.The force Fv shall then be applied.It shall be applied for a minimum of five seconds following the cessation of any visually detectable deflection.1.6.Additional testsIf cracks or tears which cannot be considered negligible appear during a crushing test, a second similar crushing test, but with a force equal to 1,2 Fv, shall be applied immediately after the crushing test which caused the cracks or tears to appear.2.ZONE OF CLEARANCE2.1.The zone of clearance is shown in Figures 1, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d and 2e of Annex IV.The zone is defined on the basis of a 'vertical reference plane', generally longitudinal to the tractor and passing through the seat reference point and the centre of the steering wheel. This plane must be able to move horizontally with the seat and the steering wheel during the impact but to remain perpendicular to the floor of the tractor or of the protection structure if this is resiliently mounted.2.2.The zone is bounded by the following planes, the tractor being on a horizontal surface and, where the steering wheel is adjustable, its position adjusted for normal seated driving.2.2.1.A horizontal plane - A1B1B2A2 - 900 mm above the seat reference point. 
2.2.2.An inclined plane - H1H2G2G1 - perpendicular to the vertical reference plane and including a point 900 mm directly above the seat reference point and the rearmost point of the seat backrest.2.2.3.A cylindrical surface - A1A2H2H1 - which is perpendicular to the reference plane, has a radius of 
120 mm and is tangential to the planes defined above in Items 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.2.2.4.A cylindrical surface - B1C1C2B2 - perpendicular to the reference plane, having a radius of 900 mm and extending forward by 400 mm the plane defined in Item 2.2.1 above, to which it is tangential, following a horizontal line 150 mm forward of the seat reference point.2.2.5.A inclined plane - C1D1D2C2 - perpendicular to the reference plane, extending the surface defined in Item 2.2.4 above and passing through a point 40 mm from the outer edge of the steering wheel.2.2.6.A vertical plan - D1K1E1E2K2D2 - perpendicular to the reference plane and passing 40 mm in front of the other edge of the steering wheel.2.2.7.A horizontal plane - E1F1P1N1N2P2F2E2 - passing through the seat reference point.2.2.8.A curvilinear surface - G1L1M1N1N1M2L2G2 - perpendicular to the reference plaen and in contact with the back of the seat backrest.2.2.9.Two vertical planes - K1I1F1E1 and K2I2F2E2 - parallel to the reference plane, 250 mm either side of this plane, and bounded towards the top 300 mm above the horizontal plane passing through the seat reference point.2.2.10.Two inclined and parallel planes - A1B1C1D1K1I1L1G1H1 and A2B2C2D2K2I2L2G2H2 - starting from the upper edge of the planes defined in Item 2.2.9 above and joining the horizontal plane defined in Item 2.2.1 above at least 100 mm from the reference plane on the side where the impact is applied.2.2.11.Two vertical planes - Q1P1N1M1 and Q2P2N2M2 - parallel to the reference plane, 200 mm either side of this plane, and bounded towards the top 300 mm above the horizontal plane passing through the seat reference point.2.2.12.Two portions - I1Q1P1F1 and I2Q2P2F2 - of a vertical plane, perpendicular to the reference plane and passing 350 mm in front of the seat reference point.2.2.13.Two portions - I1Q1M1L1 - and I2Q2M2L2 - of the horizontal plane passing 300 mm above the seat reference point.2.3.Seat location and seat reference point2.3.1Seat reference point2.3.1.1.The refernce point shall be established using the apparatus illustrated in Figures 3 and 3b of Annex IV. The apparatus shall consist of a seat pan board and backrest boards. The lower backrest board shall be jointed in the region of the ischium humps (A) and loin (B), the joint (B) being adjustable in height.2.3.1.2.The reference point is defined as the point in the median longitudinal plane of the seat where the tangential plane of the lower backrest and a horizontal plane intersect. This horizontal plane cuts the lower surface of the seat pan board 150 mm in front of the abovementioned tangent.2.3.1.3.The apparatus shall be positioned on the seat. It shall then be loaded with a force of 550 N at a point 
50 mm in front of joint (A), and the two parts of the backrest board shall be lightly pressed tangentially against the backrest.2.3.1.4.If it is not possible to determine definite tangents to each area of the backrest (above and below the lumbar region) the following must be done:2.3.1.4.1.Where no definite tangent to the lower area is possible the lower part of the backrest board is pressed against the backrest vertically.2.3.1.4.2.Where no definite tangent to the upper area is possible the joint (B) is fixed at a height of 230 mm above the lower surface of the seat pan board, the backrest board being perpendicular to the latter. Then the two parts of the backrest board are lightly pressed against the backrest.2.3.2.Seat position and adjustment for determining the location of the seat reference point2.3.2.1.Where the seat position is adjustable, the seat must be adjusted to its rear uppermost position.2.3.2.2.Where the inclination of the backrest and seat pan is adjustable, these must be adjusted so that the reference point is in its rear uppermost position.2.3.2.3.Where the seat is equipped with suspension, the latter must be blocked at mid-travel, unless this is contrary to the instructions clearly laid down by the seat manufacturer. 
3.MEASUREMENTS TO BE MADE3.1.Fractures and cracksAfter each test all structural members, joints and fastening systems shall be visually examined for fractures or cracks, any small cracks in unimportant parts being ignored.Any tears caused by the edges of the pendulum weight shall be ignored.3.2.Zone of clearance3.2.1.During each test an examination shall be made to see whether any part of the protection structure has entered the zone of clearance round the driver's seat as defined in Item 2 of this Annex.3.2.2.In addition, an examination shall be made to determine whether any part of the zone of clearance is outside the protection of the protection structure. For this purpose it shall be considered to be outside the protection of the roll-over protection structure if any part of it would have come into contact with flat ground if the tractor had overturned towards the direction from which the impact came. For this purpose the front and rear tyre and track setting shall be assumed to be the smallest specified by the manufacturer.3.3.Elastic deflection (on side impact)The elastic deflection shall be measured 900 mm above the seat reference point, in the vertical plane passing through the point of impact. For this measurement, apparatus as shown in Figure 9 of 
Annex IV shall be used.3.4.Permanent deflectionAfter the final crushing test, the permanent deflection of the protection structure shall be recorded. For this purpose, before the start of the test, the position of the main protection structure members in relation to the seat reference point shall be recorded. 
B. Static tests 
1.LOADING AND CRUSHING TESTS1.1.Loading at the rear1.1.1.The load shall be applied horizontally, in a vertical plane parallel to the tractor's median plane.The load application point shall be that part of the protection structure likely to hit the ground first in a rearward overturning accident, normally the upper edge. The vertical plane in which the load is applied shall be located at a distance of one-third of the external width of the upper part of the structure from the median plane.If the structure is curved or protruding at this point, wedges enabling the load to be applied thereon will have to be added, without thereby reinforcing the structure.1.1.2.The assembly defined in Item 1.3.1 of Annex II shall be lashed to the ground as described in Item 3 of Annex II B.1.1.3.The energy absorbed by the protection structure during the test shall be at leastEil = 2,165×10-7 mt L$ or Eil = 0,574×I. 
1.2.Loading at the front1.2.1.The load shall be applied horizontally in a vertical plane parallel to the tractor's median plane.The point of application shall be that part of the protection structure likely to hit the ground first if the tractor overturns sideways while travelling forward, i.e. normally the upper egde. The point of application of the load shall be one-sixth of the width of the top of the protection structure inwards from a vertical plane parallel to the median plane of the tractor touching the outside extremity of the top of the protection structure.If the structure is curved or protruding at this point, wedges enabling the load to be applied thereon will have to be added, without thereby reinforcing the structure.1.2.2.The assembly defined in Item 1.3.1 of Annex II shall be anchored to the ground as described in Item 3 of Annex II B.1.2.3.The energy absorbed by the protection structure during the test shall be at leastEil = 500 + 0,5 mt 
1.3.Loading from the side1.3.1.The side loading shall be applied horizontally, in a vertical plane perpendicular to the tractor's median plane and passing 200 mm in front of the seat reference point, the seat being at the mid position of the longitudinal seat adjustment.The load application point shall be that part of the protection structure likely to hit the ground first in a sideways overturning accident, normally the upper edge.1.3.2.The assembly defined in Item 1.3.1 of Annex II shall be lashed to the ground as described in Item 3 of Annex II B.1.3.3.The energy absorbed by the protection structure during the test shall be at leastEis = 1,75 mt 
1.4.Crushing at the rearAll provisions are identical to those given in Item 1.4 of Annex III A.1.5.Crushing at the frontAll provisions are identical to those given in Item 1.5 of Annex III A.1.6.Overload test1.6.1.An overload test shall be carried out where the force decreases by more than 3 % during the last 5 % 
of the deflection reached when the energy required is absorbed by the structure (see Figure 10b of 
Annex IV). 
1.6.2.The overload test involves the gradual increase of the horizontal load by increments of 5 % of the initial energy requirement up to a maximum of 20 % of energy added (see Figure 10c of Annex IV).1.6.2.1.The overload test is satisfactory if, after each increase by 5 %, 10 % or 15 % in the energy required, the force decreases by less than 3 % for a 5 % increment and remains more than 0,8 Fmax.1.6.2.2.The overload test is satisfactory if, after the structure has absorbed 20 % of the added energy, the force exceeds 0,8 Fmax.1.6.2.3.Additional cracks or tears and/or entry into or lack of protection of the zone of clearance due to elastic deflection are permitted during the overload test. However, after the removal of the load, the structure shall not enter the zone of clearance, which shall be completely protected.1.7.Crushing testIf cracks or tears which cannot be considered as negligible appear during a crushing test, a second, similar crushing, but with a force of 1,2 Fv, shall be applied immediately after the crushing which caused the cracks or tears to appear.2.ZONE OF CLEARANCEThe zone of clearance is identical to that described in Item 2 of Annex III A above, except that the word 'impact' is to be replaced by 'load' in the last line of Item 2.2.10.3.MEASUREMENTS TO BE MADE3.1.Fractures and cracksAfter each test all structural members, joints and attachment systems shall be visually examined for fractures or cracks, any small cracks in unimportant parts being ignored.3.2.Zone of clearance3.2.1.During each test an examination shall be made to see whether any part of the protection structure has entered the zone of clearance as defined in Item 2 above.3.2.2.In addition, an examination shall be made to determine whether any part of the zone of clearance is outside the protection of the protection structure. For this purpose it shall be considered to be outside the protection of the protection structure if any part of it would have come into contact with flat ground if the tractor had overturned towards the direction from which the impact came. For this purpose the front and rear tyres and track setting shall be assumed to be the smallest specified by the manufacturer.3.3.Elastic deflection (under side loading)The elastic deflection shall be measured 900 mm above the reference point, in the vertical plane in which the load is applied. For this measurement, any apparatus similar to that illustrated in Figure 9 of Annex IV, may be used.3.4.Permanent deflectionAfter the tests, the permanent deflection of the protection structure shall be recorded. For this purpose, before the start of the tests, the position of the main protection structure members in relation to the seat reference point shall be recorded.
