COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 355/95 of 20 February 1995 amending Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113, thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas by Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 (1) the Council has adopted common rules for protection against dumped imports from countries which are not members of the European Community; 
Whereas Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 repealed Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 (2) on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries which are not members of the European Economic Community; 
Whereas by Article 24 thereof, Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 applied to proceedings and interim review investigations initiated after 1 September 1994 and to expiry review investigations for which the notice of impending expiry of measures was published after that date; 
Whereas it is, therefore, necessary to amend Articles 23 and 24 of Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 in order to state clearly that Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 continues to apply to proceedings pending on 1 September 1994,
