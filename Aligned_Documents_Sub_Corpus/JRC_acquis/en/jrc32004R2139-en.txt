THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 of 29 February 1988 on the organisation of Community surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings [1], and in particular Article 8(1) and (4) thereof and point 5 of Annex II thereto, 
Whereas: 
(1) The accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic on 1 May 2004 makes it necessary to amend the list of characteristics set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 571/88. 
(2) The new political goal of achieving a sustainable common agricultural policy calls for more information, especially on rural development. 
(3) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) [2], all Member States’ statistics transmitted to the Commission which are broken down by territorial units should use the NUTS classification. Consequently, for the purposes of surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings (hereinafter referred to as the farm structure surveys), the regions and districts should be defined in accordance with the NUTS classification. 
(4) Time limits for the communication of validated individual data from the farm structure surveys should be established by the Commission, taking into account the fact that the timetable for carrying out the survey work differs between Member States. 
(5) Both Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 itself and the decision laying down the definitions and explanations relating to that Regulation, namely Commission Decision 2000/115/EC [3], should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics established by Council Decision 72/279/EEC [4],

AMENDMENTS TO ANNEX I TO DECISION 2000/115/EC 
1. Amendments to paragraph A: 
subparagraph A/1 II: 
"The regions and districts for the purposes of the agricultural structure surveys are listed in Annex IV."; 
and the following sentence in paragraph A/1 (a) II: 
"If these codes cannot be transmitted, the Member State communicates instead, for each holding, the information indicated in characteristics A/2, A/2(a) and A/3."; 
are deleted. 
2. Amendments to paragraph C: 
the following subparagraph is added to paragraph C: 
"C/05. Farming system and practices 
1. C/5 (f) Aid for investments during the last five years 
I. Public aid for investment concerns measures covered by Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 concerning rural development. 
II. "Directly" means that the characteristic does not cover investment aid which is not paid directly to the holding but provided at a higher level (regional or group), even if the holding would have benefited from this aid indirectly. Examples of investments not covered are: 
- basic services for the rural economy and population, 
- development and improvement of infrastructure connected with the development of agriculture, 
- setting-up of farm relief and farm management services, 
- marketing of quality agricultural products, 
- land improvement, 
- reparcelling. 
Nor does the question cover support and measures existing in Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 that are not related to investments such as: 
- training (chapter III), 
- early retirement (chapter IV), 
- LFA and areas with environmental restrictions (chapter V), 
- agro-environment (chapter VI). 
2. C/5 (f) (i) Benefit from public aid within the framework of productive investments 
I. Productive investments concern, in Regulation 1257/1999: 
- Article 4 : investment in agricultural holdings; 
- Article 8: setting-up of young farmers. 
3. C/5 (f) (ii) Benefit from public aid within the framework of rural development measures 
I. The rural development measures covered by this question are certain measures implemented under Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999: 
- renovation and development of villages and protection and conservation of the rural heritage, 
- diversification of agricultural activities and activities close to agriculture to provide multiple activities or alternative incomes, 
- encouragement for tourist and craft activities, 
- protection of the environment in connection with agriculture, forestry and landscape conservation as well as with the improvement of animal welfare, 
- financial engineering, 
as well as investment in forestry (chapter VIII). 
C/06 Destination of the holding’s production 
4. C/6 (a) The holder’s household consumption 
II. Gifts to family and relatives without remuneration should be considered as household consumption. Final production follows the definition used in agricultural accounts (i.e. production used as inputs for other production, such as forage for animal production, should not be taken into account in the total of production). 
The 50 % should of course not be considered as an exact threshold, but just as an order of magnitude. 
5. C/6(b) Direct sales to consumers 
II. The 50 % should of course not be considered as the result of an exact estimation, but as an order of magnitude."
