Notification by the Czech Republic concerning visa reciprocity 
Notification by the Czech Republic concerning visa reciprocity [1] 
(2005/C 251/16) 
The Permanent Representation of the Czech Republic to the EU presents its compliments to the Council of the European Union and has the honour to express its appreciation for the Council of the European Union once again for its continued cooperation and support on various matters related to the everyday conduct of duties of the Permanent Representation. In view of the amicable and working atmosphere existing between the Council of the European Union and the Permanent Representation, the latter wishes to use this opportunity to bring to the attention of the Council of the European Union the following issue. 
The Czech Republic officially notifies the countries which despite of the fact the Czech Republic being a Member State of the EU since 1 May 2004 still apply the unilateral visa regime to the Czech citizens. 
By this note on the basis of Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 851/2005 of 2 June 2005 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visa when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement, the Czech Republic notifies the United States of America as the country which unilaterally applies the visa regime to the nationals of the Czech Republic. 
As the visa reciprocity issue is considered to be a very sensitive problem on political level the Czech Republic believes that the appropriate measures will be taken to assure that all EU citizens on one side and the citizens of the United States of America on the other side will enjoy the same equal and reciprocal regime when crossing the respective borders. 
The Permanent Representation of the Czech Republic to the European Union avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Council of the European Union the assurances of its highest consideration and friendship.
