Commission Regulation (EC) No 2033/2004 
of 26 November 2004 
opening a tendering procedure for the refund on consignment of husked long-grain B rice to Réunion 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice [1], and in particular Article 5(3) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Examination of the supply balance in Réunion indicates that rice is in short supply. In view of the rice available on the Community market, Réunion should be able to be supplied with rice from the Community market by granting a subsidy for consignments of rice intended for consumption there. Because of Réunion's particular circumstances, it is appropriate to limit the quantities to be sent and thus fix the amount of the subsidy by tendering procedure. 
(2) It should be stated that Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2692/89 of 6 September 1989 laying down detailed rules for exports of rice to Réunion [2] applies to this tendering procedure. 
(3) Under Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture [3], amounts quoted in tenders submitted in response to invitations to tender organised under an instrument forming part of the common agricultural policy must be expressed in euro.
