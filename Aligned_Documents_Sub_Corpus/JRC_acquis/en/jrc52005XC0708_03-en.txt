See the HS Explanatory Notes to heading 6112, (C), mentioning that heading 6112 includes inter alia swimming shorts and trunks, whether or not elastic. 
Swimming shorts are garments which, because of their general appearance, cut and nature of fabric, are intended to be worn solely or mainly as swimwear and not as "shorts" of heading 6103 or 6104. In general they are entirely or mainly made of man-made fibres. 
Swimming shorts must have all the following characteristics: 
have inner briefs sewn to the garment or at least 
- a lining in the front or the crotch 
- be tight at the waist (e.g. have a drawstring or a fully elasticated waist) 
Swimming shorts may have pockets provided that 
- the outside pockets have a firm fastening system (e.g. they have to have a zip fastening or velcro type fastening to close the pocket completely, i.e. they may not be fastened at intervals) 
- the inside pockets have the same firm fastening system as the outside pockets mentioned above. However, inside pockets when fixed to the waist may merely have an overlap closing system provided that it assures complete closure of the pocket opening. 
Swimming shorts cannot have any of the following characteristics: 
- a front opening even if closed by a closing system 
- an opening at the waist even if closed by a closing system."
