(notified under document number C(2006) 3585) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2006/563/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market [1], and in particular Article 9(4) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market [2], and in particular Article 10(4) thereof, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC [3], and in particular Article 18 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming. There is a risk that the disease agent might be spread from wild birds to domestic birds, notably poultry, and from one Member State to other Member States and third countries through international trade in live birds or their products. 
(2) Cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of the subtype virus H5N1, hereinafter "HPAI H5N1", have been suspected or confirmed in several Member States. Taking into account the epidemiological situation, Commission Decision 2006/115/EC of 17 February 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds in the Community and repealing Decisions 2006/86/EC, 2006/90/EC, 2006/91/EC, 2006/94/EC, 2006/104/EC and 2006/105/EC [4] was adopted. 
(3) The measures laid down in Council Directive 92/40/EEC of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza [5] were reviewed in-depth in the light of recent scientific knowledge on the risk of avian influenza for animal and public health, the development of new laboratory tests and vaccines and the experience gained during recent outbreaks of that disease in the Community as well as in third countries. Taking account of that review, Directive 92/40/EEC was repealed and replaced by Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC [6], which is to be transposed by Member States by 1 July 2007. 
(4) Pending the transposition of Directive 2005/94/EC and given the current disease situation in relation to avian influenza in the Community, it was necessary to lay down transitional measures to be applied on holdings where outbreaks of avian influenza caused by HPAI viruses are suspected or confirmed in poultry or other captive birds. 
(5) Those transitional measures, which are laid down in Commission Decision 2006/416/EC of 14 June 2006 concerning certain transitional measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry or other captive birds in the Community [7], should enable the Member States to adopt disease control measures in a proportionate and flexible manner, taking into account the various levels of risk posed by the different virus strains, the likely social and economic impact of the measures in question on the agriculture sector and other sectors involved, while at the same time ensuring that the measures taken for each specific scenario are the most appropriate. 
(6) With progress made in transposition of Directive 2005/94/EC by certain Member States, any reference to the transitional measures should be construed as a reference to the corresponding paragraph in Directive 2005/94/EC. 
(7) In order to complement the measures pursuant to Directive 92/40/EEC Commission Decision 2006/135/EC of 22 February 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry in the Community [8] was adopted. 
(8) Decision 2006/135/EC has now been replaced by Commission Decision 2006/415/EC of 14 June 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in poultry in the Community and repealing Decision 2006/135/EC [9] in order to harmonise the interaction between the transitional measures to be taken in case of a HPAI outbreak in poultry and the additional restrictions in case of a HPAI H5N1 suspected or confirmed outbreak in poultry or other captive birds. 
(9) Experience with the implementation of Decision 2006/115/EC in affected Member States has shown that certain adjustments for the establishment of the restricted zones and for certain restrictions of movements of live poultry or products derived from them should be permitted on the basis of a risk assessment performed by the competent authority taking into account the level of risk influenced by geographical, limnological, ecological and epizootiological factors. 
(10) In the interests of consistency of Community legislation, it is appropriate to apply for the purposes of this Decision certain definitions provided for in Directive 2005/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin [10] and Regulation (EC) No 998/2003. 
(11) A control and a monitoring area should be established around the place where HPAI of H5 subtype was detected in wild birds. Those areas should be limited to what is necessary to prevent virus introduction into commercial and non-commercial poultry flocks. 
(12) In the interests of consistency of Community legislation, the biosecurity measures provided for in Commission Decision 2005/734/EC of 19 October 2005 laying down biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by influenza virus A subtype H5N1 from birds living in the wild to poultry and other captive birds and providing for an early detection system in areas at particular risk [11] should be taken into account in control and monitoring areas, independently of the defined risk status of the area where highly pathogenic avian influenza is suspected or confirmed in wild birds. 
(13) It is appropriate to restrict the movement of, in particular, live poultry and other captive birds, day-old chicks, hatching eggs and products of avian origin from the established control and monitoring areas. However, the dispatch under official control from these areas may only be authorised under certain conditions to avoid the possible spread of the disease. 
(14) Specific derogations should also be provided for hatching eggs or SPF-eggs used in specialised laboratories or institutes for scientific, diagnostic or pharmaceutical purposes, as they pose a negligible risk for the spread of infection. 
(15) The transport of hatching eggs from the control area should be permitted under certain conditions. The dispatch of hatching eggs to other Member States may be permitted subject in particular to compliance with the conditions referred to in Directive 2005/94/EC. In such cases, the animal health certificates provided for in accordance with Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs [12] should include a reference to this Decision. 
(16) The dispatch from the control area of meat, minced meat, meat preparations and meat products derived from poultry and farmed feathered game produced in compliance with certain requirements of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption [13] and subject to official veterinary controls including ante- and post mortem inspection should be permitted. 
(17) The same official animal health controls apply for meat derived from poultry and farmed feathered game originating from the control area and produced in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005, which provides for transitional measures allowing the use of a national identification mark for products of animal origin intended for human consumption and which may only be marketed in the territory of the Member State where they are produced. 
(18) Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption [14] establishes a list of treatments rendering meat from restricted areas safe, and provides for the possibility to establish a specific health mark and the health mark required for meat not authorised for placing on the market for animal health reasons. It is appropriate to permit the dispatch from the control area of meat derived from poultry and farmed feathered game bearing the health mark provided for in that Directive and destined for treatment within the affected Member State to ensure inactivation of the avian influenza virus. Meat products having undergone such treatment may then be dispatched to other Member States and third countries. 
(19) It is necessary to limit the dispatch from the control area of animal by-products of avian origin to those complying with specific conditions for the production, use, treatment or disposal as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption [15] that prevent the possible spread of avian influenza virus. 
(20) It is necessary to specify the minimum duration of the measures provided for in this Decision which should take account of the incubation period of the disease and the requirements of Directive 2005/94/EC. However it is also necessary to introduce conditions for granting specific derogations following the positive outcome of a risk assessment by the competent authorities. 
(21) In the interests of clarity of Community legislation, Decision 2006/115/EC should be repealed and replaced by the present Decision. 
(22) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
Subject-matter and scope 
1. This Decision lays down certain protection measures to be applied in cases where highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the highly pathogenic influenza A virus of subtype H5 is detected and the neuraminidase type N1 (H5N1) is suspected or confirmed in wild birds, in a Member State (the affected Member State), in order to prevent the spread of avian influenza from wild birds to poultry or other captive birds, as well as the contamination of products thereof. 
2. This Decision shall apply without prejudice to: 
(a) Decision 2006/416/EC; or 
(b) Decision 2006/415/EC and other protective measures in relation to an outbreak of HPAI in poultry or other captive birds caused by an avian influenza virus of the subtype H5 where the neuraminidase type N1 is suspected or confirmed HPAI H5N1. 
Article 2 
Definitions 
For the purpose of this Decision, the definitions in Directive 2005/94/EC shall apply. 
The following definitions shall also apply: 
(a) "hatching eggs" means eggs for incubation laid by poultry as defined in Article 2(4) of Directive 2005/94/EC; 
(b) "wild feathered game" means, as far as avian species are concerned, game as defined in point 1.5, second indent, and in point 1.7 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004; 
(c) "other captive birds" means birds as defined in Article 2(6) of Directive 2005/94/EC, excluding: 
(i) pet animals of the bird species as referred to in Article 3(a) of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003; 
(ii) birds for zoos, circuses, amusement parks and experimental laboratories and sentinel birds placed by the competent authority in the frame of surveillance and research activities. 
Article 3 
Establishment of control and monitoring areas 
1. The affected Member State shall establish around the area where the presence of HPAI caused by avian influenza A virus of subtype H5 is confirmed in wild birds and the neuraminidase type N1 is either suspected or confirmed: 
(a) a control area with a radius of at least three kilometres (the control area); and 
(b) a monitoring area with a radius of initially at least 10 kilometres, including the control area (the monitoring area). 
2. The establishment of the control and the monitoring areas shall take account of geographical, limnological, administrative, ecological and epizootiological factors relating to the species of wild birds, the characteristics of the avian influenza viruses and the monitoring facilities. 
3. The affected Member State shall notify to the Commission and to the other Member States the details of any control and monitoring areas and shall, as appropriate, inform the public of the measures taken. 
4. If the control or the monitoring areas cover the territories of more than one Member State, the competent authorities of those Member States shall collaborate in order to establish those areas. 
5. If wild birds are suspected or confirmed to be infected with HPAI H5N1 in a protection or surveillance zone established pursuant to Article 11(1) of Decision 2006/416/EC (the protection or surveillance zones) due to such infection in poultry or other captive birds, the competent authority shall: 
(a) establish control and monitoring areas; and 
(b) undertake a risk assessment to consider whether the radius of the control and monitoring areas needs to be extended to overlap with the protection and surveillance zones. 
The competent authority may apply the protection measures provided for in Article 5(b), (c) and (d), in any parts of the protection and surveillance zones that do not overlap with the control and monitoring areas when the risk assessment indicates that there is a risk of spread of HPAI H5N1 to poultry or other captive birds in those parts. 
Article 4 
Derogations from measures provided for in Article 3(1) 
1. By way of derogation from Article 3(1), the affected Member State may refrain from the establishment of control and monitoring areas on basis of the favourable results of a risk assessment by the competent authority. 
That assessment shall take into account geographical considerations, the ecology of the infected bird species and lead the competent authority to conclude that HPAI H5N1 is not present in the area in poultry or other captive birds or wild birds, or that the infected wild bird did not present a risk of spreading that virus to poultry or other captive birds or wild birds in the locality. 
In those circumstances the competent authority shall attempt, where necessary in liaison with the competent authorities of other Member States or third countries, to establish with the help of ornithological experts whether the wild birds are resident or migrating, such that an assessment can be made as to whether HPAI H5N1 exists in wild birds in other areas under their jurisdiction. 
2. By way of derogation from Article 3(1) (a) and on the basis of favourable results to a risk assessment which has taken into account at least the criteria referred to in Article 3(2) and confirmed the existence of sufficient protection of the local poultry or other captive birds based on natural barriers or the absence of suitable habitats for wild birds presenting a risk of spreading HPAI H5N1 the control area may be: 
(a) amended to an area of sufficient size but in any event not less than of 1 km in radius; or 
(b) established as a band of 1 km in width from the banks of a river or the shores of a lake or coast for a length of at least 3 km. 
In this case and by way of derogation from Article 3(1)(b) the competent authority shall then also adapt the shape and the size of the monitoring area accordingly to separate the control area from the unaffected parts of the territory. 
Article 5 
Measures in the control area 
The affected Member State shall ensure that at least the following measures are applied in the control area: 
(a) the identification of all commercial poultry holdings and non-commercial holdings; 
(b) the implementation of the biosecurity measures laid down in Decision 2005/734/EC for poultry and other captive birds, including disinfection at the entrances and exits to premises where poultry or other captive birds are kept; 
(c) intensified official surveillance of wild bird populations, in particular water fowl, and further monitoring for dead or sick birds, if necessary with the co-operation of hunters and bird-watchers, and the reporting of dead bird findings to the competent authority and the removal, as far as possible, of carcasses of dead birds by personnel who have been specifically instructed on measures to protect themselves from infection with the virus and to prevent the spread of the virus to susceptible animals; 
(d) campaigns to inform the public and to increase disease awareness among owners of poultry or other captive birds, hunters, bird-watchers and those providing the services of water-related recreation; 
(e) periodic and documented visits to all commercial poultry holdings and targeted visits to non-commercial poultry holdings, prioritising those considered to be at greater risk, which must include: 
(i) a clinical inspection of the poultry or other captive birds including, if necessary, the collection of samples for laboratory examination targeting poultry or other captive birds that had not been confined prior to the positive finding in a wild bird and in particular ducks and geese; 
(ii) an assessment of the implementation of the biosecurity measures referred to in point (b). 
Article 6 
Prohibitions in the control area 
The affected Member State shall ensure that the following are prohibited in the control area: 
(a) the removal of poultry or other captive birds from the holding on which they are kept; 
(b) the assembly of poultry or other captive birds at fairs, markets, shows or other gatherings; 
(c) the transport through the control area of poultry or other captive birds, except transit through the control area by road or rail without unloading or stopping; 
(d) the dispatch of hatching eggs collected from holdings which on the date of collection were situated in the control area; 
(e) the dispatch from the control area of fresh meat, minced meat, meat preparations and meat products from poultry originating from the control area and wild feathered game taken from the wild in that area; 
(f) the transport or spread of unprocessed manure from holdings of poultry or other captive birds within the control area, except the transport for treatment in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002; 
(g) the dispatch to other Member States and third countries of animal by-products of avian origin derived from poultry or other captive birds or wild feathered game originating from the control area; 
(h) the hunting of wild birds or otherwise taking them from the wild, unless authorised by the competent authority for specific purposes; 
(i) the release of game birds from captivity into the wild. 
Article 7 
Measures in the monitoring area 
The affected Member State shall ensure that at least the measures provided for in Article 5(a) to (d) are applied in the monitoring area. 
Article 8 
Prohibitions in the monitoring area 
The affected Member State shall ensure that the following are prohibited in the monitoring area: 
(a) the removal of poultry or other captive birds out of the monitoring area for the first 15 days following the date of establishment of that area; 
(b) the assembly of poultry or other captive birds at fairs, markets, shows or other gatherings; 
(c) the hunting of wild birds or otherwise taking them from the wild, unless authorised by the competent authority for specific purposes; 
(d) the release of game birds from captivity into the wild. 
Article 9
