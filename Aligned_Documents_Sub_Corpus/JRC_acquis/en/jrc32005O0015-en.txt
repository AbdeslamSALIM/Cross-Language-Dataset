Guideline of the European Central Bank of 15 December 2005 amending Guideline ECB/2000/1 on the management of the foreign reserve assets of the European Central Bank by the national central banks and the legal documentation for operations involving the foreign reserve assets of the European Central Bank (ECB/2005/15) 
Guideline of the European Central Bank 
of 15 December 2005 
amending Guideline ECB/2000/1 on the management of the foreign reserve assets of the European Central Bank by the national central banks and the legal documentation for operations involving the foreign reserve assets of the European Central Bank 
(ECB/2005/15) 
(2005/951/EC) 
THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the third indent of Article 105(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and in particular the third indent of Article 3.1 and Articles 12.1, 14.3 and 30.6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Guideline ECB/2000/1 of 3 February 2000 on the management of the foreign reserve assets of the European Central Bank by the national central banks and the legal documentation for operations involving the foreign reserve assets of the European Central Bank [1] stipulates, inter alia, what legal documentation should be used for such operations. 
(2) Guideline ECB/2000/1 was amended on 11 March 2005 to reflect the ECB’s decision to use the Banking Federation of the European Union (Fédération Bancaire Européenne) (FBE) Master Agreement for Financial Transactions (Edition 2004) for collateralised and over-the-counter derivatives operations involving the ECB’s foreign reserve assets with counterparties incorporated or organised under the laws of certain European jurisdictions. 
(3) In respect of counterparties that are incorporated or organised under Swedish law, the ECB now considers that it would be appropriate to use the FBE Master Agreement for Financial Transactions (Edition 2004): 
(i) for all over-the-counter derivatives operations involving the ECB’s foreign reserve assets with such counterparties; and 
(ii) to document deposits involving the ECB’s foreign reserve assets with such counterparties provided that they are eligible for deposits as well as repo and/or FX transactions. 
(4) Guideline ECB/2000/1 should therefore be amended to provide for the use of the FBE Master Agreement for Financial Transactions (Edition 2004) for over-the-counter derivatives operations and deposits with counterparties that are incorporated or organised under Swedish law and consequently to reflect the ECB’s decision no longer to use the ECB Master Netting Agreement with such counterparties. 
(5) In accordance with Article 12.1 and Article 14.3 of the Statute, ECB guidelines form an integral part of Community law, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS GUIDELINE:
