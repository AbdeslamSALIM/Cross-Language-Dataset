ANNEX II 
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE TRANSFER OF COMPUTER FILES TO THE EAGGF FROM 16 OCTOBER 2005 
INTRODUCTION 
These technical specifications apply in respect of the financial year 2005, which commenced on 16 October 2004. 
1. Transfer medium 
The coordinating body of the Member State must transfer the computer files and the relating documentation to the Commission through STATEL/STADIUM. The Commission will only support one installation of STATEL/STADIUM per Member State. The latest STADIUM client and more information on the use of STATEL/STADIUM shall be downloaded from the CIRCA web-site of the EAGGF. 
2. Computer file structure 
2.1. The Member State must create a computer record for each individual component of the EAGGF (Guarantee Section) payments and receipts. These components are the individual items of which the payment (receipt) to (from) the beneficiary consists. 
2.2. The records must have a flat file structure. If fields have more than one value, separate records containing all data fields are required. Make sure that no double counting occurs [1]. 
2.3. All information for the same category of payments or receipts must be contained in the same computer file. Separate files relating to the same payments (e.g. for traders or inspections, or for basic and measure data) are not allowed. 
2.4. The computer files must have the following characteristics: 
1. The first record in the file (header row) contains the file description. The field names comprise an "F" followed by the field number used in Annex I (the "X-table"). Only field names existing in this Annex are allowed. 
2. The following records in the file are data (data rows), in the order indicated by the first record describing the file structure. 
3. The fields are separated by a semicolon (";"). The header row and data rows shall all contain the same number of semicolons. In the data rows, empty fields appear as a double semicolon (";;") within the record, or as a single semicolon (";") at the end of the record. 
4. Records vary in length. Each record ends with a code "CR LF" or "Carriage Return — Line Feed" (in hexadecimal: "0D 0A"). The header row never ends on a ";". Data rows only end on a ";" if the last field is empty. 
5. The file is in ASCII coding according to following table. Other codes (such as EBCDIC, TAR, ZIP, etc.) are not accepted: 
code | Member State | 
ISO 8859-1 | BE, DK, DE, ES, FR, IE, IT, LU, NL, AT, PT, FI, SE and GB | 
ISO 8859-2 | CZ, HU, PL, SI and SK | 
ISO 8859-3 | MT | 
ISO 8859-7 | GR and CY | 
ISO 8859-13 | EE, LV and LT | 
6. Numeric fields: 
(a) Decimal separator: "." 
(b) The symbol ("+" or "-") appears on the far left, followed immediately by the figures. For positive numbers, the "+" sign is optional. 
(c) Fixed number of decimals (the details are set out in the Annex III hereto). 
d) No spaces between digits. No spaces or other signs between thousands. 
7. Date field: "YYYYMMDD" (year in four digits, month in two digits, day in two digits). 
8. EAGGF budget code (field F109) ABB-format without spaces: "999999999999999" (where "9" stands for any figure between 0 and 9). 
9. Quotation marks (" ") are not allowed at the beginning or at the end of the records. The semicolon field separator ";" must not be used in data in text format. 
10. All fields: no spaces at the beginning or end of a field. 
11. Files satisfying these rules will look like the following (example for financial year 2004): 
F100;F101;F106;F107;F108;F109 
BE01;154678;+152.50;EUR;20030715;050201011000001 
BE01;024578;-1000.00;EUR;20030905;050208031502002 
BE01;154985;9999.20;EUR;20030101;050205011100001 
BE01;100078;+152.75;EUR;20030331;050208091515002 
BE01;215452;+0.50;EUR;20030615;050201011000002 (Please note +0.50 and not +.50) 
BE01;123456;21550.15;EUR;20030101;050805013810001 
etc. 
(other data rows with the fields in the same order). 
2.5. Data files with the characteristics as described under 2.4 shall be sent with consignment type "X-TABLE-DATA" (see "STADIUM client"). 
2.6. The computer program for checking the format of computer files before sending them to the Commission ("WinCheckCsv") is included in the data transfer program ("STADIUM client"). The paying agencies are invited to download the check program from CIRCA separately for offline validation purposes. 
3. Documentation 
In the following cases only, the coordinating body of the Member State must transfer an explanatory note for each paying agency through STATEL/STADIUM: 
1. In the case where there are differences between the annual declaration [2], as part of the annual financial clearance procedure (not table 104), and the sum of the records in the computer files (Σ F106), in order to explain them by budget sub item. The STADIUM client includes a specific consignment type for this transfer i.e. "EXPLANATORY-NOTE". 
2. In the case where there are codes used for fields, for which Annex III does not enforce standard codes, in order to explain all these used codes. The STADIUM client includes a specific consignment type for this kind of tabular transfer i.e. "CODE-LIST". 
The explanatory note shall have the look and feel of an ordinary letter. In particular the identity of the sender or the identity of the paying agency and the name or administrative unit of the addressee shall be clearly marked. 
4. Data transfer 
The coordinating body must send the computer files completely and only once. 
If the coordinating body notices that false data were transmitted or a problem occurred with the data transfer, the Commission has to be informed immediately. All files, which contain incorrect information, are to be indicated. Therefore, the Commission is to be asked to delete these files. Thereafter, in order to avoid an overlapping of computer records or data files, the coordinating body must send the corrected computer files to replace entirely the previous incorrect information. 
[1] Note: You should first read the preliminary remark concerning "quantities" in chapter 5 of Annex III. 
[2] Annual declaration: data sent through STATEL/STADIUM using consignment type "ANNUAL_DECLARATION".

F802: customs office of placing under customs supervision 
The Member States must use the Transit Customs Office List (COL [2]). This is the list of authorised customs offices for Community/common transit operations. It may be that due to its objective of "transit operations" some of the customs offices might be missing although this will be the exception. In that case the Member State shall provide the name of the customs office in full. 
Required format: The format of the COL code consists of two positions to denote the country followed by a six-character code that define the customs office. For instance "EE1000EE".

Indicate the customs office, which certifies that products covered by refund applications have left the customs territory of the Community. The Member States must use the Transit Customs Office List (COL [3]). This is the list of authorised customs offices for Community/common transit operations. It may be that due to its objective of "transit operations" some of the customs offices might be missing although this will be the exception. In that case the Member State shall provide the name of the customs office in full. 
This information is vital for the auditors in connection with the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 386/90 concerning substitution checks. The information is available in T5 or equivalent documents.

In view of harmonisation, the Member States shall also use the miscellaneous category (codes Q*) of the nomenclature of countries and territories for the external trade statistics. It is known that that nomenclature does not cover all special export refund cases but the Commission does not require that kind of detail. Member States shall therefore convert their special national codes to the broader categories of the nomenclature of countries and territories for the external trade statistics before sending their data to the Commission. 
F808: date of advance fixing
