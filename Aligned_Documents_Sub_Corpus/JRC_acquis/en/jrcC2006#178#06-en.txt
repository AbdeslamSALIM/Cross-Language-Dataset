(Case C-517/04) [1] 
Referring court 
College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven 
Parties to the main proceedings 
Applicant: Visserijbedrijf D.J. Koornstra %amp% Zn. vof 
Defendant: Productschap Vis 
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — College van Beroep voor het bedrijfsleven — Compatibility with Community law, in particular Articles 25 EC and 90 EC, of a charge imposed in a Member State on operators landing shrimp with a vessel registered in that State — Charge also payable by such an operator in respect of shrimp transported elsewhere in the Community — Charge intended to finance shrimp sieving and peeling in that State — Charge having an equivalent effect — Whether a charge applicable to operators or to products 
Operative part of the judgment 
A charge levied by an association governed by public law of a Member State, on the basis of identical criteria, on national products intended for the national market or for export to other Member States constitutes a charge having an effect equivalent to an export duty, prohibited by Articles 23 EC and 25 EC, if the revenue from that charge is used to finance activities which benefit only the national products intended for the national market and the advantages stemming from the use of the revenue from that charge fully offset the burden borne by those products. On the other hand, if the advantages accruing to the national products processed or marketed on the national market from the use of the revenue generated by that charge offset only partially the burden borne by those products, such a charge would constitute a breach of the prohibition on discrimination laid down by Article 90 EC.
