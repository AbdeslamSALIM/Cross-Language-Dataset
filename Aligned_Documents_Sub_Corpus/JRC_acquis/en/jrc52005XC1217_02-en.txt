Notice of initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain tungsten electrodes originating in the People's Republic of China 
Notice of initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain tungsten electrodes originating in the People's Republic of China 
(2005/C 322/07) 
The Commission has received a complaint pursuant to Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community ("the basic Regulation") [1], as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 461/2004 [2], alleging that imports of certain tungsten electrodes, originating in the People's Republic of China ("the country concerned"), are being dumped and are thereby causing material injury to the Community industry. 
1. Complaint 
The complaint was lodged on 4 November 2005 by Eurometaux ("the complainant") on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 25 %, of the total Community production of certain tungsten electrodes. 
2. Product 
The product allegedly being dumped is certain tungsten electrodes (including tungsten bars and rods), other than those obtained simply by sintering, whether or not cut to length originating in the People's Republic of China ("the product concerned"), normally declared within CN codes ex81019500 and ex85159090. These CN codes are only given for information. 
3. Allegation of dumping 
In view of the provisions of Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation, the complainant established normal value for the People's Republic of China on the basis of the price in a market economy country, which is mentioned in point 5.1(d).The allegation of dumping is based on a comparison of normal value, thus calculated, with the export prices of the product concerned when sold for export to the Community. 
On this basis, the dumping margin calculated is significant. 
4. Allegation of injury 
The complainant has provided evidence that imports of the product concerned from the People's Republic of China have increased overall in absolute terms and in terms of market share. 
It is alleged that the volumes and the prices of the imported product concerned have, among other consequences, had a negative impact on the market share held, the quantities sold and the level of prices charged by the Community industry, resulting in substantial adverse effects on the overall performance and the financial situation of the Community industry. 
5. Procedure 
Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that the complaint has been lodged by or on behalf of the Community industry and that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a proceeding, the Commission hereby initiates an investigation pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation. 
5.1. Procedure for the determination of dumping and injury 
The investigation will determine whether the product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China is being dumped and whether this dumping has caused injury. 
(a) Sampling 
In view of the apparent large number of parties involved in this proceeding, the Commission may decide to apply sampling in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. 
(i) Sampling for exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China 
In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling is necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all exporters/producers, or representatives acting on their behalf, are hereby requested to make themselves known by contacting the Commission and providing the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 6(b)(i) and in the format indicated in point 7: 
- name, address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers and contact person, 
- the turnover in local currency and the volume in tonnes of the product concerned sold for export to the Community during the period 1 October 2004 to 30 September 2005, 
- the turnover in local currency and the sales volume in tonnes for the product concerned on the domestic market during the period 1 October 2004 to 30 September 2005, 
- whether the company intends to claim an individual margin [3] (individual margins can only be claimed by producers), 
- the precise activities of the company with regard to the production of the product concerned, 
- the names and the precise activities of all related companies [4] involved in the production and/or selling (export and/or domestic) of the product concerned, 
- any other relevant information that would assist the Commission in the selection of the sample, 
- by providing the above information, the company agrees to its possible inclusion in the sample. If the company is chosen to be part of the sample, this will imply replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of its response. If the company indicates that it does not agree to its possible inclusion in the sample, it will be deemed to not have cooperated in the investigation. The consequences of non-cooperation are set out in point 8 below. 
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for the selection of the sample of exporters/producers, the Commission will, in addition, contact the authorities of the exporting country, and any known associations of exporters/producers. 
(ii) Final selection of the sample 
All interested parties wishing to submit any relevant information regarding the selection of the sample must do so within the time limit set in point 6(b)(ii). 
The Commission intends to make the final selection of the sample after having consulted the parties concerned that have expressed their willingness to be included in the sample. 
Companies included in the sample must reply to a questionnaire within the time limit set in point 6(b)(iii) and must cooperate within the framework of the investigation. 
If sufficient cooperation is not forthcoming, the Commission may base its findings, in accordance with Articles 17(4) and 18 of the basic Regulation, on the facts available. A finding based on facts available may be less advantageous to the party concerned, as explained in point 8. 
(b) Questionnaires 
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the Community industry and to any association of producers in the Community, to the sampled exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China, to any association of exporters/producers, to the importers, to any association of importers named in the complaint, and to the authorities of the exporting countries concerned. 
Exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China claiming an individual margin, with a view to the application of Articles 17(3) and 9(6) of the basic Regulation, must submit a completed questionnaire within the time limit set in point 6(a)(ii) of this notice. They therefore have to request a questionnaire within the time limit set in point 6(a)(i) of this notice. However, such parties should be aware that if sampling is applied to exporters/producers, the Commission may nonetheless decide not to calculate an individual margin for them, if the number of exporters/producers is so large that individual examination would be unduly burdensome and would prevent the timely completion of the investigation. 
(c) Collection of information and holding of hearings 
All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known, submit information other than questionnaire replies and to provide supporting evidence. This information and supporting evidence has to reach the Commission within the time limit set in point 6(a)(ii). 
Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. This request must be made within the time limit set in point 6(a)(iii). 
(d) Selection of the market economy country 
In accordance with Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, it is envisaged to choose the United States of America as an appropriate market economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People's Republic of China. Interested parties are hereby invited to comment on the appropriateness of this choice within the specific time limit set in point 6(c). 
(e) Market economy status 
For those exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China who claim and provide sufficient evidence that they operate under market economy conditions, i.e. that they meet the criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, normal value will be determined in accordance with Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation. Exporters/producers intending to submit duly substantiated claims must do so within the specific time limit set in point 6(d). The Commission will send claim forms to all exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China named in the complaint and to any association of exporters/producers named in the complaint, as well as to the authorities of the People's Republic of China. 
5.2. Procedure for assessment of Community interest 
In accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation and in the event that the allegations of dumping and injury caused thereby are substantiated, a decision will be reached as to whether the adoption of anti-dumping measures would not be against the Community interest. For this reason the Community industry, importers, their representative associations, representative users and representative consumer organisations, provided that they prove that there is an objective link between their activity and the product concerned, may, within the general time limits set in point 6(a)(ii), make themselves known and provide the Commission with information. The parties which have acted in conformity with the precedent sentence may request a hearing setting the particular reasons why they should be heard within the time limit set in point 6(a)(iii). It should be noted that any information submitted pursuant to Article 21 will only be taken into account if supported by factual evidence at the time of submission. 
6. Time limits 
(a) General time limits

Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the aforementioned period. 
Companies selected in a sample must submit questionnaire replies within the time limits specified in point 6(b)(iii). 
(iii) Hearings 
All interested parties may also apply to be heard by the Commission within the same 40 day time limit. 
(b) Specific time limit in respect of sampling 
(i) The information specified in point 5.1(a)(i) should reach the Commission within 15 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union, given that the Commission intends to consult parties concerned that have expressed their willingness to be included in the sample on its final selection within a period of 21 days of the publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
(ii) All other information relevant for the selection of the sample as referred to in 5.1(a)(ii) must reach the Commission within a period of 21 days of the publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union.

(c) Specific time limit for the selection of the market economy country 
Parties to the investigation may wish to comment on the appropriateness of the United States of America which, as mentioned in point 5.1(d), is envisaged as a market-economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People's Republic of China. These comments must reach the Commission within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
(d) Specific time limit for submission of claims for market economy status and/or for individual treatment

8. Non-cooperation
