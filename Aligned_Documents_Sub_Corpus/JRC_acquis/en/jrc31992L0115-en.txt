COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/115/EEC of 17 December 1992 amending for the first time Directive 88/344/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on extraction solvents used in the production of foodstuffs and food ingredients 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas Article 2 (5) of Directive 88/344/EEC (4) provides that within two years of the adoption of that Directive the Commission shall, after consulting the Scientific Committee for Food, re-examine the provisions relating to the solvents in the Annex and to Methyl-propan-2-ol and propose any necessary amendments; 
Whereas as part of this amendment the Council should decide whether the residues of the extraction solvents in Part III of the Annex should refer to flavourings rather than foodstuffs; 
Whereas, three years after the adoption of Directive 88/344/EEC, the Commission should submit any appropriate proposal to the Council for some of the solvents in Article 2 (6), regulated so far only by national legislations; 
Whereas the Scientific Committee for Food reconsidered all the extraction solvents mentioned in that Directive in 1990 and in 1991 with the aim of replacing the temporary acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) established in 1981 with permanent assessments; whereas this has not always been possible, as appropriate information, although requested, has not been provided; whereas on the basis of the information received, the Scientific Committee for Food decided to confirm its acceptance or to retain the temporary status or to withdraw its previous temporary approval, depending on the substance concerned,
