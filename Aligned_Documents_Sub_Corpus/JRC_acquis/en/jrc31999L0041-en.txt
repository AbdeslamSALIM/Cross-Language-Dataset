Directive 1999/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 June 1999 amending Directive 89/398/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses 
DIRECTIVE 1999/41/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
of 7 June 1999 
amending Directive 89/398/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2), 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 18 March 1999, 
(1) Whereas Article 4 of Directive 89/398/EEC(4) provides that specific provisions applicable to the groups of foods appearing in Annex I thereto are to be laid down by means of specific Directives; 
(2) Whereas to date specific Directives have been adopted for infant formulae and follow-on formulae(5), for processed cereal-based foods and baby foods intended for infants and young children(6) and for foods intended for use in energy-restricted diets for weight reduction(7); whereas there are reasons relating to public health for adopting specific provisions, in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 89/398/EEC, for dietary foods for special medical purposes and foods intended to meet the expenditure of intense muscular effort, especially for sportsmen, as referred to in Annex I to that Directive; 
(3) Whereas, in the case of the groups of low-sodium foods, including low-sodium or sodium-free dietary salts, and gluten-free foods, such products can be satisfactorily placed on the market and be efficiently monitored officially under the general provisions of Directive 89/398/EEC, provided that the conditions for the use of certain terms used to indicate the paticular nutritional properties of products are defined; 
(4) Whereas the deletion of those categories from Annex I to Directive 89/398/EEC would be in line with the efforts being made to avoid unnecessarily detailed legislation; 
(5) Whereas it is not clear whether an adequate basis exists for specific provisions to be adopted for the group mentioned in point 9 of Annex I to Directive 89/398/EEC, namely the group of foods intended for persons suffering from carbohydrate-metabolism disorders (diabetes); 
(6) Whereas therefore advice should be obtained from, inter alia, the Scientific Committee for Food before a final decision is taken on the question; 
(7) Whereas it is still possible to harmonize at Community level rules applicable to other groups of foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses, in the interest of consumer protection and the free movement of such foodstuffs, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
