Case T-162/06: Action brought on 26 June 2006 — Kronoply v Commission 
Action brought on 26 June 2006 — Kronoply v Commission 
Parties 
Applicant: Kronoply GmbH %amp% Co KG (Heiligengrabe, Germany) (represented by: R. Nierer and L. Gordalla, lawyers) 
Defendant: Commission of the European Communities 
Form of order sought 
- Annul the Commission's decision of 21 September 2005 regarding State aid No C 5/2004 (ex N 609/2003) by which the Commission declares the aid Germany wishes to grant the applicant to be incompatible with the common market; 
- Order the Commission to bear its own costs and to pay those of the applicant. 
Pleas in law and main arguments 
The applicant is contesting Commission Decision C(2005) 3497 of 21 September 2005 in which the Commission decided that the investment grant which Germany intended to give Kronoply GmbH in the context of the multisectoral framework on regional aid for large investment projects [1] constitutes State aid which is incompatible with the common market. 
The applicant submits four pleas in law in support of its application. 
First, it complains that the Commission clearly erred as regards the findings of fact. In that respect it submits, inter alia, that the defendant did not ascertain the date on which the applicant applied for grants although it is of decisive importance with regard to an examination of the facts. Furthermore, it submits that the Commission overlooked the fact that the national administrative procedure has not yet been brought to an end. 
Secondly, the applicant submits in support of its application the plea that the contested decision is not adequately reasoned. 
Furthermore, the applicant submits that the Commission has infringed Article 87(3)(a) and (c) EC and Article 88 EC, Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 [2] and the Guidelines on national regional aid [3]. 
Lastly, the applicant complains of manifest errors of assessment and misuse of powers on the part of the defendant.
