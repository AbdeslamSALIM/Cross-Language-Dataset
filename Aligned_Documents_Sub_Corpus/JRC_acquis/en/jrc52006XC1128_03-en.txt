Notice of initiation of a review of the extension of the antidumping duty imposed on imports of bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China to imports of certain bicycle parts from the People's Republic of China 
(2006/C 289/04) 
The Commission has at its disposal sufficient evidence to initiate a review pursuant to Article 13(4) and 11(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (%quot%the basic Regulation%quot%) [1], as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2117/2005 [2]. 
1. Product 
The product under review is essential bicycle parts: 
- painted or anodized or polished and/or lacquered bicycle frames, currently classifiable within CN code ex87149110, 
- painted or anodized or polished and/or lacquered bicycle front forks, currently classifiable within CN code ex87149130, 
- derailleur gears, currently classifiable within CN code 87149950, 
- crank-gear, currently classifiable within CN code 87149630, 
- free-wheel sprocket-wheels, currently classifiable within CN code 87149390, whether or not presented in sets, 
- other brakes, currently classifiable within CN code 87149430, 
- brake levers, currently classifiable within CN code ex87149490, whether or not presented in sets, 
- complete wheels with or without tubes, tyres and sprockets, currently classifiable within CN code ex87149990, and 
- handlebars, currently classifiable within CN code 87149910, whether or not presented with a stem, brake and/or gear levers attached, 
originating in the People's Republic of China (%quot%the product concerned%quot%). The above mentioned CN codes are only given for information. 
2. Existing measures 
The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93 [3] and maintained by Regulation (EC) 1524/2000 [4] on imports of bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China (%quot%PRC%quot%), as extended by Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97 [5] to imports of certain bicycle parts from the PRC. 
The extension of the measures to imports of certain bicycle parts from the PRC resulted from an investigation into the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping duties imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93 through the assembly of bicycles, using bicycle parts originating in the PRC, in the Community. The investigation found that circumvention was taking place and the measures imposed on imports of bicycles from the PRC were extended to imports of parts from that country (%quot%the extended measures%quot%). 
3. Grounds for the review 
Since the extension of the measures to imports of certain bicycle parts, the Commission has granted requests for exemption from the extended measures to a large number of companies based in the Community. The Commission has continued to receive requests for an exemption from the extended measures and the current number of parties requesting an exemption is significant. At the same time there are no apparent indications of circumvention practices by companies having been granted an exemption. 
Furthermore, the Commission has at its disposal sufficient prima facie evidence that if the extension of the measures on imports of bicycles to imports of certain bicycle parts was removed, there would be no continuation or recurrence of circumvention practices. 
4. Procedure 
Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of a review of the extension of the measures to imports of certain bicycle parts, the Commission hereby initiates a review in accordance with Article 13(4) and 11(3) of the basic Regulation. 
The investigation will assess the need for the continuation of the extension of the anti-dumping duty imposed on bicycles originating in the PRC to imports of certain bicycle parts from the PRC. 
(a) Sampling 
(i) Sampling for Community producers/assemblers of bicycles 
In view of the apparent large number of parties involved in this review investigation, the Commission may decide to apply sampling in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. 
In order to enable the Commission to select a sample, all Community producers/assemblers [6] of bicycles are hereby requested to provide the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 5(b)(i): 
- name, address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers and contact person,

- the total cost in EUR of bicycle parts produced by the company during the calendar years 2003, 2004, 2005 and for the period from 1st October 2005 to 30 September 2006, 
- the total value in EUR of bicycle parts of Chinese origin imported or purchased by the company during the calendar years 2003, 2004, 2005, and for the period from 1st October 2005 to 30 September 2006,

- the names and the precise activities of all related companies [7] involved in the production and/or selling of bicycles and of the product concerned, 
- any other relevant information that would assist the Commission in the selection of the sample, 
- by providing the above information, the company agrees to its possible inclusion in the sample. If the company is chosen to be part of the sample, this will imply replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of its response. If the company indicates that it does not agree to its possible inclusion in the sample, it will be deemed to not have co-operated in the investigation. The consequences of non-cooperation are set out in point 7 below. 
(ii) Final selection of the sample 
All interested parties wishing to submit any relevant information regarding the selection of the sample must do so within the time limit set in point 5(b)(ii). 
The Commission intends to make the final selection of the sample after having consulted the parties concerned that have expressed their willingness to be included in the sample. 
Companies included in the sample must reply to a questionnaire within the time limit set in point 5(b)(iii) and must cooperate within the framework of the investigation. 
If sufficient co-operation is not forthcoming, the Commission may base its findings, in accordance with Articles 17(4) and 18 of the basic Regulation, on the facts available. A finding based on facts available may be less advantageous to the party concerned, as explained in point 7. 
(b) Questionnaires 
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the sampled Community producers/assemblers of bicycles in the Community. This information and supporting evidence should reach the Commission within the time limit set in point 5(b)(iii). 
(c) Collection of information and holding of hearings 
All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known, submit information other than questionnaire replies and to provide supporting evidence. This information and supporting evidence must reach the Commission within the time limit set in point 5(a)(i). 
Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. This request must be made within the time limit set in point 5(a)(ii). 
5. Time limits 
(a) General time limits 
(i) For parties to make themselves known, to submit questionnaire replies and any other information
