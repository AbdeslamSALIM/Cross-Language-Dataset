COMMISSION REGULATION (EC, Euratom) 
amending Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. BACKGROUND 
On 3 May 2005, the Commission adopted the proposal on the revision of the Financial Regulation. On that occasion, the Commission noted that it would not be appropriate to include other items such as the simplification of low-value calls for tender in the field of external aid, in the then ongoing fast-track revision of the detailed rules for implementing the Financial Regulation in order not to delay its adoption, given that the interinstitutional consultation had already taken place. Nevertheless, the Commission "undertook to return to this matter in the next revision of the implementing rules, so that the changes could be introduced as early as possible". 
With this in mind, the following draft regulation on the revision of the implementing rules for the Financial Regulation deals with technical amendments which can be introduced under the current Financial Regulation, as requested by the Commission in the minutes of its meeting of 3 May. They aim mainly at further simplifying the administrative procedures for the institutions, economic operators and beneficiaries of grants, in particular in external actions, while maintaining a high level of protection of the Communities’ financial interests in the light of the risks involved. 
2. AMENDMENTS CONSIDERED NECESSARY 
2.1. Budgetary principles 
Under the principle of unity, the Commission must inform the budgetary authority by 15 April of the cancellation of carried-over appropriations which have not been committed by 31 March. The 15 April deadline has proved to be too strict and should be replaced by 15 May (Article 6). 
In connection with the principle of annuality , for the purpose of applying the provisional twelfths, it should be specified that the maximum in terms of the allotted appropriations of the previous financial year has to be understood as appropriations within the meaning of Article 5 IR, after adjustment for the transfers made during that financial year (Article 6a). 
In relation to the principle of the unit of account , it should be clarified that the rules on the rate of conversion between the euro and other currencies contained in Articles 7 and 8 IR only apply to conversions carried out by authorising officers and not to conversions carried out by contractors or beneficiaries following the specific rules agreed in contracts or grant agreements. For reasons of efficiency and simplification, the Commission's accounting officer should establish the monthly accounting exchange rate for the euro to be used for accounting purposes (Article 7(3)IR), as this competence is strictly linked with his duty of preparing and presenting the accounts under Article 61(1) FR. In addition, for reasons of transparency and equal treatment of Community officials, a specific rule on conversion rates is established in Article 8 for staff expenditure paid in a currency other than the euro. 
As regards the principle of sound financial management , the content of an ex ante evaluation should be clarified and the scope of ex ante , interim and ex post evaluation should be better targeted, having due regard to the principle of proportionality. The priorities of the evaluation should thus be redirected in order to focus on proposals with a real impact on business and citizens. It is also appropriate to include in the evaluation pilot projects and preparatory actions if it is proposed to continue them as a programme. In addition, where projects or actions are already subject to evaluation (e.g. tasks shared between the Commission, Member States) such evaluation should not be duplicated (Article 21). 
2.2. The accounting officer 
Following the introduction of accrual accounting on 1 January 2005, as the accounting data are available at any moment in the informatics system, it is more logical and quicker to draw up the trial balance the day on which the accounting officer terminates his duty. If he terminates his/her duty on 31 December, the trial balance could be prepared the same day without waiting for the finalisation of the provisional accounts (Article 56). 
In order to render effective the accounting officer's responsibility for treasury management, he should be authorised to communicate to financial institutions with which he has opened accounts the names and specimen signatures of the officials authorised to sign banking operations (Article 60). 
Article 64 needs to be adjusted to take account of the developments of the third-party files managed by the accounting officer's staff in order to be able to ascertain at any moment the financial position of third parties with whom the Commission incurs expenses or conducts operations. 
2.3. Imprest accounts 
The maximum amount which can be paid by the imprest administrator, when payments by budgetary procedures are materially impossible or less effective, should be reasonably increased. At the same time, the accounting officer should be authorised to lay down the detailed instructions on the means of payment which can be used by the imprest administrators (Article 67). 
2.4. Liability of the financial actors 
The provision on confirmation of instructions received by an authorising officer by delegation or sub-delegation should be brought into line with Article 21a of the Staff Regulations. Where an instruction is confirmed, the authorising officer by delegation or sub-delegation should also be allowed not to carry it out if it is manifestly illegal (Article 73). 
2.5. Recovery of debts 
The rules on recovery of debts should be clarified and strengthened in the light of recent case law and in order to safeguard better the financial interests of the Union. 
Recovery by offsetting has to be streamlined (Article 83). Given the complementary roles of the authorising officer and the accounting officer in the recovery procedure, it is justified to provide for a consultation between them before offsetting. This consultation does not affect the responsibility of the accounting officer to proceed with offsetting once the conditions are met but it may be useful, for example in order to ascertain the identity of the debtor/creditor where several creditors are involved. Recovery by offsetting before the end of the deadline within which if the debtor pays saves himself the interest ("period of grace") should be limited only to the cases where the accounting officer considers that the financial interests of the Community are at stake. 
The provision on bank guarantees concerning fines , periodic penalty payments and other penalties, in case of appeal by the debtor, should be adapted (Article 85a). In order to protect the financial interests of the Communities, it is necessary to have a single system of guarantees securing a Community claim pending appeal against a fine. These guarantees should be independent of the obligation laid down in the contract irrespective of the national law applicable. The institutions would thus have the possibility of calling in these guarantees whenever it is deemed necessary or opportune. 
2.6. Expenditure operations 
The content of the financing decision , which has to be adopted before any budgetary and legal commitment for expenditure implementing a basic act, should be further specified (Article 90). For grants and procurement, it should be made clear that the work programme referred to in Article 110 FR constitutes a financing decision provided that it contains a sufficiently detailed framework. For that purpose, the notion of "essential elements" of an action involving expenditure from the budget should be defined in more detail in the IR so as to ensure uniform application and legal security for the authorising officers. 
For the purpose of ex ante verification for the authorisation of expenditure, a series of similar individual transactions relating to routine staff expenditure on salaries, pensions, reimbursement of mission expenses and medical expenses may be considered by the authorising office responsible to constitute a single operation. In that case, the authorising officer, in accordance with his risk assessment, must carry out appropriate ex post verification (Article 47). 
For the purpose of administrative simplification, the payment time limits for contracts and grant agreements which depend on the approval of a report or certificate should be revised in order to ascertain that payments are made on the basis of an approved report or certificate. Moreover, the time-limit for approval of a report related to a grant agreement involving actions which are particularly complex to evaluate should be brought into line with the current time limit for complex service contracts (Article 106). 
2.7. Public procurement and contracts 
The management of procurement and contracts with a value below the thresholds referred to in Directive 2004/18/EC should be further facilitated. The thresholds for low value contracts, dating from 1994, should be updated and raised. It should also be specified that all contracts with a value less than or equal to EUR 60 000 may be awarded after a negotiated procedure (Article 129 and consequently Articles 119, 126, 128, 146). This change will make the management of procedures clearer and simpler without affecting competition since the same number of candidates, selected by the contracting authority, will be invited to tender. 
In addition, the implementing rules should define more precisely the procedure to be followed for certain research and development service contracts and certain service contracts intended for broadcasting which are excluded from the scope of the Directive 2004/18/EC. In the light of the principle of transparency, these contracts may be awarded following a negotiated procedure after publication of a tender notice (Article 127). 
The documentary burden should be further alleviated for economic operators and the administrative departments of the institutions, thus reducing administrative costs. To this end, for all contracts below the thresholds of Directive 2004/18/EC and in the external field, depending on the risk assessment carried out by the contracting authority, economic operators should be able to participate in a procedure on the basis of a declaration on their honour stating that they are not in one of the situations giving grounds for exclusion from that procurement procedure. However, in line with the principles of the Directive, in order to better protect the financial interests of the Communities, for high-value contracts in the external field, the economic operator to whom the contract is to be awarded should nevertheless have to provide evidence confirming the initial declaration (Article 134). For the sake of clarity, it must be pointed out that all candidates and tenderers should always have to provide evidence that they are not in one of the situations giving grounds for exclusion from contracts awarded by the institutions on their own account with a value above the thresholds set out in Directive 2004/18/EC. Lastly, whenever a candidate or tenderer is required to provide evidence, the contracting authority may consider evidence provided by that candidate or tenderer in another procurement procedure launched by the same contracting authority and provided that the issuing date of the documents does not exceed six months (Article 134). Regarding the technical and economic capacity, the option of not requiring proof of these capacities should be allowed up to the thresholds appropriate for each type of contracts in the field of external actions (Article 135). 
In order to simplify the management of the procurement procedure for contracts awarded by the institutions on their own account with a value below EUR 60 000 and, in the external aid, for contracts awarded after a competitive negotiated procedure or on the basis of a single bid, the contracting authority should have the possibility to simplify the content of the tender documents (Article 130). In order to lighten the administrative burden, implementation of the contracts should be made easier, for example by providing scope to adapt the amount of the performance guarantee (Article 151) and waive the requirement for a guarantee in the event of pre-financing to a public body (Article 152), without, however, diminishing the level of protection of the Communities’ financial interests. 
2.8. Grants 
Certain provisions in the title on grants should be amended in order to simplify the procedures for grants and for grants of small amount (less than or equal to EUR 25 000), in accordance with the general principle of proportionality enshrined in the EC Treaty. 
As for the award of grants , in order to reduce the administrative burden, it should be accepted that the de jure or de facto monopoly of the beneficiary can be substantiated in the award decision. 
Access to EC financing should be facilitated by enhancing co-financing in kind (Article 172). The notion of bodies which pursue an aim of European general interest and may receive operating grants with no decrease in the event of renewal should include European bodies involved in promoting citizenship and innovation (Article 162). 
Procedures should also be simplified. Educational bodies – and not only secondary and higher education bodies – should no longer be subject to verification of their financial capacity (Article 176) and applicants should be informed as soon as possible of the rejection of their application (Article 179). Grant applications (Article 173) and agreements should be made easier for grants of a small amount (Article 164). The requirement for an external audit to be attached to the application should apply only to grants with a value of more than EUR 750 000 for actions and EUR 100 000 for operating grants. 
Rules on guarantees for pre-financing should be reinforced in order to protect the Communities’ financial interests while ensuring better proportionality with the risk involved. It should thus be specified that a pre-financing guarantee is required for any pre-financing exceeding 80% of the total amount of the grant and EUR 60 000, and that as a general rule the guarantee must cover the entire amount of pre-financing (Article 182). 
In order to take account of the rights of the other contributors, the implementation of the non-profit rule , in the case of operating grants to bodies which pursue an aim of general European interest should be limited to the percentage of co-financing corresponding to the Community contribution to the operating budget concerned if these bodies are also funded by public authorities which are themselves required to recover the percentage of the annual profit corresponding to their contribution. For the purpose of calculating the amount to be recovered, the percentage of the contributions in kind to the operating budget should not be taken into account (Article 165). 
2.9. Accounting 
The title on presentation of the accounts and accounting should be updated to take account of the adoption by the Commission's accounting officer in December 2004, pursuant to Article 133 of the Financial Regulation, of the accounting rules and methods and the harmonised chart of accounts . It is necessary to delete provisions in the text of the implementing rules which are unnecessary and may create confusion. 
2.10. Specific policy sectors in Part Two of the Financial Regulation 
The management framework for procurement in the external field should be simplified and made more efficient by taking into account the Court of Auditors' report on decentralised management. In particular, the competitive negotiated procedure should be improved in the same way as for low-value contracts and the negotiated procedure should be allowed in the event of two failures of a competitive negotiated procedure and in the event of one failure when the competitive negotiated procedure follows the unsuccessful use of a framework contract (Articles 241, 242, 243, 244, 245). 
The option of waiving the requirement for a guarantee in the case of pre-financing to a public body should be allowed and the performance guarantee should be required only in the event of procurement with a high value (Article 250). Moreover, the pre-information notice should be published as early as possible and not necessarily before the 31st of January(Article 240) and an evaluation committee or a contracting authority should be allowed to ask candidates and tenderers for clarification , as is the case for contracts awarded by the institutions on their own account (Article 252). 
Experience has shown that several provisions of the Implementing Rules (interest on delayed payments, rent guarantees) impede delegations in third countries in carrying out their normal activities. It is necessary to adapt the Implementing Rules to take account of obstacles resulting from national laws in third countries (Articles 86, 106 and 264). 
2.11. Offices 
The list of European offices should be supplemented to take account of Decision 2005/118/EC of the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice, Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the Ombudsman setting up a European Administrative School which is to be attached administratively to the European Communities Personnel Selection Office. 
Draft 
COMMISSION REGULATION (EC, Euratom) 
amending Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[1], and in particular Article 183 thereof, 
Having consulted the European Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor, 
Whereas: 
(1) The obligation for the Commission to inform the budgetary authority by 15 April of the cancellation of carried over appropriations which have not been committed by 31 March has proven to be too strict and it is therefore proposed to extend it by one month to 15 May. 
(2) It should be specified that where provisional twelfths regime are to be allocated, the maximum in terms of the allotted appropriations of the previous financial year is to be understood as referring to appropriations for the financial year after adjustment for any transfers made during that financial year. 
(3) It should be made clear that the rules on the rate of conversion between the euro and another currency set out in Articles 7 and 8 of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002[2] only apply to conversions carried out by authorising officers and not to those carried out by contractors or beneficiaries, on the basis of the specific rules agreed in contracts or grant agreements. For reasons of efficiency, the Commission's accounting officer should be authorised to establish the monthly accounting exchange rate of the euro to be used for accounts purposes. In addition, for reasons of transparency and equal treatment of Community officials, a specific rule on conversion rates is established in Article 8 for staff expenditure paid in a currency other than the euro. 
(4) As regards the principle of sound financial management , the content of the ex ante evaluation should be clarified and the scope of the ex ante , interim or ex post evaluation should be better targeted, having due regard to the principle of proportionality. The priorities of evaluation should thus be redirected in order to focus on proposals with an impact on business and/or citizens and to cover pilot projects and preparatory actions to be continued. In addition, when projects or actions are already subject to evaluation (e.g. tasks shared between the Commission and Member States), that evaluation should not be duplicated. 
(5) For the purpose of ex ante verification for the authorisation of expenditure, a series of similar individual transactions relating to routine staff expenditure on salaries, pensions, reimbursement of mission expenses and medical expenses may be considered by the authorising office responsible to constitute a single operation. In this case, the authorising officer, in accordance with his risk assessment, must carry out appropriate ex post verification. 
(6) It is appropriate to include in the report on negotiated procedures only the cases of the use of negotiated procedures which constitute exceptions to the normal procurement procedures. 
(7) Following the introduction of accrual accounting on 1 January 2005, and the availability of accounting data at any moment in the informatics system, it is more logical and quicker to draw up the trial balance the day on which the accounting officer terminates his duty. If he terminates his duty on a 31 December, the trial balance could be prepared the same day without waiting for the provisional accounts to be finalised. 
(8) In order to render effective the accounting officer's responsibility for treasury management, he should be authorised to communicate to financial institutions with which he has opened accounts the names and specimen signatures of the officials authorised to sign banking operations. 
(9) The maximum amount which can be paid by the imprest administrator should be increased from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 when payments by budgetary procedures are materially impossible or less effective. The accounting officer should be authorised to lay down the detailed instructions on the means of payment which can be used by the imprest administrators. 
(10) In the light of Article 21a of the Staff Regulations, the authorising officer by delegation or sub-delegation should, in case of confirmation of instruction, be allowed not to carry out the instruction if it is manifestly illegal. 
(11) Given the complementary roles of the authorising officers and the accounting officer in the process of recovery by offsetting, it is justified to provide for a consultation between them before offsetting, in particular when offsetting involves several debtors. 
(12) Recovery by offsetting before the end of the deadline within which if the debtor pays saves himself the interest ("period of grace") should be limited only to cases where the accounting officer considers that the financial interests of the Communities are at stake. 
(13) In order to protect the financial interests of the Communities, bank guarantees that secure a Community claim pending appeal against a fine should be completely independent of the obligation laid down in the contract, irrespective of the applicable national laws. 
(14) The content of the financing decision should be further specified. For grants and procurement, the notion of "essential elements" of an action involving expenditure from the budget should be defined in more detail. Moreover, it should be made clear that the work programme referred to in Article 110 of the Financial Regulation may constitute a financing decision provided that it contains a sufficiently detailed framework. 
(15) Where a global budgetary commitment is made, any authorising officer – not only the authorising officer by delegation – may be responsible for the legal commitments implementing the global commitment. 
(16) The payment time-limits for contracts and grant agreements which depend on the approval of a report or certificate should be revised in order to make ascertain that payments are made on the basis of an approved report or certificate. Moreover, the time-limit for approval of a report related to a grant agreement involving actions which are particularly complex to evaluate should be brought into line with the current time limit for complex service contracts. 
(17) The thresholds for low-value contracts, fixed in 1994, should be updated and raised from EUR 50 000 to EUR 60 000 and from EUR 13 800 to EUR 25 000 respectively. Moreover, it should be specified that all contracts with a value equal to or less than EUR 60 000 may be awarded after a negotiated procedure. 
(18) In addition, the implementing rules should define more precisely the procedure to be followed for certain research and development service contracts and certain service contracts intended for broadcasting which are excluded from the scope of the Directive 2004/18/EC on the coordination of procedures for the award of public work contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts[3]. In the light of the principle of transparency, these contracts may be awarded following a negotiated procedure after publication of a tender notice. 
(19) With a view to further simplifying the management of procurement procedure for all contracts not covered by Directive 2004/18/EC, i.e. below the thresholds laid down in that Directive and in the external field, depending on the contracting authority’s risk assessment, economic operators should be able to participate in a procedure on the basis of a declaration on their honour stating that they are not in one of the situations giving grounds for exclusion from that procurement procedure. However, in line with the principles of the Directive 2004/18/EC and in order to better protect the financial interests of the Communities, for high-value contracts in the external field, the economic operator to whom the contract is to be awarded should nevertheless have to provide evidence confirming the initial declaration. Whenever a candidate or tenderer is required to provide evidence, the contracting authority may also consider evidence provided by that candidate or tenderer in another procurement procedure launched by the same contracting authority, provided that the issuing date of the evidence does not exceed six months. 
(20) In order to simplify the management of the procurement procedure for contracts awarded by the institutions on their own account with a value below EUR 60 000 and, in the external aid, for contracts awarded after a competitive negotiated procedure or on the basis of a single bid, the contracting authority may limit the content of the tender documents to what is strictly necessary. 
(21) In external actions, the competitive negotiated procedure should be rendered more efficient and the negotiated procedure should be allowed in the event of two failures of a competitive negotiated procedure and in the event of one failure when the competitive negotiated procedure follows the unsuccessful use of a framework contract. The option of not requiring proof of technical and economic capacity should be allowed up to the thresholds appropriate in that specific policy area for each type of contract. In that case also, the authorising officer should be able to justify his choice. The evaluation committee or the contracting authority should have the option of asking candidates or tenderers to supply additional documents or clarify information, as provided for in the case of contracts awarded by the institutions on their own account. 
(22) In external actions, the legal framework for the procurement should also be simplified as regard the publication of the pre-information notice for international calls for tenders and the requirement of a performance guarantee. The pre-information notice should be published as early as possible and not necessarily before the 31st of January. Moreover, the performance guarantee should be required only in the event of procurement with a high value. The option of adapting the amount of the performance guarantee should be introduced, for the sake of proportionality, and a possibility should be given to the authorising officer to waive the requirement of a guarantee in the case of pre-financing to a public body, depending on his risk assessment. 
(23) With regard to the award of grants, in order to reduce the administrative burden, it should be accepted that the de jure or de facto monopoly of the beneficiary can be substantiated in the award decision. 
(24) The requirement to attach an external audit to the application shall apply only to applications for grants with a value equal to or more than EUR 750 000 for actions and to operating grants with a value equal to or more than EUR 100 000. 
(25) Co-financing in kind by beneficiaries should be made easier and the notion of bodies which pursue an aim of European general interest and which may receive operating grants should include European bodies involved in promoting citizenship or innovation. 
(26) Educational bodies – not only secondary and higher education bodies – should no longer be subject to the verification of their financial capacity, and applicants should be informed as soon as possible of the rejection of their application. 
(27) For grants of a small amount, applications and agreements should be limited to what is strictly necessary. 
(28) In the case of operating grants to bodies which pursue an aim of general European interest, the implementation of the non-profit rule should be limited to the percentage of co-financing corresponding to the Community’s contribution to the operating budget in order to take account of the rights of the other public contributors which are also required to recover the percentage of annual profit corresponding to their contribution. For the purpose of calculating the amount to be recovered, the percentage of the contributions in kind to the operating budget should not be taken into account. 
(29) In order to protect the Community's financial interests, the requirement of guarantees for pre-financing should apply to any pre-financing exceeding 80% of the amount of the grant and EUR 60 000 and must, as a general rule, correspond to the amount of pre-financing. 
(30) Where pre-financing is split, the requirement of a consumption of 70% of any earlier pre-financing should be removed. In the event the earlier pre-financing has not been entirely consumed, the amount of the new payment shall take into account the degree of implementation of the grant agreement. 
(31) Following the adoption by the Commission's accounting officer in December 2004, pursuant to Article 133 of the Financial Regulation, of the accounting rules and methods and the harmonised chart of accounts, the Title on presentation of the accounts and accounting should be updated to take out provisions which are no longer necessary and which may create confusion. 
(32) The list of European offices should be supplemented to take account of Decision 2005/118/EC of the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice, Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the Ombudsman of 26 January 2005 setting up a European Administrative School[4] which is presently attached administratively to the European Communities Personnel Selection Office. 
(33) Experience has shown that several provisions of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 create difficulties for delegations in third countries. It is necessary to adapt those provisions to take account of obstacles resulting from national laws in third countries, 
(34) Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly,
