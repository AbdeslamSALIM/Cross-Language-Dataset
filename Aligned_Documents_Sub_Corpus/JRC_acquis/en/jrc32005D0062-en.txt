THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption [1], and in particular Article 24(6) and Article 32(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 derogations may be granted regarding the disposal by on-site burning or burial of animal by-products in restricted circumstances. That Regulation also provides that no derogation may be granted in respect of animals suspected of being infected with a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) or in which the presence of a TSE has been officially confirmed. 
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 811/2003 of 12 May 2003 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the intra-species recycling ban for fish, the burial and burning of animal by-products and certain transitional measures [2] lays down implementing rules for the disposal of animal by-products by on-site burning or burial. 
(3) Commission Decision 2004/467/EC of 29 April 2004 laying down transitional measures to be applied by Cyprus and Estonia as regards on-site burning or burial of animal by-products under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council [3] provides for a derogation to these rules applicable until 1 January 2005. 
(4) Cyprus has informed the Commission that it will not have operational collection systems in place for animal by-products on 1 January 2005. It is therefore necessary to maintain the transitional measures laid down by Decision 2004/467/EC for a further period of time. 
(5) During the transitional period Cyprus should take the necessary measures to avoid endangering human or animal health and the environment as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 811/2003.
