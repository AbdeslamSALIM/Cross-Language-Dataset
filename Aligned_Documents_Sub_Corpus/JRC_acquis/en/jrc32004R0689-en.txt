amending Regulation (EC) No 414/2004 adopting specific measures with a view to adapting the arrangements for administering tariff quotas on banana imports as a result of the accession of new Member States on 1 May 2004 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,

Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 414/2004(2) adopted the measures required to identify in particular the traditional operators established in the Community who supplied the markets of the new Member States in 2000, 2001 and 2002, with a view to the measures to be adopted to adapt the arrangements for administering tariff quotas on banana imports as a result of the accession of new Member States on 1 May 2004. 
(2) Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 414/2004 specifies the supporting documents which operators must supply to the competent authorities in order to be recognised as traditional operators. In view of the difficulties encountered by operators in obtaining copies of the documents held by other operators to attest that the products have actually been released for free circulation in the country of destination, additional supporting documents which may be produced should be specified. These documents should attest in particular that the products have been dispatched to the country of destination and have been sold to an operator to supply the market of the country concerned. 
(3) The provisions of this Regulation are intended to take account of the transitional difficulties encountered by operators and may not prejudice any measures that might subsequently be adopted by the Commission for the purposes of administering the import arrangements in question. 
(4) Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 414/2004, and Article 7 thereof relating to notifications from the Member States, should therefore be amended accordingly, and the new provisions should apply from the date of entry into force of that Regulation. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,
