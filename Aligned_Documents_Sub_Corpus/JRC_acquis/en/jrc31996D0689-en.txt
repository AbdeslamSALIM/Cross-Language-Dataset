THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 76/625/EEC of 20 July 1976 concerning the statistical surveys to be carried out by the Member States in order to determine the production potential of plantations of certain species of fruit trees (1), last amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1057/91 (2), and in particular Articles 4 (4) and 9 thereof,

Whereas the characteristics of the survey are laid down in Article 2 of Directive 76/625/EEC and the detailed rules of application of that Article are drawn up according to the procedure provided for under Article 9 of that Directive; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
