COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3143/85 
of 11 November 1985 
on the sale at reduced prices of intervention butter intended for direct consumption in the form of concentrated butter 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (1) as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1298/85 (2), and in particular Article 6 (7) and 28 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 985/68 of 15 July 1968, laying down general rules for intervention on the market in butter and cream (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3521/83 (4), and in particular Article 7 (a) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 974/71 of 12 May 1971 on certain measures of conjunctural policy to be taken in agriculture following the temporary widening of the margins of fluctuation for the currencies of certain Member States (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2055/85 (6), and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1079/77 of 17 May 1977 on a coresponsibility levy and on measures for expanding the market in milk and milk products (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1302/85 (8), and in particular Article 4 thereof, 
Whereas the situation on the butter market in the Community is characterized by the existence of large stocks formed as a result of intervention on the butter market under Article 6 (1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68; 
Whereas the entire quantity of the butter constituting these stocks cannot be disposed of in normal conditions during the milk marketing year; whereas, in view of the attendant high costs, a prolongation of storage should be avoided; whereas measures should therefore be taken to encourage the disposal of the butter; 
Whereas consumption of this product can be increased by means of sales at reduced prices in the form of concentrated butter; whereas various Community measures containing provisions to this effect have been adopted since 1972; 
Whereas the situation on the butter market warrants the continuation and amplification of such measures; whereas, in the view of the size of public stocks, priority should be given to the disposal of the latter; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 649/78 (9), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1741/84 (10), introduced a system of sales at reduced prices for intervention butter intended for direct consumption in the form of concentrated butter; whereas, in the light of experience gained in the application of the said Regulation, numerous amendments should be made to the latter; whereas, for the sale of clarity, the said Regulation should be repealed and replaced by a new text; 
Whereas the reduction in the price of butter should be such as to result in an increase in its consumption in the form of concentrated butter and whereas, for this reason, the effect of the reduction should be felt fully at the level of direct consumption; 
Whereas measures should be taken to ensure differentiation at all stages of marketing between butter disposed of under the terms of this Regulation and other butters; whereas, to this effect, provisions should be adopted concerning the composition and description of concentrated butter; whereas, in order to ensure compliance with the aims of this Regulation, a time limit for the processing of this butter into concentrated butter and for its packaging should be fixed; 
Whereas, moreover, a sufficiently high rate for the butterfat content should be laid down; 
Whereas a supervisory system should be applied to ensure that the butter is not used for purposes other than those stipulated; whereas this Regulation should be included in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1687/76 of 30 June 1976 laying down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention (11), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2602/85 (12); whereas additional supervisory conditions should also be laid down in view of the specific character of the operation, particularly in connection with the processing of the butter and as regards the keeping of stock records by the parties concerned; whereas, however, these supervisory measures should take place at the stage immediately preceding the taking over by the retail sector; 
Whereas, in particular, butter purchased under this Regulation should not be diverted to the uses provided for by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 262/79 of 12 February 1979 on the sale of butter at reduced prices for processing into pastry products, ice cream and other foodstuffs (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3021/85 (2), and by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1932/81 of 13 July 1981 on the granting of aid for butter or concentrated butter for the manufacture of pastry products, ice cream or other foodstuffs (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 453/85 (4); 
Whereas the Member States should communicate to the Commission data relating to the disposal of butter under this Regulation; 
Whereas account should be taken of the value of the butter or concentrated butter as regards the monetary compenatory amounts fixed by virtue of Regulation (EEC) No 974/71; whereas, to this effect, provision should be made for the application of a coefficient to the said amounts applicable to the butter and concentrated butter as currently set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 343/85 of 24 May 1985 fixing the monetary compensatory amounts and certain coefficients and rates required for their application (5); 
Whereas, as regards financing, the expenditure occasioned by this additional disposal operation should be considered as resulting from one of the measures referred to in the first indent of Article 4 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1079/77; 
Whereas the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
1. Butter purchased in accordance with Article 6 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 which was placed in storage before a date to be determined shall be put up for sale at reduced prices for the purposes of direct consumption in the Community in the form of concentrated butter.

2. The sales arrangements provided for in this Regulation shall continue to apply for as long as public stocks of butter allow and at all events for a period ending no earlier than one year after the date on which notice of expiry, decided on in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68, has been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

- 125,5 kg of butter where the butter used has a fat content of less than 82 %. 
In the case of concentrated butter with a minimum butterfat content of less than 99,8 %, the aforesaid quantities shall be reduced proportionally by 1,23 kg and 1,26 kg respectively per percent difference between the minimum butterfat content of the concentrated butter produced and the aforesaid figure of 99,8 %.
