Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine 
COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1493/1999 
of 17 May 1999 
on the common organisation of the market in wine 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 36 and 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(4), 
Whereas: 
(1) the operation and development of the common market in agricultural products should be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy to include in particular a common organisation of agricultural markets which may take various forms depending on the product; 
(2) the aim of the common agricultural policy is to attain the objectives set out in Article 33 of the Treaty and in particular, in the wine sector, to stabilise markets and ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community concerned; these objectives may be attained by adjusting resources to needs, in particular through the pursuit of a policy for the adaptation of wine-growing potential and a quality policy; 
(3) the existing framework of the common organisation of the market in wine was established by Regulation (CEE) No 822/87(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1627/98(6); in the light of experience it would be appropriate to replace it in order to address the current situation in the wine sector, which is typified by the fact that, while structural surpluses are less frequent, surpluses on a multiannual basis are still possible, however, in particular owing to the sector's inherent potential for dramatic fluctuations in production from one harvest to the next; 
(4) the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements in 1995 has resulted both in a more open Community market in which traditional intervention measures have now lost much of their potential impact, and in less scope for subsidised exports, which means that Community producers need to improve their competitive performance; the majority of exports are already being effected without subsidy; 
(5) the most significant market problem currently facing certain parts of the Community wine sector is their limited ability to adapt sufficiently rapidly to competitive changes on both the internal and external market; the existing common organisation of the market has failed to offer solutions for wine-growing areas where production is clearly unable to find a remunerative market; there has been insufficient flexibility for those areas with expanding markets to allow scope for development; 
(6) in 1994 the Commission presented a proposal for the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine which was not, however, adopted; the market situation has changed since that proposal was made; 
(7) there should therefore be a reform of the common organisation of the market in wine to guarantee the necessary flexibility to adapt smoothly to new developments with the following broad aims: maintaining improved balance between supply and demand on the Community market; enabling the sector to become more competitive in the longer term; eliminating the availablility of intervention as an artificial outlet for surplus production; supporting the wine market and hence facilitating the continuation of supplies of wine distillates to those parts of the potable alcohol sector which traditionally use that alcohol; accommodating regional diversity; and formalising the potential role of producer organisations and sectoral organisations; 
(8) Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 was supplemented and implemented by Regulations (EEC) No 346/79(7), (EEC) No 351/79(8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1029/91(9), (EEC) No 460/79(10), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85(11), (EEC) No 465/80(12), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1597/83(13), (EEC) No 457/80(14), (EEC) No 458/80(15), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 596/91(16), (EEC) No 1873/84(17), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2612/97(18), (EEC) No 895/85(19), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3768/85(20), (EEC) No 823/87(21), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No1426/96(22), (EEC) No 1442/88(23), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 859/199(24), (EEC) No 3877/88(25), (EEC) No 4252/88(26), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1629/98(27), (EEC) No 2046/89(28), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2468/96(29), (EEC) No 2048/89(30), (EEC) No 2389/89(31), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2088/97(32), (EEC) No 2390/89(33), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2611/97(34), (EEC) No 2391/89(35), (EEC) No 2392/89(36), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1427/96(37), (EEC) No 3677/89(38), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2796/94(39), (EEC) No 3895/91(40), (EEC) No 2332/92(41), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1692/98 and (EEC) No 2333/92(42), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1429/96(43); those Regulations have been substantially amended several times; since further amendments are to be made, they should be recast in the interest of clarity, in a single text; 
(9) Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 made provision for the Council to lay down general rules for its application; this created a complex structure of layers of legislation; the aforementioned Regulations contained a large amount of technical detail which required frequent amendment; this Regulation should therefore, in general, contain all the necessary guidance for its application; the Council should confer all necessary implementing powers on the Commission in accordance with Article 211 of the Treaty; 
(10) the rules governing the common organisation of the market in wine are extremely complex; in some cases they do not take sufficient account of regional diversity; as far as possible the rules should therefore be simplified and policy developed and implemented as close as possible to the producer within a Community framework; 
(11) to capitalise on and consolidate the improved market balance, and to better align supply on demand for different types of product, there should be a framework of measures on the management of wine-growing potential, to include restrictions on planting in the medium term, premiums for the permanent abandonment of wine-growing and support for the restructuring and conversion of vineyards; 
(12) structural measures not directly related to the production of wine should fall within the scope of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and amending and repeating certain Regulations(44); measures related to promotion make an important contribution to the sector's competitive performance and notably the promotion of Community wine on third-country markets should be stimulated; however, in order to ensure consistency with the general promotion policy of the Community, measures related to the wine sector should fall within the scope of horizontal rules on this matter; for this purpose, the Commission has submitted a proposal for a Regulation on measures to promote and provide information on agricultural products in third countries(45); 
(13) market balance has improved, albeit in a relatively slow and difficult manner; whereas the existing restrictions on planting have shown themselves to be the essential component in this achievement; in the light of experience it does not seem possible to use any other measures to capitalise on and consolidate the improved market balance; it therefore seems necessary to control the use of producers' property in this manner in accordance with the general interest; 
(14) existing restrictions on planting should therefore remain in place for a period limited in the medium term so as to allow the full range of structural measures to take effect, and thus any planting of vines for wine production should be prohibited until 31 July 2010 unless otherwise permitted under this Regulation; 
(15) the existing permission for new planting of areas intended for graft nurseries, land consolidation and compulsory purchase as well as wine-growing experiments has shown itself not to unduly disturb the wine market and should therefore be continued subject to the necessary controls; for similar reasons, it should also be possible to plant vines, the production of which is intended for consumption by the wine-grower's family; 
(16) the existing permission for new planting to produce a quality wine produced in specified regions (quality wine psr) and table wine described by reference to a geographical indications has proved to be a useful component of the quality policy which is designed to better align supply on demand; however, once a reserve system of planting rights is fully functional, this latter system should fulfil this objective; the existing permission should therefore be continued, subject to the necessary checks, for a transitional period until 31 July 2003, by which time the reserve system should be fully functional; 
(17) the existing permission to replant vines is necessary to allow the normal renewal of exhausted vineyards; the existing system should therefore be maintained subject to the necessary checks; for greater flexibility the system should also permit, subject to the necessary checks, the acquisition and use of replanting rights before the related grubbing-up takes place; replanting rights acquired under prior Community or national legislation should be respected; furthermore, it should be possible to transfer replanting rights to another holding, subject to strict controls, provided that this transfer is in pursuit of quality or conerns the areas intended for graft nurseries or is connected with the transfer of part of the holding; in order to ensure the smooth running of the common organisation of the market, these transfers should be maintained within the same Member State; 
(18) in order to improve the management of wine-growing potential and to promote the efficient use of planting rights and thus to further mitigate the effect of the restrictions on planting, a system of national or regional reserves should be set up: 
(19) Member States should be given broad discretion in the management of the reserves, subject to the necessary controls, so as to permit them to better align the use of the rights to plant such reserves on local needs; this should include the opportunity to purchase planting rights, to fund the reserve and to sell planting rights from the reserve; to this end, Member States should be allowed not to apply the reserve system, provided that they can prove that they already have an efficient system of managing planting rights; 
(20) the grant of specific benefits to young wine producers may facilitate not only their establishment but also the structural adjustment of their holdings after their initial establishment; such producers should therefore be eligible for the grant of rights from the reserves free of charge; 
(21) to ensure that resources are used in the most efficient manner and to better align supply on demand, planting rights should be used by their holders within a reasonable time, or failing that, should be allocated or reallocated to the reserves; rights allocated to the reserves should be granted within a reasonable time for the same reasons; 
(22) in the light of the improved market balance and the expanding world market, there may be justification for increasing planting rights which should be allocated to the Member States concerned and, in part, to a Community reserve for allocation which is dependent on additional market demand; this increase should be reduced by the extent to which new planting rights have been authorised for quality wines psr and table wines designated with a geographical indication; 
(23) notwithstanding the existing restrictions on planting, areas have been planted in breach of those restrictions; the existing sanctions, which are designed to ensure that the products of such areas do not disrupt the wine market, have proved to be difficult to enforce; areas planted illegally should therefore be grubbed up; this requirement should be imposed in respect of all illegal planting which takes place after the proposal for this Regulation has been published, from which time producers should have been aware of the proposal to introduce the requirement; 
(24) without prejudice to any existing national measures, for reasons of legal certainty it is not possible to impose at Community level the grubbing-up requirement on areas planted in breach of restrictions before the proposal for this Regulation has been published; for better control of wine-growing potential, during a fixed period Member States should therefore be able to regularise the position of such areas, subject to the necessary controls; a different treatment may be provided for as far as regularisation is concerned, depending on the details of the planting in question, in particular where such planting is liable to lead to an increase in production; the producer involved may be subject to appropriate administrative penalties should such a risk occur; 
(25) Member States should be able to take account of local conditions and therefore be able to impose stricter rules in respect of new planting, replanting and grafting-on, where necessary; 
(26) there are wine-growing areas whose production is not aligned on demand; to encourage a better alignment of the sector as a whole, the permanent abandonment of wine-growing in such areas should be encouraged; a premium should therefore be granted to this end; the management of such a premium should be left to Member States to administer, whithin a Community framework and subject to the necessary controls, so as better to target the premium on the regions concerned; in particular Member States should therefore be able to designate the regions concerned and set the levels of the premium, using objective criteria and whitin an overall ceiling; 
(27) production in those Member States whose wine production is below 25000 hectolitres per year does not seriously affect the market balance; those Member States should therefore be exempt from the restrictions on planting but should not have access to the premium for permanent abandonment of wine-growing; 
(28) there are other wine-growing areas where production is not aligned on demand, but where production could be better aligned through restructuring of vineyards by varietal conversion, relocation of vineyards or improvement of vineyard management techniques; there should therefore be support to this end subject to the necessary controls; 
(29) to ensure that such restructuring and conversion are carried out in a controlled fashion, they should be planned; plans should be drawn up at a level as close as possible to the producer to ensure that regional diversity is taken into account; nevertheless, in order to ensure that the plans are in conformity with Community law, Member States should remain responsible in the last resort for those plans; 
(30) restructuring and conversion have two main financial impacts on the producer, namely loss of earnings during the period of conversion and the costs of implementing those measures; the support should therefore cover both of these impacts; in the restructuring process there is a place for additional national measures within specified limits; 
(31) it is desirable for a better management of wine-growing potential for an inventory of such potential to be compiled at Member State or at regional level; to encourage Member States to compile the inventory, access to the regularisation of unlawfully planted areas, the increase in planting rights and support for restructuring and conversion should be limited to those who have compiled the inventory; in the case of regional inventories, those regions which compiled the inventory should not be excluded from eligibility for the restructuring and conversion measures because other regions have not compiled an inventory; however, all the regional inventories must be completed by 31 December 2001; 
(32) the classification of vine varieties for wine production is a task best carried out as close as possible to the producer; Member States should therefore take over this task from the Community; 
(33) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2392/86 of 24 July 1986 establishing a Community vineyard register(46), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1631/98(47), should remain in force to enable those Member States who are still in the process of compiling it to complete the task; however, provision should be made for its subsequent amendment or repeal; 
(34) in order to preserve market balance, provision should be made for aid for the private storage of table wine and types of grape must; the measure should be as flexible and responsive to market movements as possible; to this end, it should therefore be possible in particular to terminate its application at short notice; 
(35) in order to eliminate the availability of intervention as an artificial outlet for surplus production there should be changes to the distillation system; there should therefore be the following forms of distillation: compulsory distillation of by-products of wine-making, compulsory distillation of wine produced from grapes not classified solely as wine grape varieties, a distillation measure to support the wine market by promoting continuity of supplies of wine distillates in parts of the potable alcohol sector which traditionally use that alcohol, and a crisis distillation measure; other forms of distillation should be abandoned; these measures should be as flexible as possible to respond to market needs and specific regional conditions; 
(36) in view of the poor quality of wine obtained from overpressing, this practice should be prohibited and provision should be made, in order to prevent it, for the compulsory distillation of marc and lees; however, derogations from this obligation may be envisaged in order to take account of conditions of production in certain wine-growing regions; in addition, since the production and market structures in wine-growing zone A and in the German part of wine-growing zone B are able to ensure that the aims of the measure are achieved, producers in these regions should not be obliged to distill by-products of wine-making but to withdraw such by-products under supervision; 
(37) the production of wine obtained from grapes not classified solely as wine-grapes varieties should be directed in the first instance towards traditional uses in the spirits sector and other traditional outlets; provisions should be made for the compulsory distillation of such wine produced in excess of the normal quantities directed towards such uses; 
(38) certain parts of the potable alcohol sector constitute an important traditional outlet for wine distillates and other wine-based products; there should therefore be Community support for distillation of table wine and wine suitable for yielding table wine to supply this market, in the form of a primary aid paid for distillation of such wines and a secondary aid for storage of the resulting distillate; 
(39) in order to deal with exceptional cases of market disturbance and serious quality problems, there should be a crisis distillation measure; the level and format of aid should be determined by the Commission to take account of specific situations, including cases where a noticeable fall in the market price for a category of wine has been noted; the measure should be voluntary for producers; if this measure is applied for three years in succession in respect of a particular category of wine (in a particular zone), the Commission should submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report and, where appropriate, proposals; 
(40) the disposal of alcohol obtained by distillation should be carried out in such a manner as to afford greater transparency and control and to avoid disturbance of traditional markets for alcohol; 
(41) the increase in the natural alcoholic strength by volume is not at present carried out under the same economic conditions by all Community producers on account of the various oenological practices allowed by this Regulation; in order to eliminate such discrimination, encouragement should be given to the use of vine products for enrichment, thereby increasing their outlets and helping to avoid wine surpluses; in order to achieve this, the prices of the various products for enrichment should be aligned; this result may be achieved by means of a system of aid for concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must coming from certain regions and used for enrichment; 
(42) it remains necessary, in order to achieve a more stable balance between production and use, to increase the use of vine products; intervention appears to be justified further back than table wine production, by encouraging the use of must for certain purposes other than wine-making by means of aid to ensure that Community wine products may maintain their traditional market outlets; the measure should be applied so as to avoid distortions of competition, taking into account traditional production methods; 
(43) producers who have not fulfilled their obligations under compulsory distillation measures should not be allowed to benefit from any other intervention measures; 
(44) provision should also be made for possible measures in the case of high prices on the Community market; 
(45) given the special features of the market in wine, the formation of producers' organisations is likely to contribute to the attainment of the objectives of the common organisation of the market; Member States may recognise such organisations; the latter must be formed on a voluntary basis and must prove their utility through the scope and efficiency of the services offered by producer organisations to their members; 
(46) in order to improve the operation of the market for quality wines psr and table wines with a geographical indication, Member States should be able to implement decisions taken by sectoral organisations; the scope of such decisions should exclude certain concerted practices; the Commission should ensure that such decisions conform with Community law; the sectoral organisations should perform certain tasks, taking into account consumers' interests; 
(47) for health reasons and in pursuit of quality, authorised oenological processes and practices should be laid down at Community level, these being the only ones permitted for use in the manufacture of products covered by this Regulation; for similar reasons, only wine grape varieties should be used to produce wines for human consumption; 
(48) in view of the fact that production conditions, in particular soil, terrain and climate, vary considerably from one Community wine-growing area to another, it is essential that such variations are taken into account with regard to oenological practices and processes; for reasons of simplicity and to facilitate the modifications based on experience and technological progress, certain technical limits and conditions connected with these practices and processes should be defined in the detailed rules of implementation; nevertheless, the limits concerning the levels of sulphur dioxide, sorbic acid and potassium sorbate should be laid down in this Regulation in view of their importance for health; 
(49) provision should be made for authorised methods of analysis for wine-sector products; 
(50) the description, designation and presentation of products covered by this Regulation can have significant effects on their marketability; this Regulation should therefore lay down rules in this connection which take into account the legitimate interests of consumers and producers and promote the smooth operation of the internal market and the production of quality products; the fundamental principles of these rules should provide for the obligatory use of certain terms so as to identify the product and provide consumers with certain important items of information and the optional use of other information on the basis of Community rules or subject to rules concerning the prevention of fraudulent practices; 
(51) the rules concerning in particular designation should include provisions on the prevention of fraudulent practices, penalties at Community level to be applied in the event of improper labelling, use of languages, in particular when different alphabets are involved, and the use of brand names, especially when these could cause confusion amongst consumers; 
(52) in view of the differences between products covered by this Regulation and their markets, and the expectations of consumers and traditional practices, the rules should be differentiated according to the products concerned, in particular as far as sparkling wine is concerned and according to their origin; 
(53) rules should also be applied to the labelling of imported products, in particular to clarify their origin and to avoid any confusion with Community products; 
(54) the right to use geographical indications and other traditional terms is a valuable one; the rules should therefore govern this right and provide for protection for these terms; to promote fair competition and so as not to mislead consumers, this protection may need to affect products not covered by this Regulation, including those not found in Annex I to the Treaty; 
(55) bearing in mind the interests of consumers and the desirability of obtaining equivalent treatment for quality wine psr in third countries, provisions should be made so that reciprocal arrangements can be established whereby wines imported for direct human consumption and bearing a geographical description and marketed in the Community may enjoy these protection and control arrangements; 
(56) in order to take account of the obligations arising, in particular, from Articles 23 and 24 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Righs, which forms an integral part of the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation approved by Decision 94/800/EC(48), provision should be made for the parties concerned to prevent, under certain conditions, the unlawful use of geographical designations protected by a third-country member of the WTO; 
(57) the development of a policy of encouraging quality production in agriculture and especially in wine growing is bound to contribute to the improvement of conditions on the market and, as result, to an increase in outlets; the adoption of additional common rules which concern the production and control of quality wines psr falls within the framework of this policy and can contribute towards the attainment of those objectives; 
(58) in order to maintain a minimum quality standard for quality wines psr, to avoid an uncontrollable expansion in the production of such wines, and to harmonise the provisions of the Member States so as to establish conditions of fair competition in the Community, a framework of Community rules should be adopted, governing the production and control of quality wines psr, with which the specific provisions adopted by the Member States will have to comply; 
(59) taking into account traditional conditions of production, the nature and scope of the factors which enable each of the quality wines psr to be distinguished must be listed and defined; a common move to harmonise quality requirements should nevertheless be made; these factors should be: the demarcation of the area of production, vine varieties, cultivation methods, wine-making methods, minimum natural alcoholic strength by volume, yield per hectare and analysis and assessment of organoleptic characteristics; particular rules should be laid down for quality liqueur wines psr and quality sparkling wines psr given the particular nature of those products; 
(60) experience has shown the need to draw up precise rules for reclassifying quality wines psr as table wines and to specify the cases in which the producer has the option of not requesting that a product appearing in his harvest or production declaration as a product suitable for yielding a quality wine psr be classified as a quality wine psr; 
(61) in order to preserve the particular quality characteristics of quality wines psr, Member States should be allowed to apply additional or more stringent rules governing the production and movement of quality wines psr, in accordance with fair and traditional practices; 
(62) the creation of a single Community market for wine involves the introduction of a single trading system at the external frontiers of the Community; a trading system including import duties and export refunds, in addition to the external market measures, should, in principle, stabilise the Community market; the trading system should be based on the undertakings accepted under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations; 
(63) in order to monitor the volume of trade in wine with third countries, provision should be made for a system of import and export licences for certain products, which includes the lodging of a security to guarantee that the transactions for which such licences are granted are effected; 
(64) in order to prevent or counteract adverse effects on the Community market which could result from imports of certain agricultural products, imports of one or more such products should be subject to payment of an additional import duty, if certain conditions are fulfilled; 
(65) it is appropriate, under certain conditions, to confer on the Commission the power to open and administer tariff quotas resulting from international agreements concluded in accordance with the Treaty or from other acts of the Council; 
(66) provisions for granting a refund on exports to third countries, based on the difference between prices within the Community and on the world market, and falling within the WTO Agreement on Agriculture(49), should serve to safeguard Community participation in international trade in wine; these refunds should be subject to limits in terms of quantity and value; 
(67) compliance with the value limits should, when refunds are fixed, be ensured through the monitoring of payments under the rules relating to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund; monitoring can be facilitated by the compulsory advance fixing of refunds, while allowing the possibility, in the case of differentiated refunds, of changing the specified destination within a geographical area to which a single refund rate applies; in the case of a change of destination, the refund applicable to the actual destination should be paid, with a ceiling on the amount applicable to the destination fixed in advance; 
(68) ensuring compliance with the quantity limits calls for the introduction of a reliable and effective system of monitoring; to that end, the granting of refunds should be made subject to an export licence; refunds should be granted up to the limits available, depending on the particular situation of each product concerned; exceptions to that rule should only be permitted in the case of food-aid operations, which are exempt from any limit; monitoring of the quantities exported with refunds during the marketing years as referred to in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture should be carried out on the basis of export licences issued for each marketing year; 
(69) in addition to the system described above, and to the extent necessary for its proper working, provision should be made for regulation or, when the situation on the market so requires, prohibiting the use of inward-processing arrangements; 
(70) the customs duty system makes it possible to dispense with all other protective measures at the external frontiers of the Community; however, the internal market and duty mechanism could, in exceptional circumstances, prove defective; in such cases, so as not to leave the Community market without defence against any disturbances which may arise therefrom, the Community should be able to take all necessary measures without delay; those measures should be in accordance with the obligations derived from the relevant WTO agreements; 
(71) products imported from third countries should be subject to rules on certain product specifications which ensure a measure of balance with Community definitions of wines; they should also comply with any rules laid down in their country of origin and be accompanied by an analysis report in appropriate circumstances; 
(72) it should be provided that all the products covered by this Regulation should be furnished with an accompanying document when circulating within the Community; 
(73) the establishment of a single market would be jeopardised by the granting of certain aids; the provisions of the Treaty which allow the assessment of aids granted by Member States and the prohibition of those which are incompatible with the common market should therefore apply in the common market organisation for wine; the provisions on premiums for the permanent abandonment of wine-growing should not of themselves preclude the granting of national aid for the same ends; 
(74) given the necessary complexity of the rules in the wine sector, Member States' authorities should be responsible for ensuring compliance; the Commission should itself be able to monitor and ensure such compliance through its own inspectors collaborating with Member States' authorities; 
(75) it is necessary that, as the common market in wine develops, the Member States and the Commission should keep each other supplied with the information necessary for applying this Regulation; producers of grapes for wine-making, must and wine should make a harvest declaration since this information is necessary; Member States should be able to request further information from producers; the Commission should be permitted to use external assistance when assessing any data; 
(76) in order to facilitate implementation of the proposed measures, a procedure should be provided for establishing close cooperation between Member States and the Commission within a management committee; 
(77) expenditure incurred by the Member States as a result of the obligations arising out of the application of this Regulation should be financed by the Community in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(50); 
(78) the common organisation of the market in wine should take appropriate account, at the same time, of the objectives set out in Articles 33 and 131 of the Treaty; 
(79) the common organisation of the market in wine should also be applied in the light of the agreements concluded under Article 300(2) of the Treaty, in particular those forming a part of the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation, notably that on technical barriers to trade;(51) 
(80) the change from the arrangements in Regulation (EC) No 822/87 and the other Regulations in the wine sector to those in this Regulation could give rise to difficulties which are not dealt with in this Regulation; in order to deal with that eventuality, provision should be made for the Commission to adopt the necessary transitional measures; the Commission should also be authorised to solve specific practical problems,

TITLE II 
PRODUCTION POTENTIAL 
CHAPTER I 
PLANTING OF VINES 
Article 2 
1. Planting with vines of wine grape varieties classified pursuant to Article 19(1) shall be prohibited until 31 July 2010 unless carried out pursuant to: 
(a) a new planting right, as referred to in Article 3; 
(b) a replanting right, as referred to in Article 4; or 
(c) a planting right granted from a reserve, as referred to in Article 5 or in Article 6(1) in the case of the application of Article 5(8). 
Until the same date, grafting of wine grape varieties on to varieties other than wine grape varieties shall also be prohibited. 
2. Grapes obtained from areas: 
(a) where vines have been planted before 1 September 1998, and 
(b) whose production, according to Articles 6(3) or 7(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, could only be disposed of by distillation, 
may not be used for producing wine which is to be marketed. Products made from such grapes may be put into circulation only for the purposes of distillation. However, these products may not be used in the preparation of alcohol having an actual alcoholic strength by volume of 80 % vol or less. 
3. Where a Member State has compiled the inventory of wine production potential in accordance with Article 16, it may derogate from paragraph 2 of this Article. Such a derogation shall be granted by 31 July 2002 and shall involve permission being granted for the areas concerned to produce wine which is to be marketed. 
The derogation shall be granted: 
(a) where the producer concerned had previously grubbed up other vines on an equivalent area in terms of pure crop except in cases where the grower concerned has received a premium for grubbing-up under Community or national legislation in respect of the area concerned; and/or 
(b) by permitting the use of replanting rights where a producer has obtained them within a period to be fixed subsequent to the planting of the area concerned; Member States may also use the newly created planting rights for this purpose under Article 6(1); and/or 
(c) where the Member State can prove (to the satisfaction of the Commission) that it has unclaimed replanting rights which would still be valid if they had been applied for; such rights may be used and reallocated to producers for an area equivalent in pure crop; and/or 
(d) where the producer concerned had undertaken to grub up an area equivalent in terms of pure crop, within a period of three years, where that area has been entered in the Vineyard Register of the Member State concerned. 
4. Where paragraph 3(a) or (c) is applied, Member States shall impose an appropriate administrative penalty on the producers concerned. 
5. Paragraph 3(c) may only be used in respect of an area no greater than the limit of 1,2 % of the area under vines. 
6. Where paragraph 3(b) is applied: 
(a) where the grower obtains the rights from a reserve, these may only be obtained under Article 5(3)(b) and he shall pay 150 % of the price normally charged by Member States under that provision, or 
(b) where the grower purchases a replanting right, this shall cover the area concerned, plus 50 %, which latter amount shall be transferred to the reserve or the reserves in accordance with Article 5 or added to the volume of newly created planting rights in Article 6(1) where Article 5(8) is applied. 
7. Areas planted with vines of wine grape varieties classified pursuant to Article 19(1): 
(a) planted from 1 September 1998 whose production according to Articles 6(3) or 7(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 could only be disposed of by distillation, or 
(b) planted in breach of the prohibition on plantings in paragraph 1, 
shall be grubbed up. The expenses of such grubbing up shall be borne by the producer concerned. Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that this paragraph is applied. 
Article 3 
1. Member States may grant new planting rights to producers in respect of areas: 
(a) intended for new planting carried out under measures for land consolidation or measures concerning compulsory purchases in the public interest adopted under national legislation, 
(b) intended for wine-growing experiments, or 
(c) intended for graft nurseries. 
Member States may also grant new planting rights in respect of areas whose wine or vine products are intended solely for the consumption of the vine grower's family. 
2. Member States may also grant new planting rights no later than 31 July 2003 for areas for the production of a quality wine prs or a table wine described by means of a geographical indication where it has been recognised that, owing to its quality, the production of the wine in question is far below demand. 
3. New planting rights shall be used by the producer to whom they were granted, in respect of the areas and for the purposes for which they were granted. 
4. New planting rights shall be used before the end of the second wine year after the one in which they were granted. New planting rights other than those referred to in paragraph 1 not so used during this period shall be allocated to a reserve in accordance with Article 5(2)(a). 
5. New planting rights other than those referred to in paragraph 1 may only be granted to producers within the quantities set out in Article 6(1). To this end: 
(a) prior to the allocation of the newly created planting rights referred to in Article 6 to a reserve or reserves, Member States shall ensure that the grant of new planting rights does not reduce the volume of the newly created planting rights in Article 6(1) to a value less than zero; and 
(b) once a Member State has allocated the newly created planting rights referred to in Article 6 to a reserve or reserves, the subsequent granting of a new planting right shall mean that a planting right corresponding to an equal area in terms of pure crop allocated to the reserve or reserves related to the region in question shall be extinguished. Should sufficient planting rights not be available in the reserve or reserves concerned, the grant of new planting rights may not take place. 
Article 4 
1. Replanting rights shall be: 
(a) replanting rights granted under paragraph 2; or 
(b) similar rights acquired under prior Community or national legislation. 
2. Member States shall grant replanting rights to producers who have grubbed up an area of vines. Member States may grant replanting rights to producers who untertake to grub up an area of vines, before the end of the third year after which the area was planted. The replanting rights shall be for an area equivalent in terms of pure crop to that from which vines have been or are to be grubbed up. 
3. Replanting rights shall be exercised on the holding in respect of which they were granted. Member States may further stipulate that such replanting rights may be exercised only on the area where the grubbing-up was carried out. 
4. By way of derogation from paragraph 3, replanting rights may be transferred, in whole or in part, to another holding in the same Member State where: 
(a) part of the holding concerned is transferred to that other holding. In this case, the right may be used on an area on the latter holding no greater than the area transferred; or 
(b) areas on that other holding are intended for: 
(i) the production of quality wines psr or table wines which are described by means of a geographical indication, or 
(ii) for the cultivation of graft nurseries. 
The rights may only be used in respect of the areas and for the purposes for which they were granted. 
Member States shall ensure that the application of these derogations shall not lead to an overall increase in production potential on their territory, in particular when transfers are made from non-irrigated to irrigated areas. 
5. Replanting rights acquired under this Regulation shall be used before the end of the fifth wine year after the end of the one during which the grubbing-up took place. By way of derogation, this period may be extended by Member States to up to eight wine years. Replanting rights not used during this period shall be allocated to a reserve pursuant to Article 5(2)(a). 
Article 5 
1. In order to improve the management of production potential, at a national and/or regional level, Member States shall create a national reserve, and/or as the case may be, regional reserves, of planting rights. 
2. The following shall be allocated to the reserve or reserves: 
(a) new planting rights, replanting rights and planting rights granted from the reserve which are not used within the time limits laid down respectively in Article 3(4), Article 4(5) and paragraph 6 of this Article; 
(b) replanting rights allocated to the reserve by producers who hold such rights, where necessary in return for a payment from national funds, the amount of which, and any other detail of which, shall be determined by the Member States taking into account the legitimate interests of the parties; 
(c) newly created planting rights, as referred to in Article 6. 
3. Member States may grant the rights allocated to the reserve: 
(a) without payment, to producers who are under 40 years of age, who possess adequate occupational skill and competence, who are setting up for the first time on a wine-producing holding and who are established as the head of the holding; or 
(b) against payment into national and, if appropriate, regional funds, to producers who intend to use the rights to plant vineyards whose production has an assured outlet. The Member States shall define the criteria for setting the amounts of the payment which may vary depending on the final intended product of the vineyards concerned. 
4. Member States shall ensure that the location where planting rights granted from a reserve are used, the varieties used and the cultivation techniques used guarantee that the subsequent production is adapted to market demand and that the yields concerned are typical of the average in the region where such rights are used, in particular, where planting rights originating in non-irrigated areas are used in irrigated areas. 
5. Planting rights allocated to a reserve may be granted from it no later than the end of the fifth wine year following the one during which they were allocated to it. Planting rights not granted by that time shall be extinguished. 
6. Planting rights granted from a reserve shall be used before the end of the second wine year after the one in which they were granted. Planting rights granted from a reserve not so used during this period shall be allocated to a reserve under paragraph 2(a). 
7. When a Member State creates regional reserves, it may lay down rules permitting the transfer of planting rights between regional reserves. If regional and national reserves coexist in the same Member State, transfers between such transfers may also be permitted. 
The transfers referred to in this paragraph may be subject to a reduction coefficient. 
8. By way of derogation fram paragraphs 1 to 7, a competent authority of a Member State may choose not to implement the reserve system provided that the Member State can prove that an effective system for managing planting rights exists throughout its territory. That system may, where necessary, derogate from the relevant provisions of this Chapter. Where a Member State has such a system, replanting rights as referred to in the first sentence of Article 4(5) shall be extended by five wine years. The second sentence of Article 4(5) shall remain applicable. 
Article 6

Article 24 
1. Aid shall be granted to producers for the private storage of: 
(a) table wine; 
(b) grape must, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must. 
2. The aid shall be granted subject to the conclusion with intervention agencies, between 16 December and 15 February of the following year and on conditions to be determined, of a long-term storage contract. 
3. Long-term storage contracts shall be concluded for a period which ends: 
(a) at the earliest, for table wines, on 1 September following the date of conclusion, and for grape musts, concentrated grape musts and rectified concentrated grape musts, on 1 August following the date of conclusion; 
(b) at the latest, on 30 November following the date of conclusion. 
Article 25 
1. The conclusion of storage contracts shall be subject to conditions relating in particular to the quality of the products in question.

2. Under the procedure laid down in Article 75, it may be provided: 
- that the private storage aid scheme shall not be applied if it is apparent from the market situation that the scheme is not justified, 
- that the possibility of concluding further long-term storage contracts may be suspended at any time if this is justified by the market situation and in particular the rate at which contracts have already been concluded. 
CHAPTER II 
DISTILLATION 
Article 27 
1. The overpressing of grapes, whether or not crushed, and the pressing of wine lees shall be prohibited. The refermentation of grape marc for purposes other than distillation shall be prohibited. 
2. Filtering and centrifuging of wine lees shall not be considered as pressing where:

8. Those subject to the obligations referred to in paragraph 3 or to that referred to in paragraph 6 may discharge that obligation by the withdrawal of the by-products of vinification under supervision and subject to conditions to be determined. 
9. The buying-in price of grape marc, wine lees and of wine delivered for distillation under this Article shall be EUR 0,995 per % vol/h. 
10. The price paid by the distiller may not be lower than the buying-in price. 
11. The distiller may either: 
(a) receive aid in respect of the product to be distilled, provided that the product obtained by distillation has an alcoholic strength of at least 52 % vol; or 
(b) deliver the product obtained by distillation to the intervention agency; provided that it has an alcoholic strength of at least 92 % vol. 
If wine has been processed into wine fortified for distillation before delivery to the distiller, the aid referred to in (a) shall be paid to the manufacturer of the fortified wine and the product of the distillation may not be delivered to the intervention agency. 
12. It may be decided that delivery of the alcohol to the intervention agency may be replaced by delivery to an operator who has submitted a tender in the framework of sales organised for the disposal of the products of distillation which has been accepted under the procedure referred to in Article 31(1). 
13. Paragraphs 1 to 12 shall not apply to grape juice or concentrated grape juice or grape must or concentrated grape must intended for the preparation of grape juice. 
Article 28 
1. Where wine is produced from a grape variety listed in the classification for the same administrative unit as both a wine grape variety and a variety for use for another purpose, any wine which is produced in excess of the normal quantity and which is not exported during the wine year concerned shall be distilled by a date to be determined. Except by derogation, it may not be moved except to a distillery. 
2. The quantity of wine normally produced shall be determined from:

4. The price paid by the distiller may not be lower than the buying-in price. 
5. The distiller may either: 
(a) receive aid in respect of the product to be distilled, provided that the product obtained by distillation has an alcoholic strength of at least 52 % vol; or 
(b) deliver the product obtained by distillation to the intervention agency, provided that it has an alcoholic strength of at least 92 % vol. 
If wine has been processed into wine fortified for distillation before delivery to the distiller, the aid referred to in (a) shall be paid to the manufacturer of the fortified wine and the product of the distillation may not be delivered to the intervention agency. 
6. It may be decided that delivery of the alcohol to the intervention agency may be replaced by delivery to an operator who has submitted a tender in the framework of sales organised for the disposal of the products of distillation which has been accepted under the procedure referred to in Article 31(1). 
7. This Article shall apply notwithstanding Article 1(2). 
Article 29 
1. The Community may provide support for the distillation of table wines and wines suitable for yielding table wines in order to support the wine market and, as a consequence, facilitate the continuation of supplies of wine distillate to those parts of the potable alcohol sector, where the use of such alcohol is traditional. 
2. The support shall take the form of a primary aid and a secondary aid paid to distillers. 
3. The primary aid shall be paid on the basis of the volume of table wine and wine suitable for yielding table wine which is destilled. 
4. The primary aid shall be implemented on the basis of a system of contracts concluded between distillers and wine producers. A minimum price to be paid by distillers to wine producers shall be determined; it may vary during a given wine year provided that the average for that wine year remains at least EUR 2,488 per % vol. 
5. The level of primary aid shall reflect: 
(a) the need for the average minimum price to be paid by distillers to wine producers in a given wine year to respect the level referred to in paragraph 4; 
(b) the need to maintain supplies to traditional outlets in the potable alcohol sector at competitive prices. 
6. The secondary aid shall take the form of a payment to cover reasonable storage costs of the resultant product. It shall serve to facilitate the operation of the primary aid system. 
Article 30 
1. There may be a crisis distillation measure if there is an exceptional case of market disturbance caused by serious surpluses and/or problems of quality. 
2. The measure shall have as its objectives:the elimination of specific pockets of surplus; 
(a) the elimination of specific pockets of surplus; 
(b) the assurance of supply continuity from one harvest to another. 
3. The measure shall be voluntary on the part of producers. 
4. The measure may be limited to certain categories of wine or certain areas of production. The measure may be applied to quality wine psr only at the request of the Member State concerned. 
5. A criterion for introducing the measure may be a demonstrable deterioration, over time, in the market price for a category of wine or for wines from certain areas of production. 
6. Should the Community use this measure for three years in succession, for a particular type of wine (in a particular area), the Commission shall draw up a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the persistent crisis including, if appropriate, proposals. 
Article 31 
1. Alcohol taken over by the intervention agency shall be disposed of either by public auction or by a tendering process. When disposing of such alcohol, as far as possible, the authorities shall avoid affecting the market outlets for alcohol traditionally dependent on the existence of such outlets. It may not be disposed of into the sector of alcohol destined for comestible use. 
2. However, it may be decided that if the supply of the part of that sector where the use of wine alcohol is compulsory is not assured by means of the operation of Articles 27, 28 and 29, such alcohol may be disposed of into that sector. 
Article 32 
1. For the wines made by producers who have increased the alcoholic strength by adding sucrose or must having benefited from the aid referred to in Article 34, the buying-in price fixed for each distillation, with the exception of that referred to in Article 27, shall be reduced within each wine-growing area by a similar flat-rate amount calculated on the basis of the level of the aid referred to in Article 34 and the increase in the alcoholic strength prescribed for the wine-growing area concerned. 
2. At the request of the producer concerned, the reduction shall apply only within the limits of the quantities subject to the increased alcoholic strength referred to in paragraph 1. 
Article 33 
1. Detailed rules for the application of this Chapter shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 75. 
These rules may in particular include: 
(a) the derogations referred to in this Chapter; 
(b) in respect of Articles 27 and 28, the conditions under which distillation is to be carried out, the assessment of the volume of alcohol contained in the wine produced, the conditions under which products may be delivered to the intervention agency, and the buying-in prices of the products of distillation which can be taken over by the intervention agencies or the criteria for fixing these prices;

CHAPTER III 
AIDS FOR SPECIFIC USES 
Article 34 
1. Aid is hereby established for the use of: 
(a) concentrated grape musts; 
(b) rectified concentrated grape musts, 
produced in the Community, when they are used in order to increase alcoholic strengths of the wine products for which such increases are authorised within the meaning of this Regulation. 
2. The grant of aid may be reserved for products coming from wine-growing zone C III if the trade patterns in must and coupage wines cannot be guaranteed without this measure. 
3. The amount of aid shall be fixed in euro per % vol potential alcoholic strength and per hectolitre of concentrated grape must or rectified concentrated grape must, taking into account the difference between the cost of enrichment by means of these products and by means of sucrose. 
Article 35 
1. Aid is hereby established for the use of: 
(a) grape musts and concentrated grape musts produced within the Community for the purpose of manufacturing grape juice or manufacturing other comestible products from such grape juice; 
(b) grape musts and concentrated grape musts produced in zone C III for the purpose of manufacturing, in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, products falling within CN code 2206 00 in respect of which, pursuant to Annex VII, paragraph 2 of point C, the use of a composite name including the word %quot%wine%quot% may be allowed by these Member States; 
(c) concentrated grape musts produced within the Community as the main element in a set of products marketed in the United Kingdom and Ireland with clear instructions for the consumer to obtain from it a beverage in imitation of wine (home-made wine). 
2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1(b), where the geographical restriction related to the production of grape musts and concentrated grape musts referred to in that point gives rise to distortion of competition, it may be decided to extend the granting of the aid to grape musts and concentrated grape musts produced in regions of the Community other than zone C III: 
3. The aids referred to in paragraph 1 shall be reserved for the use of products coming from vine varieties which are classified exclusively as wine grapes or as both a wine grape variety and variety for use for another purpose and may equally be granted to grapes of Community origin coming from the same varieties. 
4. The amounts of aid must be fixed so that the supply costs for grape musts and concentrated grape musts originating in the Community are such that they may maintain their traditional market outlets. 
5. A part to be determined of the aid provided for in paragraph 1(a) shall be set aside for the organisation of campaigns to promote the consumption of grape juice. The aid may, for the purposes of organising such campaigns, be fixed at a higher level than that resulting from the application of paragraph 4. 
Article 36 
Detailed rules for the application of this Chapter shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 75. 
These rules shall in particular include: 
(a) the conditions for granting the aid referred to in Article 34(1); 
(b) the measures necessary to ensure control of the use of the products referred to in Article 35(1); 
(c) the amount of the aid referred to in Articles 34 and 35, which shall be fixed before the start of each wine year;

Article 52 
1. If a Member State uses the name of a specified region to designate a quality wine psr or, where appropriate, a wine intended for processing into such a quality wine psr, that name may not be used to designate products of the wine sector not produced in that region and/or products not designated by the name in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Community and national rules. This shall also apply if a Member State has used the name of a local administrative area or part thereof or a small locality solely to designate a quality wine psr or, where appropriate, a wine intended for processing into such a quality wine psr. 
Without prejudice to the Community provisions concerning specific types of quality wine psr, Member States may, in the case of certain conditions of production which they shall determine, authorise the name of a specified region to be accompanied by details relating to the method of manufacture or the type or by the name of a vine variety or a synonym thereof. 
Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission may decide, until 31 August 2001, to allow certain geographical names traditionally used to designate a table wine and which have become the name of a given region to continue to be used also to designate table wines for a maximum of three wine years. 
2. The following names and terms: 
- the name of a vine variety, 
- a traditional specific term referred to in the fourth sub-indent, second indent, of point A 2(c) of Annex VII, or in the second indent of point D 2(c) of Annex VIII, or

may be used for the description, presentation and advertising of a beverage other than a wine or grape must only if there is no risk of confusion as to the nature, origin or source and composition of such beverage. 
3. The use of a name or a term as referred to in point 2 or of the words %quot%Hock%quot%, %quot%Claret%quot%, %quot%Liebfrauenmilch%quot% and %quot%Liebfraumilch%quot%,even when accompanied by a word such as %quot%kind%quot%, %quot%type%quot%, %quot%style%quot%, %quot%imitation%quot% or other similar expression, shall be prohibited with respect to the description and presentation of: 
- an item covered by CN code 2206, except where the item in question actually comes from the place so designated, 
- an item marketed with clear instructions for the consumer to obtain from it a beverage in imitation of wine (home-made wine); however, the name of a vine variety may be used if the item in question is actually obtained from such variety unless that name gives rise to confusion with the name of a specific region or geographically unit used to describe a quality wine psr. 
4. The names: 
- of a given region, 
- of a geographical unit smaller than the given region, provided that that name has been attributed by a Member State for the description of a wine by virtue of Community provisions, 
may only be used for the description, presentation or advertising of a beverage other than wine or grape must on condition: 
(a) in respect of products covered by CN codes 2009, 2202, 2205, 2206, 2207, 2208 and 2209, and in respect of products made from a raw material for producing wine, that the above names and terms are recognised in the Member State of origin of the product and that that recognition complies with Community law; 
(b) in respect of beverages other than those referred to in point (a), that there is no risk of confusion as to the nature, origin or source and composition of such bevarage.

2. The trigger prices below which an additional import duty may be imposed shall be those forwarded by the Community to the World Trade Organisation. 
The trigger volumes which must be exceeded for an additional import duty to be imposed shall be determined in particular on the basis of Community imports over the three years preceding the year in which the adverse effects referred to in paragraph 1 have occured or are likely to occur. 
3. The import prices to be taken into account for the imposition of an additional import duty shall be determined on the basis of the cif import prices of the shipment concerned.

(c) a method based on taking traditional trade patterns into account (using the %quot%traditional importers/new arrivals%quot% method). 
Other appropriate methods may be adopted. They shall avoid any discrimination between the operators concerned. 
3. The method of administration adopted shall, where appropriate, give due weight to the supply requirements of the Community market and the need to safeguard the equilibrium of that market, while at the same time possibly drawing on the methods which have been applied in the past to quotas corresponding to those referred to in paragraph 1, without prejudice to the rights resulting from agreements concluded as part of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. 
4. The detailed rules referred to in paragraph 1 shall provide for annual quotas, if necessary, suitably phased in over the year and shall determine the administrative method to be used and, where appropriate, shall include:

2. For the allocation of the quantities which may be exported with refunds, the method shall be established which: 
(a) is the best suited to the nature of the product and to the situation on the market in question, enabling the most efficient use possible to be made of the available resources, and having regard to the efficiency and structure of Community exports without, however, creating discrimination between large and small operators; 
(b) is the least cumbersome administratively for operators, having regard to management imperatives; 
(c) precludes discrimination between the operators concerned.

ANNEX VI 
QUALITY WINE PSR 
A. Specified regions 
1. %quot%Specified region%quot% shall mean a wine-growing area or a combination of wine-growing areas which produces wines with particular quality characteristics and whose name is used to designate quality wines psr. 
2. Each specified region shall be precisely demarcated, as far as possible on the basis of the individual vineyardyard or vineyardyard plot. Such demarcation shall be effected by each Member State concerned and shall take into account the factors which contribute towards the quality of the wines produced in those regions, such as the nature of the soil and subsoil, the climate and the situation of the individual vineyardyard or vineyard plot. 
3. The specified region is designated by its geographical name. 
However, the appellations: 
- %quot%Muscadet%quot%, 
- %quot%Blanquette%quot%, 
- %quot%Vinho Verde%quot%, 
- %quot%Cava%quot%, applied to certain quality sparkling wines psr, 
- %quot%Manzanilla%quot% 
are recognised as the names of the respective specified regions demarcated and regulated by the relevant Member States before 1 March 1986. 
As regards still wines, the word %quot%Κάβα%quot% and/or %quot%Cava%quot% may be used to designate Greek table wines, as information relating to the ageing of such wines. 
4. The geographical name designating a specified region must be sufficiently precise and familiarly linked to the area of production so that, taking account of the existing situations, confusion may be avoided. 
B. Vine Varieties 
1. Each Member State shall draw up a list of the vine varieties, referred to in Article 19, suitable for producing each of the quality wines psr produced in its territory. These varieties must be of the species Vitis vinifera. 
2. Vine varieties which do not appear on the list referred to in paragraph 1 shall be removed from the vineyards or vineyard plots intended for the production of quality wine psr. 
3. However, notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, the presence of a vine variety which does not appear on the list may be permitted by Member States for a period of three years from the date on which the demarcation of a specified region comes into effect, where the said demarcation was made after 31 December 1979, provided that such vine variety belongs to the species Vitis vinifera and that it does not represent more than 20 % of the vine varieties on the vineyard or vineyard plot involved. 
4. At the latest by the end of the period laid down in paragraph 3, any vineyard or vineyard plot intended for the production of quality wines psr may consist only of vine varieties appearing on the list provided for in paragraph 1. Where this provision is not observed, none of the wines obtained from grapes harvested within the vineyard or vineyard plot shall be entitled to the designation %quot%quality wine psr%quot%. 
C. Wine-growing methods 
1. Each Member State shall lay down the provisions regarding wine-growing methods which are required in order to ensure the best possible quality for quality wines psr. 
2. Irrigation within a wine-growing zone may be carried out only to the extent that the Member State concerned has authorised it. Such authorisation may be granted only where ecological conditions justify it. 
D. Processing areas 
1. Quality wines psr may be produced only: 
(a) from grapes of wine varieties which appear on the list provided for in paragraph 1 of point B and are harvested within the specified region; 
(b) by processing grapes as referred to in subparagraph (a) into grape must and processing the must thus obtained into wine or sparkling wine, as well as by the production of such wine, within the specified region where the grapes used were harvested. 
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1(a), in the case of a traditional practice governed by special provisions of the Member State of production, that Member State may until 31 August 2003 at the latest, by means of express authorisations and subject to suitable controls, permit that a quality sparkling wine psr be obtained by adding to the basic product from which the wine is made one or more wine-sector products which do not originate in the specified region whose name the wine bears, provided that: 
- the type of added wine-sector product is not produced in that specified region with the same characteristics as products not originating therein, 
- the adjustment is consistent with the oenological practices and definitions referred to in the relevant Community provisions, 
- the total volume of added wine-sector products which do not originate in the specified region does not exceed 10 % of the total volume of products used which originate in the specified region. However the Commission may, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 75, authorise the Member State to allow in exceptional cases a percentage of added products higher than 10 %, but not more than 15 %. 
The exception referred to in the first subparagraph shall be applicable provided that such an arrangement was allowed for by the provisions of the producer Member State concerned before 31 December 1995. 
Member States shall draw up a list of the names of the quality sparkling wines psr referred to in this paragraph and shall forward it to the Commission, which shall publish it in the %quot%C%quot% series of the Official Journal of the European Communities. 
3. Notwithstanding paragraph 1(b), a quality wine psr, other than a quality sparkling wine psr, may be produced in an area in immediate proximity to the specified region concerned, where this has been expressly authorised by the Member State concerned subject to certain conditions. 
Moreover, Member States may, by means of individual authorisations subject to appropriate control, permit a quality wine psr to be produced by processing grapes into must and must into wine, as well as by producing such wine, even outside an area in immediate proximity to the specified region concerned, in the case of a traditional practice, provided this practice: 
- was in use before 1 September 1970 or, in the case of Member States which acceded to the Community after that date, before the effective date of their accession; 
- has continued without interruption since those dates; and 
- involves quantities which, for the processor in question, have not increased since by more than those corresponding to the general market trend. 
4. Notwithstanding paragraph 1(b), a quality sparkling wine psr may be produced in an area in immediate proximity to the specified region concerned, where this has been expressly authorised by the Member State concerned subject to certain conditions. 
Moreover, Member States may, by means of individual authorisations or express authorisations lasting for less than five years subject to appropriate control, permit a quality sparkling wine psr to be produced, even outside an area in immediate proximity to the specified region concerned in the case of a traditional practice, provided this practice was in use before 24 November 1974, or, in the case of Member States which acceded to the Community after that date, before the effective date of their accession. 
5. Any natural or legal person or group of persons which has grapes or musts which satisfy the conditions laid down for obtaining quality wines psr on the one hand and other products not satisfying these conditions on the other hand, shall ensure a separate wine-making process and storage for the former; otherwise, the wine obtained cannot be considered as quality wine psr. 
6. The provisions of this point D, other than paragraph 5, shall not apply to quality liqueur wines psr.

or 
- are obtained by alcoholic fermentation of a fruit or of another agricultural raw material, in particular the products referred to in paragraph 2 of point C of Annex VII and the products covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91, laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of aromatised wines, wine-based drinks and aromatised wine-product cocktails(1), 
or 
- have an actual alcoholic strength by volume not greater than 1,2 % vol., 
- products which are not likely, despite the fact that they are put up in this way, to create confusion or mislead consumers with regard to the real nature of the product. 
3. Insofar as labelling is not governed by this Regulation it may be governed by implementing provisions, in particular as regards: 
(a) the positioning of labels in containers; 
(b) the minimum size of labels; 
(c) the arrangement on labels of the various items comprising the description; 
(d) the size of the characters on labels; 
(e) the use of symbols, illustrations and brand names.

5. Where containers containing a product referred to in paragraph 1 of point A are presented for sale to the final consumer in a package, it must be labelled in accordance with this Regulation. 
Arrangements for avoiding excessive strictness in the case of special packaging containing small quantities of the products referred to in paragraph 1 of point A, on their own or with other products, shall be adopted. 
H. Brand names 
1. Where the description, presentation and advertising of the products referred to in paragraph 1 of point A are supplemented by brand names, such brand names may not contain any words, syllables, signs or illustrations which: 
(a) are likely to cause confusion or mislead the persons to whom they are addressed within the meaning of Article 48; 
or 
(b) are liable to be confused with all or part of the description of a table wine, a quality wine produced in a specified region, including a quality sparkling wine psr or an imported wine whose description is governed by Community provisions or with the description of any other product referred to in paragraph 1 of point A, or are identical to the description of any such product, unless the products used for constituting the cuvée of the sparkling wine in question are entitled to such description or presentation. 
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1(b), the holder of a well-known registered brand name for a product referred to in paragraph 1 of point A, which contains wording that is identical to the name of a specified region or the name of a geographical unit smaller than a specified region may, even if he is not entitled to use such a name pursuant to paragraph 1, continue to use that brand name where it corresponds to the identity of its original holder or of the original provider of the name, provided that the brand name was registered at least 25 years before the official recognition of the geographical name in question by the producer Member State in accordance with Article 54(4) as regards quality wines psr and that the brand name has actually been used without interruption. 
Brand names complying with the conditions of the first subparagraph may not be invoked against the use of the name of geographical units used to describe a quality wine psr. 
I. General provisions 
1. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of point F, each Member State shall accept the description and presentation of products referred to in paragraph 1 of point A which originate in other Member States and are put on the market in its territory, provided that such description and presentation conform to Community rules and are allowed pursuant to this Regulation in the Member State in which the product was produced. 
2. The description, presentation and advertising of products other than those covered by paragraph 1 of point A may not indicate, imply or suggest that the product concerned is a sparkling wine. 
3. The sales descriptions set out in paragraph 2 of point D shall be used only for the products referred to in paragraph 1 of point A. 
However, Member States may allow the term %quot%sparkling wine%quot% to be used in the form of a composite name to describe a beverage falling within CN code 2206 00 91 obtained by alcoholic fermentation of a fruit or another agricultural raw material where use of those composite names is traditional, pursuant to legislation in force on 29 November 1985. 
4. The composite names referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3 shall be indicated on the labelling in characters of the same type and colour and of a height which enables them to stand out clearly from other information. 
5. Quality sparkling wines psr may be put on the market only on condition that the name of the specified region to which they are entitled is marked on the cork and that the bottle carries a label from the time it leaves the place of preparation. 
However, as regards labelling, exceptions may be permitted provided that appropriate controls are ensured. 
6. Provisions for the implementation of paragraph 5 shall be adopted, as well as derogations concerning marking on the cork referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 5, where, on the occasion of a check by the competent authority, a sparkling wine is not recognised as a quality sparkling wine psr.
