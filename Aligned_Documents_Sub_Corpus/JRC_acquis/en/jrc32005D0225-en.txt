(notified under document number C(2005) 600) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2005/225/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market [1], and in particular Article 10(4) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In response to outbreaks of classical swine fever in certain Member States, Commission Decision 2003/526/EC of 18 July 2003 concerning protection measures relating to classical swine fever in Belgium, France, Germany and Luxembourg [2] was adopted. That Decision establishes certain additional disease control measures concerning classical swine fever. 
(2) The classical swine fever situation in certain areas of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany, in the department of Moselle in France and in Luxembourg has significantly improved. This is also the case in the territories of the District Veterinary and Food Administrations of Levice, Nitra, Topoľčany, Nové Mesto nad Váhom and the district Púchov in Slovakia. Therefore, the measures adopted by Decision 2003/526/EC in relation with these areas should no longer apply. 
(3) In the light of the overall disease situation of classical swine fever in other areas of Germany, France and Slovakia, it is appropriate to extend the validity of Decision 2003/526/EC. 
(4) Decision 2003/526/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
