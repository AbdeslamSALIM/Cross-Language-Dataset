THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 538/96 (2), and in particular Articles 3 (3) and 5 in conjunction with Article 25 (4) thereof, 
Whereas Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 lays down that the textile products referred to in Annex V originating in the countries indicated therein may be imported into the Community provided an annual quantitative limit is established in accordance with the appropriate procedure provided for in Article 25; 
Whereas the Commission has received requests from three Member States with a view to introducing quantitative import limits for products falling within categories 87 (gloves, mittens and mitts, not knitted or crocheted) and 109 (tarpaulins, sails, awnings and sunblinds) originating in North Korea (listed in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 517/94) in order to satisfy certain market requirements; whereas, following deliberations within the committee set up under Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 517/94, it was considered appropriate, in particular in the light of the situation of the Community industry concerned, to set annual quantitative limits for imports into the Community of products falling within categories 87 and 109 originating in North Korea of 5 tonnes and 10 tonnes respectively, which will be applicable from the date of entry into force of this Regulation; whereas Annexes IV and V to Regulation (EC) No 517/94 should be amended accordingly; whereas the quotas in question shall be managed, in the interests of legal security; in accordance with Article 17 of that Regulation; 
Whereas these measures are in accordance with the opinion of the committee set up by Regulation (EC) No 517/94,
