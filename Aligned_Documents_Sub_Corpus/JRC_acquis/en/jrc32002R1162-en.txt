THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 of 24 June 1991 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 473/2002(2), and in particular Article 11(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The list of third countries from which certain agricultural products obtained by the organic production method must originate in order to be marketed within the Community, provided for in Article 11(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, is set out in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 94/92(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2589/2001(4). That list was drawn up in accordance with Article 11(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. 
(2) New Zealand submitted to the Commission a request to be included in the list provided for in Article 11(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. Its authorities submitted the information required pursuant to Article 2(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 94/92. 
(3) The examination of this information and consequent discussion with the authorities of New Zealand has led to the conclusion that in that country the rules governing production and inspection of agricultural products are equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. 
(4) Imports from New Zealand to the European Community take place currently according to Article 11(6) of (EEC) Regulation No 2092/91. Producers and exporters will need a transitional period in order to adapt themselves to the Food Official Organic Assurance Programme. 
(5) The duration of New Zealand's inclusion in the list should be subject to the outcome of the on-the-spot check of the rules of production and the inspection measures actually applied in New Zealand, provided for in Article 11(5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. 
(6) New Zealand authorities have provided the Commission with all the necessary guarantees and information which satisfy the requirement that the inspection bodies meet the criteria laid down in Article 11(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. 
(7) Regulation (EEC) No 94/92 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee mentioned in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,
