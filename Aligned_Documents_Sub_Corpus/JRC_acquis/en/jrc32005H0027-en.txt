THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 211 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Under Articles 3(2)(d) and 4(1)(d) of Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC [1], the Member States are to ensure that unleaded petrol and diesel fuel of a fixed maximum sulphur content are available within their territories on an appropriately balanced geographical basis. 
(2) Directive 98/70/EC also provides that the Commission is to develop guidance for recommending what constitutes, for those purposes, availability of 10 mg/kg sulphur unleaded petrol on an appropriately balanced geographical basis. 
(3) It seems appropriate to develop this type of guidance also for diesel fuel with a maximum sulphur content of 10 mg/kg. 
(4) The Commission has assessed several options. As a result of that work, and after consultation with Member States, experts from the industrial and commercial sectors concerned, and other non-governmental organisations, the Commission has developed such guidance,
