THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,

Whereas: 
(1) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 94/2002(2) provides for the drawing up of lists of themes and products for which information and/or promotion measures may be carried out. 
(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 1907/1990 of 26 June 1990 on certain marketing standards for eggs(3) requires, inter alia, that eggs for human consumption be marked with a code indicating the producer and allowing identification of the type of farming, as from 1 January 2004. 
(3) It would be useful to inform consumers about these new rules on the marking of eggs. 
(4) Eggs for human consumption should therefore be included in the list of products which may be covered by information and/or promotion measures, and general guidelines should be defined for the campaigns to be carried out in this sector. 
(5) Taking account of the date for drawing up these guidelines, it will not be possible to comply with the dates set for transmitting and approving the first series of programmes presented in 2004 for eggs intended for human consumption. In view of the need to inform consumers as soon as possible, a special deadline should be set for transmitting and approving that first series. 
(6) Regulation (EC) No 94/2002 should be amended accordingly. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion delivered at the joint meeting of the management committees on agricultural product promotion,
