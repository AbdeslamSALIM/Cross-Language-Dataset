AGREEMENT 
concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION 
and 
THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND AND 
THE KINGDOM OF NORWAY, 
WHEREAS since the signature of the Agreement of Luxembourg of 19 December 1996 between the thirteen Member States of the European Union, signatories to the Schengen agreements and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, the latter two States have been participating in the discussions concerning the application, implementation and further development of the Schengen agreements and related provisions; 
WHEREAS as a result of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community by the Treaty of Amsterdam amending the Treaty on European Union, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related Acts (hereinafter referred to as %quot%the Schengen Protocol%quot%), the cooperation among the Member States of the European Union signatories to the Schengen agreements within the scope of those agreements and related provisions will be conducted within the institutional and legal framework of the European Union and with respect for the relevant provisions of the Treaty on European Union and of the Treaty establishing the European Community; 
RECALLING the object and purpose of the Agreement of Luxembourg to preserve the existing regime between the five Nordic States pursuant to the Convention on the Abolition of Passport Controls at Intra-Nordic borders signed in Copenhagen on 12 July 1957, establishing the Nordic Passport Union, once those of the Nordic States which are Members of the European Union take part in the regime on the abolition of checks on persons at internal borders set out in the Schengen agreements; 
BEARING IN MIND the provisions laid down in the Agreement of Luxembourg; 
RECOGNISING, however, that the integration of the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union implies that the taking of decisions purporting to further develop the provisions constituting the Schengen acquis has become a matter for the European Union, including the European Community; 
WHEREAS according to Article 6, first paragraph, of the Schengen Protocol, the European Union, including the European Community, wishes to respect and serve the object and purpose of the Agreement of Luxembourg through an Agreement associating the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, upon the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, with the implementation of the Schengen acquis and its further development on the basis of the Agreement of Luxembourg, thus ensuring the common objective of continuing the involvement of these two States in these activities; 
CONVINCED of the need to involve all parties in an appropriate fashion which are applying the provisions constituting the Schengen acquis and to which such provisions and their further development may eventually have to apply, including the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, in discussions, at all levels, concerning their practical application, their implementation and the preparation of their further development; 
CONSIDERING that for this purpose it is necessary to set up an organisational structure, outside the institutional framework of the European Union, ensuring the association of the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway with the decision-making process in these fields and enabling their participation in these activities through a Mixed Committee, 
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS: 
Article 1

FINAL ACT 
The Contracting Parties have adopted this Final Act, containing the following declarations: 
1. Declaration by Iceland and Norway on Article 4(2) 
Regarding meetings of the Mixed Committee at ministerial level, Iceland and Norway consider that it is up to them to assess whether a particular issue is to be regarded as %quot%problems they encounter%quot% (first indent of the provision) or %quot%concern to them%quot% (second indent of the provision), and is of a nature requiring discussions at ministerial level. It is, in accordance with the common interest of the Parties, foreseen that such %quot%problems%quot% and %quot%concerns%quot% will normally surface in the course of the regular cooperation in a manner which will lead to their inclusion on the agenda of the Mixed Committee at ministerial level. Nevertheless, Iceland and Norway emphasise the right of the members of the Mixed Commitee to request meetings of the Mixed Committee at any level in accordance with Article 3(3) of the Agreement.

2. Declarations made pursuant to Article 6(1) of the European Covention on Extradition, opened for signature in Paris on 13 December 1957, shall not be invoked as grounds for refusing to extradite residents from non-Nordic States to Member States of the European Union which ensure equal treatment. 
4. Joint declaration on Parliamentary consultation

AGREEMENT IN THE FORM OF EXCHANGES OF LETTERS 
between the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning committees which assist the European Commission in the exercise of its executive powers 
A. Letter from the Community 
Sir, 
The Council refers to the negotiations concerning the Agreement concerning the association of the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway to the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis and has taken good note of the request of Iceland and Norway, in the spirit of their participation in the decision-making process in the fields covered by the Agreement and in order to enhance the good functioning of the Agreement, to be fully associated with the work of the committees which assist the European Commission in the exercise of its executive powers. 
The Council notes that in future, when such procedures will be applied in the fields covered by the Agreement, there will indeed be a need to associate Iceland and Norway with the work of these committees, also in order to ensure that the procedures of the Agreement have been applied to the acts or measures concerned, so that these may become binding on Iceland and Norway. 
Therefore, the European Community is ready to commit itself to negotiate, as soon as the need arises, appropriate arrangements for the association of Iceland and Norway with the work of these committees. 
I should be obliged if you would inform me of whether or not your Government is in agreement with the above. 
Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.

STATEMENTS 
1. Statement of the Council, adopted by the unanimity of its Members referred to in Article 6(1) of the Schengen Protocol 
%quot%It is the understanding of the Council that decisions to be taken by the Mixed Committee pursuant to the Arrangement shall be taken unanimously by the representatives of the Members of the Council referred to in Article 6(1) of the Schengen Protocol and by the representatives of the governments of Iceland and Norway, unless the Rules of Procedure or the Agreement to be concluded under Article 6(2) of the Schengen Protocol provide otherwise.%quot% 
2. Statement by the Council and the Commission in respect of Directive 95/46/EC 
%quot%Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31) has not been included in Annex B to the Agreement with the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, in view of the proposal of the Commission of 2 December 1998 for the Decision of the Joint Committee of the EEA to include that Directive in Annex XI to the EEA Agreement(1). 
The European Union is of the view that this Directive constitutes an integral part of the Schengen acquis insofar as it has replaced provisions of the 1990 Schengen Convention pursuant to Article 134 of that Convention. 
If the Directive were not included in Annex XI of the EEA Agreement, the Union assumes that the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway will take the necessary steps to ensure that they will apply its provisions. 
This statement will be published together with the text of the aforementioned Agreement with the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway in the Official Journal of the European Communities.%quot% 
3. Statement entered in the Council minutes at the time of the adoption of the negotiating directives 
%quot%The Council agrees that any matter concerning the implementation of the Agreement with Iceland and Norway is to be placed on the agenda for the Mixed Committee in timely fashion. Before the Mixed Committee meets, the Presidency will, if it so considers necessary or at the request of any delegation or of the Commission, call a meeting of the competent Council body in order to ascertain whether any particular matter does not need to be referred to the Mixed Committee or whether any particular other matter would be better first discussed or resolved within the Union (for example, visa questions or other questions to which the association procedure provided for in Article 6 of the Schengen Protocol does not strictly apply). 
Re point I on the list(2): neither proposals being negotiated within the Union nor the adaptation or development of acts based on the Treaty on European Union on the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty may be referred to the Mixed Committee before a reasonabletime has elapsed. 
The fact that certain matters are not dealt with under the procedure laid down in the Agreement to be concluded on the basis of the first paragraph of Article 6 of the Schengen Protocol does not, of course, rule out the possibility of reguarly informing our Icelandic and Norwegian partners of developments within the Union in relation to such matters.%quot% 
4. Declaration of the negotiating delegations made at the time of the initialling of the Agreement 
%quot%The negotiating delegations take note of Declaration 47 of the Intergovernmental Conference on the occasion of the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam. 
They agree that it would be desirable that the Contracting Parties to the Agreement take the necessary preparatory steps so as to allow the entry into force of the Agreement on the same day as the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam.%quot% 
5. Declaration of the negotiating delegations from the Presidency of the Council, the Commission and Norway 
%quot%The negotiating delegations from the Presidency of the Council, the Commission and from Norway share the understanding that the question as to the cases in which provisional application would be possible under Norwegian law does not affect the application of paragraph 4 of Article 8 of the Agreement.%quot%
