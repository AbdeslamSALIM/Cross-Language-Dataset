concerning the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Ukraine on trade in certain steel products 
(2004/895/EC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133, in conjunction with Article 300(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, and Ukraine [1], entered into force on 1 March 1998. 
(2) Article 22(1) of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement provides that trade in certain steel products shall be governed by Title III, save for Article 14 thereof, and by the provisions of an Agreement.

It is therefore appropriate to replace these as far as 2004 is concerned with a further agreement which takes account of developments in the relationship between the Parties.
