(2005/76/EC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 in conjunction with Article 300(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) Under the terms of the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of The Comoros on fishing off The Comoros [1], the Contracting Parties are to enter into negotiations, before the period of validity of the Protocol to the Agreement expires, to determine by mutual agreement the contents of the Protocol for the period that follows and, where applicable, the amendments or additions to be made to the Annex thereto. 
(2) The two Contracting Parties have decided that, pending negotiations on amendments to the Protocol, the period of validity of the current Protocol approved by Regulation (EC) No 1439/2001 [2] should be extended from 28 February 2004 to 31 December 2004 by means of an agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters. 
(3) The exchange of letters provides Community fishermen with fishing opportunities from 28 February 2004 to 31 December 2004 in waters over which The Comoros has sovereignty or jurisdiction. 
(4) To avoid any interruption in the fishing activities of Community vessels it is essential that the extension should enter into force as soon as possible. The Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters should therefore be signed, subject to its definitive conclusion by the Council. 
(5) The method of allocating the fishing opportunities among Member States on the basis of the extended Protocol should be confirmed, 
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
