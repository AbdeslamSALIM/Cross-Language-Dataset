Alternatively, recipients may ask for a grant of up to EUR 100000 for a period of three years, in strict compliance with the Community rules on de minimis aid laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 69/2001 of 12 January 2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to de minimis aid. 
In disadvantaged areas referred to in the Decree of the Minister of Labour and Social Security of 14 March 1995, as amended, where these are not already included in the Italian regional aid map or Objective 1 or 2 areas, transitional or otherwise, aid will be granted in accordance with the de minimis rule or, alternatively, in accordance with Article 4(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 70/2001. 
Aid is granted on condition that the investment is maintained in the region for at least five years from the time the activity is started. The scheme also provides for monitoring to ensure that this condition is complied with. If recipients fail to comply, the procedure for cancellation and repayment of any aid already disbursed will be started immediately. 
The recipient's contribution must be at least 25 % of the funding obtained. 
Aid under the various measures of the scheme cannot be combined for the same eligible costs. Nor can the aid be combined with aid under any other scheme for any purpose for the same eligible costs. For the purposes of the ceilings applicable, the overall amount of aid comprises all the aid received from any scheme and for any purpose, irrespective of the source (Community, national and regional or at any rate public). The responsible authority will monitor the scheme to ensure compliance with the rules on cumulation of aid. 
Date of implementation: The aid available under this scheme may be granted as from the date of entry into force of the Regulation laying down the rules for the grant of incentives to promote entrepreneurship. 
Duration of scheme: The scheme will end on 31 December 2006. 
(a) to encourage the creation and development of entrepreneurship, also in the form of cooperatives; 
(b) to facilitate access to credit for firms run by or mostly owned by young people; 
(c) to promote firms run by or mostly owned by young people in the most innovative branches of the various productive sectors; 
(d) to encourage the creation and development of the "social economy firm"; 
(e) to facilitate access to credit for social economy firms referred to in Article 1(1)(b) of Law No 381 of 8 November 1991. 
The measures concern small firms, as defined in the Commission Recommendation of 3 April 1996 (OJ L 107, 30.4.1996) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 of 12 January 2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid to small and medium-sized enterprises. 
Only in the case of existing social cooperatives, referred to in Article 35(3) of the draft regulation, may the measures also concern medium-sized firms, as defined in Commission Recommendation No 96/280/EC of 3 April 1996 and in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 of 12 January 2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid to small and medium-sized enterprises. In this case the ceilings laid down in Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 for medium-sized firms will apply. 
Applications for aid must be submitted before the planned investment is begun. 
- the production of goods in the craft or industrial sector or relating to the provision of services to firms in any sector; 
- the provision of services in the following sectors: exploitation of cultural assets, tourism, maintenance of civil and industrial structures, technology innovation, environmental protection, agriculture and the processing and marketing of agro-industrial products. 
The provision of services in the agricultural and agro-industrial sector falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 since it constitutes the supply of services (e.g. quality certification, technical consultancy) to private and public clients (consortia, mountain communities, entrepreneurs, etc.) rather than activities falling within the scope of the Community guidelines for State aid in the agriculture sector. 
Means of transport and transport equipment are excluded from the eligible investment costs for projects relating to the provision of services falling principally within the transport sector. 
The aid does not apply to the steel, shipbuilding, synthetic fibre or motor vehicle sectors. 
The measures do not provide in any way for export aid or aid contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods.
