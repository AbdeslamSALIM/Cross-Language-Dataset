Pleas in law and main arguments 
Applicant for a Community trade mark: Anheuser-Busch Incorporated 
Community trade mark concerned: Word mark %quot%BUD%quot% for goods in Classes 32 and 33 — Application No 1603539 
Proprietor of the mark or sign cited in the opposition proceedings: The applicant 
Mark or sign cited in opposition: Protected designation of origin %quot%BUD%quot% to designate beer 
Decision of the Opposition Division: Rejection of the opposition 
Decision of the Board of Appeal: Dismissal of the appeal 
Pleas in law: Infringement of Article 62(1) of Regulation No 40/94 [1] and Article 20 of implementing Regulation No 2868/95 [2] in that the Board of Appeal is not competent to rule on the validity of the designation of origin invoked by the applicant in the context of its opposition. It also submits that the sign %quot%BUD%quot% constitutes a designation of origin, protected in both France and Austria. The applicant moreover invokes misapplication of Article 8(4) of Regulation No 40/94 in that, in its view, the designation of origin %quot%BUD%quot% is indeed a sign used in the course of trade.
