Council Regulation (EC) No 941/2006 
of 1 June 2006 
amending Regulation (EC) No 51/2006, as concerns blue whiting and herring 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy [1], and in particular Article 20 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 51/2006 [2] fixes for 2006 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required. 
(2) Pursuant to consultations between the Community and the Faeroe Islands on 23 February 2006 an arrangement on mutual access on blue whiting stock and the herring stock in each other's, fishing zones has been reached. This arrangement should be implemented. 
(3) Since vessels that targeted hake with gill-nets in ICES Divisions VIa, b and VIIb, c, j, k and subarea XII were not implicated in the fishing practices that led to the prohibition of the use of gill-nets in those areas, it is appropriate to allow these fisheries to continue by way of derogation from the prohibition. 
(4) The Community has held consultations with Norway on the management of fisheries on the stock of Norwegian spring spawning (Atlanto-Scandian) herring in the North-East Atlantic, in particular, with regard to licensing arrangements, which should be implemented. 
(5) Regulation (EC) No 51/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Annexes IA, IB and IV to Regulation (EC) No 51/2006 shall be amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation. 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
