THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and imports from third countries of poultry and hatching eggs(1), as last amended by Directive 1999/90/EC(2), and in particular Articles 23, 24(2), 26 and 27a thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Specified pathogen free (SPF) eggs are hatching eggs, which are used for diagnostic procedures in laboratories, for the production and testing of vaccines and for research and pharmaceutical purposes and have to be marked with a stamp. 
(2) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2782/75 of 29 October 1975 on the production and marketing of eggs for hatching and of farmyard poultry chicks(3) lays down the requirements for marking of hatching eggs and its implementing Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1868/77(4), lays down detailed rules of application in particular concerning marking of hatching eggs. 
(3) SPF eggs are not fit for human consumption. 
(4) SPF eggs are not speficically definied as such in Community legislation therefore a specific definition has to be laid down. 
(5) The SPF eggs have to be produced in accordance with the valid European Pharmacopoeia(5), in which the requirements are defined. 
(6) These particular characteristics should prevent the introduction of avian influenza, Newcastle disease and other relevant poultry diseases into the Community on condition that all the other provisions of this Decision are applied. 
(7) Member States wish to import SPF eggs from countries, which are not considered as free from Newcastle disease and avian influenzua, but can offer satisfactory animal health guarantees for this specific product. 
(8) SPF eggs may only be used in facilities, where they have to be destroyed or otherwise treated after use in such a way that any risk of spread of disease is prevented. 
(9) An animal health certificate for this category of eggs and a corresponding list of non-member countries, which are allowed to use this certificate for the exportation of such eggs to the Community has to be drawn up. 
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,
