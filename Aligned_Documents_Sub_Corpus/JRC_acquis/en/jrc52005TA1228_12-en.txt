The Foundation's replies 
INTRODUCTION 
1. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (hereinafter referred to as "the Foundation") was set up by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75 of 26 May 1975 [1]. Its aim is to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions in the European Union by increasing and disseminating knowledge which is relevant to this subject. Table 1 summarises the Foundation's competences and activities on the basis of information it has supplied. 
2. For information, the annual accounts drawn up by the Agency for the financial year 2004 are summarised in Tables 2, 3 and 4. 
THE COURT'S OPINION 
3. The Court's opinion is addressed to the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with Article 185(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 [2]; it was drawn up following an examination of the Foundation's accounts, as required by Article 248 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. 
4. The Foundation's accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2004 [3] were drawn up by its Executive Director, pursuant to Article 16 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75, and sent to the Court, which is required to give its opinion on their reliability and on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. 
5. The Court conducted an audit in accordance with its policies and standards, which are based on international auditing standards that have been adapted to the Community context. The audit was planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance that the accounts are reliable and the underlying transactions are legal and regular. 
6. The Court has obtained a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed below. 
Reliability of the accounts 
The Foundation's accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2004 are, in all material respects, reliable. 
Legality and regularity of the underlying transactions 
The transactions underlying the Foundation's annual accounts, taken as a whole, are legal and regular. 
The observations which follow do not call the Court's opinion into question. 
OBSERVATIONS 
7. Analysis of the appropriations carried over to the 2005 financial year shows that 37 % of the commitments carried over were entered into in December 2004. The majority relate to contracts for studies to be carried out in 2005. This practice demonstrates a lack of consistency between the Foundation's annual work programme, on the one hand, and the budget estimates, on the other. 
8. The physical inventory was not exhaustive as no inventory was made of IT equipment. No organisation manual and no annual verification programme have yet been established [4]. 
9. The revenue and expenditure account for the financial year 2003 shows a loss of 1,3 million euro. This amount should have been recorded in an amending budget for the financial year 2004 [5]. 
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg at its meeting of 5 October 2005.

THE FOUNDATION'S REPLIES 
7. Due to unforeseen circumstances, a significant surplus became available in some budget lines and was utilised in December to commence work on research activities relevant for 2004 and 2005. Moreover in order to increase the synergy between Foundation activities, it was decided to use a single tender in 2005 for all services for observatories. As a consequence some of the relevant existing contracts had to be extended in December to bridge the time between the conclusion of those contracts and that foreseen for commencement of a new 2005 contract. 
8. Procedures have now changed to provide for registration in the inventory on the basis of Delivery Dockets. 
The updating of the financial procedures manual is scheduled for completion in September 2005 and will incorporate an annual programme for verification of inventory items. 
9. The 1,3 million euro represents sums due for payment by the Commission to the Foundation. The Commission was contacted during 2004 with regard to establishing an amending budget and has indicated it will examine the issue in 2005.
