COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1399/1999 
of 29 April 1999 
amending Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 51 and 235 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), presented after consulting the Administrative Commission on Social Security for Migrant Workers, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3), 
(1) Whereas it is appropriate to make certain amendments to Council Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community(4) and (EEC) No 574/72 of 21 March 1972 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community(5); whereas these amendments are linked to changes which Member States have made to their social security legislation; 
(2) Whereas the application of Chapter 8 to orphans' pensions raises problems of interpretation and administration, and it is in the interests of the persons concerned for orphans' pensions to be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3 of Title III, rather than on the basis of the provisions of Chapter 8; 
(3) Whereas the calculation of orphans' pensions in accordance with Chapter 3 does not affect the obligation to pay the differential payments in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice for those benefits which remain in Chapter 8; 
(4) Whereas it seems appropriate to amend section %quot%L. PORTUGAL%quot% of Annex IIa in order to take into account the changes made to Portuguese legislation; 
(5) Whereas a new point should be added to section %quot%G. IRELAND%quot% and another to section %quot%O. UNITED KINGDOM%quot% of Annex VI in order to take into account the specific rules of priority in the event of cumulation of entitlement to family allowances under United Kingdom and Irish legislation through the exercising of a professional activity in the territory of one of those two Member States; 
(6) Whereas the provisions contained in the Annexes to Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 have no direct influence on the determination of the rights of individuals; 
(7) Whereas it should be possible for all the Annexes to Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 to be amended by a Regulation adopted by the Commission at the request of the Member State or Member States concerned or their competent authorities, after the opinion of the Administrative Commission has been obtained; whereas in actual fact the purpose of amending these Annexes is simply to incorporate into a Community instrument decisions taken by the Member States concerned or their competent authorities; 
(8) Whereas it is necessary to amend section %quot%43. SPAIN - ITALY%quot% of Annex 5 to Regulation (EEC) No 574/72; 
(9) Whereas, as a result of the administration reorganisation in France concerning the examination of applications for the extension of postings or special postings, section %quot%E. FRANCE%quot% of Annex 10 to Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 should be amended accordingly; 
(10) Whereas, in order to attain the objective of free movement for workers in the field of social security, it is necessary and appropriate to amend the rules relating to the coordination of national social security schemes through a Community legal instrument that is binding and directly applicable in each Member State; 
(11) Whereas this is consistent with the provisions of the third paragraph of Article 3b of the Treaty, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
