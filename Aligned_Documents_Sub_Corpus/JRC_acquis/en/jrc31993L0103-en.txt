10.2. Doors and in particular sliding doors, where such have to be used, must function as safely as possible for the workers, especially in adverse weather and sea conditions. 
11. Traffic routes - danger areas 
11.1. Passageways, trunks, the outer part of deckhouses and all traffic routes in general must be equipped with guard rails, grab rails and lifelines or other means of ensuring the safety of workers in the course of activities on board. 
11.2. If there is a risk that workers may fall through openings in the deck, or from one deck to another, adequate protection should be provided wherever possible. 
11.3. Access to installations above the deck for operation or maintenance purposes must be such as to ensure workers' safety. 
Guard rails or similar protective devices of appropriate height must be provided to prevent falls. 
11.4. Bulwarks or other means provided to prevent persons falling overboard must be maintained in an efficient condition. 
Bulwarks must be fitted with freeing ports or other similar devices to enable water to drain away quickly. 
11.5. On stern trawlers with ramps, the ramp must be fitted with a gate or other means of securing it of the same height as the bulwarks or other adjacent means, to protect workers from the risk of falling into the ramp. 
This gate or other device must be easily opened and closed and must be open only for casting the net or for hauling it in. 
12. Layout of workstations 
12.1. Working areas must be kept clear and, as far as possible, be protected from the sea and provide adequate protection for workers against falling on the vessel or falling overboard. 
Handling areas must be sufficiently spacious, in terms of both height and surface area. 
12.2. If the engines are controlled from the engine room, they must be controlled from a separate area, soundproofed and insulated from the engine room per se and accessible without passing through the latter. 
The navigating bridge is considered to be an area that meets the requirements of the first subparagraph. 
12.3. The controls for the hauling gear must be installed in an area sufficiently large to enable operators to work unhindered. 
The hauling gear must also have appropriate safety devices for emergencies, including emergency stop facilities. 
12.4. The hauling gear operator must have an adequate view of the hauling gear and the workers at work. 
If the hauling gear is controlled from the bridge, the operator should also have a clear view of the workers at work, either directly or via any other suitable medium. 
12.5. A reliable communications system must be used between the bridge and the working deck. 
12.6. A sharp look out should always be maintained and the crew warned of the imminent danger of heavy oncoming seas during fishing operations or when other work is being done on deck. 
12.7. Contact with bare ropes and warps and with moving parts of the equipment must be minimized by installing protective devices. 
12.8. Controls must be installed for moving masses, particularly on trawlers: 
- devices to immobilize the otter boards, 
- devices to control the swinging motion of the codend. 
13. Living quarters 
13.1. The workers' living quarters, where they exist, must be such as to minimize noise, vibration, the effects of motion and acceleration, and unpleasant odours from other parts of the vessel. 
Appropriate lighting must be installed in the living quarters. 
13.2. The galley and mess, where they exist, should be of adequate size, adequately lit and ventilated and easy to clean. 
Refrigerators or other low-temperature food-storage equipment must be provided. 
14. Sanitary facilities

On all vessels first-aid equipment must be available which fulfils the requirements in Annex II to Directive 92/29/EEC. 
16. Accommodation ladders and gangways 
An accommodation ladder, gangway or other similar equipment providing an appropriate, safe means of boarding the vessel must be available. 
ANNEX III 
MINIMUM SAFETY AND HEALTH REQUIREMENTS FOR CONCERNING LIFE-SAVING AND SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT (Articles 7 (1) (d)) Preliminary note 
The obligations laid down in this Annex apply wherever required by the features of the workplace, the activity, the circumstances or a risk on board a vessel. 
1. Vessels must carry adequate life-saving and survival equipment, including adequate means of recovering workers from the water, and radio rescue, in particular an emergency position-indicating radio beacon with a hydrostatic release mechanism, taking account of the number of persons on board and the area in which the vessel is operating. 
2. All items of life-saving and survival equipment must be kept in their proper locations, maintained in good working order and be available for immediate use. 
They must be checked by the workers before the vessel leaves port and during the voyage. 
3. The life-saving and survival equipment must be inspected at regular intervals. 
4. All workers must receive proper training and appropriate instructions in anticipation of an emergency. 
5. If the length of the vessel exceeds 45 metres or if five or more workers are carried, a muster list must be provided with clear instructions for each worker which must be followed in case of emergency. 
6. Musters of workers for survival drill should be carried out each month in port and/or at sea. 
These drills must ensure that the workers thoroughly understand and are exercised in the duties which they have to perform with respect to the handling and operation of all life-saving and survival equipment. 
Workers must be trained in the setting up and operation of the portable radio equipment, where carried. 
ANNEX IV 
MINIMUM SAFETY AND HEALTH REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (Articles 7 (1) (e)) Preliminary note 
The obligations laid down in this Annex apply whenever required by the features of the workplace, the activity, the circumstances or a risk on board a vessel. 
1. Where risks to the safety and health of workers cannot be prevented or sufficiently limited by collective or technical means of protection, they must be provided with personal protective equipment. 
2. Personal protective equipment in the form of clothing or worn over clothing must be in bright colours, contrasting with the marine environment and clearly visible.
