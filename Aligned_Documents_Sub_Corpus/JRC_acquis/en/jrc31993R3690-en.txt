COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 3690/93 of 20 December 1993 establishing a Community system laying down rules for the minimum information to be contained in fishing licences 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1) , 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2) , 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee, 
Whereas, in order to help improve the regulation of exploitation and its transparency, Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 of 20 December 1992 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture(3) provides for the introduction of a general Community system of fishing licences; 
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy(4) provides inter alia for rules concerning the monitoring of conservation and resources management measures; whereas this framework should be supplemented; 
Whereas the Community system should set out the rules concerning the minimum information to be contained in the fishing licences for each fishing vessel flying the flag of a Member State; 
Whereas it is therefore necessary to provide for fishing licences to show information on the identification characteristics and technical characteristics of fishing vessels; 
Whereas the information contained in fishing licences should satisfy the characteristics laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 of 22 September 1986 defining characteristics for fishing vessels(5) and comply with the detailed rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1381/87 of 20 May 1987 establishing detailed rules concerning the marking and documentation of fishing vessels(6) ; whereas this information should correspond to the information furnished in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 163/89 of 24 January 1989 concerning the fishing vessel register of the Community(7) ; 
Whereas provision should be made for the Member States to adopt measures making it possible for the competent authorities to check, at any time, information contained in the fishing licences; 
Whereas provisions should be laid down to enable cooperation within the Community; 
Whereas it is desirable that these should be either a temporary period for issuing fishing licences in the form of documents, or an exemption from the obligation to hold licences on board for certain categories of vessel,
