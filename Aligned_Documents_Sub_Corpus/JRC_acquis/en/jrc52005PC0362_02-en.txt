Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 
on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals {SEC(2005) 1047} 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
amending Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL 
( Grounds for and objectives of the proposal 
The purpose of this proposal is to update, recast and consolidate the animal health rules in relation to the trade in aquaculture products, including disease prevention and control, in order to improve the competitiveness of EU aquaculture producers. 
Aquaculture is a very important industry in the Community, particularly in rural and coastal areas. In 2004, EU aquaculture produced fish, molluscs and crustaceans worth more than €2,5 billion. However, financial losses due to disease (mortalities, reduced growth and reduced quality) are estimated to be 20 % of the production value. The proposal aims to introduce modern and targeted legislation that reduces these costs; if they could be reduced by only 20%, the result would be an added value of €100 million per year. 
The existing legislation was developed two decades ago when the EU had only 12 Member States. It was primarily designed to protect the main EU aquaculture at that time, namely salmonid (trout and salmon) and oyster farming. The legislation now needs to be updated to reflect the broader range of aquaculture practises and species that are found in the expanded EU, and to take account of the significant developments within the industry, the experience gained through 15 years of application of the existing legislation, as well as scientific advances in this field. The rules must also be updated to bring EU rules in line with international agreements and standards (like WTO/SPS and OIE). 
This proposal corresponds to the Commission legislative Working Programme project 2004/SANCO/0025 
( General context 
This proposal will repeal the existing primary legislation (Council Directives 91/67/EEC, 93/53/EEC and 95/70/EC) and replace those three Directives with one new Directive. This much needed revision and consolidation will update the legislation to reflect the EU aquaculture industry in the 21st century, and simplify and modernise existing rules to provide more flexibility, and delegate more operational responsibility to Member States so that, for example, effective local or regional approaches can be taken to prevent and contain diseases. 
( Existing provisions in the area covered by the proposal 
This proposal will replace 
- Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products; 
- Council Directive 93/53/EEC of 24 June 1993 introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases; 
- Council Directive 95/70/EC of 22 December 1995 introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain diseases affecting bivalve molluscs. 
The general principles laid down in the three Directives in question will be maintained. 
In addition, there are 13 implementing Decisions which have been adopted pursuant to those Directives. The implementing Decisions will remain in force until they are repealed by a specific Decision, or replaced by a Decision adopted pursuant to this proposal. 
( Consistency with other policies 
The aquaculture industry falls under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The main interaction between this proposal and the legislation related to the CFP concerns the financial support (see also Com (2004) 497 - final). It is proposed that the same principle applied for terrestrial animal diseases, namely that a financial contributions from the Community should be made available where Community law requires a slaughter/eradication policy to be carried out, should also be applied to aquatic animal diseases. 
The proposal upholds the principle laid down in existing legislation that the animal health provisions shall apply without prejudice to national or international provisions on the conservation of species or the introduction of non-native species. More stringent rules may therefore be applied where this is necessary for the protection of species from an environmental or conservation point of view. The proposal would therefore not conflict with Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora. Furthermore, major change in policy to concentrate more on, - allowing Member States to allocate more resources to - disease prevention, should reduce the environmental impact of the aquaculture industry by reducing outbreaks of disease. 
Public health concerns are not dealt with in this proposal, as it is regulated by the "hygiene package". None of the diseases or pathogens covered by this proposal is known to have zoonotic potential. 
The welfare of farmed fish falls within the scope of the existing general provisions of Community legislation concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. Scientific advice from the European Food Safety Authority, in addition to Council of Europe recommendations concerning the welfare of fish (within the scope of the European Convention for the protection of animals kept for farming purposes) will influence future policy initiatives in this area. 
The present animal health provisions relating to third countries will in principle remain unchanged. 
2. CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
( Consultation of interested parties 
Consultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents. 
Written consultations took place in 2000 and 2001 via the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture (ACFA). In this Committee the following organisations are represented: Federation of European Aquaculture Producers (FEAP), European Mollusc Producers Association (EMPA/AEPM), Comité des Organisations Professionnelles Agricoles de l'UE (COPA/COGECA), Organisation of the workers unions (ETF), NGO for consumer and NGO for environment. The Commission’s services have regularly reported on developments in the project in the ACFA Working Group 2 (Aquaculture). 
Bilateral meetings have been held with FEAP and EMPA/AEPM during 2003, 2004 and 2005. 
Stakeholder consultations were held in September and December 2004. There have been several technical working group meetings with representatives from the Member States and EFTA/EEA states. 
Summary of responses and how they have been taken into account. 
The main comments from the Member States and stakeholders have been taken into account in the framing of the proposal. 
For the stakeholders, it is essential that the Directive contains a mechanism that will enable farms to maintain and, where possible improve, their health status, and also to encourage farms to make their health status known as a means of facilitating safe trade. An appropriate categorisation of health status will be the only way to prevent a degradation of the aquatic animal health status in the Community. The concept of categorisation has been introduced in the proposal. 
The aquaculture industry's need for economic compensation for disease eradication and control measures is also of importance to stakeholders, and is acknowledged by the Commission and the Member States. This acknowledgement is further discussed in a proposal for a Council Regulation - European Fisheries Fund (COM(2004) 497). 
Where the requests from the stakeholders have not been taken into account, it has been due to the international commitments of the Community or due to the need for cross-compliance with other Community legislation, in particular the WTO/SPS agreement and the EU Food Law. 
( Collection and use of expertise 
Scientific/expertise domains concerned. 
Aquatic animal health. 
Methodology used. 
The opinions have been considered in the draft proposal 
Main organisations/experts consulted. 
The scientific platform for the proposal was established by a working group of experts on aquatic animal health from EU and EFTA/EEA Member States. In addition experts from the industry were consulted. 
Level of scientific certainty: high. 
Advice received and used. 
Yes 
Means used to make the expert advice publicly available. 
Advice from expert working group meetings and stakeholder consultation meetings has not been made publicly available. However, the advice has been discussed with competent authorities and stakeholders in meetings. 
( Impact assessment 
The main provisions for placing on the market an import remains largely unchanged. However, some existing trade barriers have been removed without jeopardising the health status of aquaculture animals. The general disease control provisions will remain unchanged, with some minor adjustments. All diseases considered exotic to the Community will be subject to eradication provisions in order to maintain the Community’s free status. Under the present legislation such measures are applied for fish disease but not for mollusc diseases. The importation provisions are harmonised with the relevant provisions of Council Directive 2002/99/EC (the most recent Directive laying down animal health import provisions). 
Positive impacts 
Positive impacts will arise from an updated Community legislative framework which takes into account current scientific knowledge and the structure of today's aquaculture industry in the Community. 
There will be positive shift in focus away from preventing the spread disease and towards the occurrence of disease. Significant resources are now being used to maintain disease-free status in farms and zones that have been declared disease-free. The proposal would allow the Member State to re-allocate some of these resources to disease preventive activities. 
The proposal implements the philosophy that the best solution is often found closest to the problem, and delegates more operational responsibility to the Member States. 
By introducing general risk-based animal health surveillance, a better overview of the disease situation can be achieved. At the same time the risk of spreading diseases to farms or areas where the disease has not yet been found is reduced. 
The proposal takes into account the potential for exchange of disease agents between farmed and wild aquatic animals. 
The new legislation will be consistent with the International Aquatic Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and will reduce existing trade barriers between third countries, including developing countries, and the Community. 
Negative impacts 
The negative impact will be limited, as the proposal will to a large extent be founded on the existing legislation. Some new elements and requirements will have an administrative and economic impact on the Member States and on the industry. 
The proposal for authorisation of aquaculture production business will cause extra work for the competent authorities in the Member States. However, since all mollusc farms and the majority of fish farms are already registered, the authorisation requirement is achievable for the Member States. 
The introduction of a general risk-based animal health surveillance in all farms or farming areas, is an extension of the requirements in the present mollusc legislation, under which all Member States must have a monitoring and sampling program. 
3. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL 
( Summary of the proposed action 
The proposal includes 
- General requirements directed towards the aquaculture production business and processing establishments, such as authorisations, and provisions related to their operation; 
- Animal health provisions for placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products thereof; 
- Animal health provisions for introduction of aquaculture animals into the Community from third countries; 
- Provisions for notification and control of certain diseases in aquatic animal; 
- Provisions for declaration of disease-free status; 
- Requirements directed towards the competent authorities of the Member States, and laboratories; 
- Technical requirements and guidelines laid down in Annexes. 
( Legal basis 
Article 37 of the Treaty 
( Subsidiarity principle 
The proposal falls within the exclusive competence of the Community. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. 
( Proportionality principle 
The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). 
For the sake of the completion of the internal market, the animal health provisions applicable to the placing on the market of aquaculture animals should be fully harmonised. 
Some of the diseases subject to harmonised trade provisions are widespread in parts of the Community. It is however not realistic to enforce the same level of control measures in Member States that are free of these diseases, as in Member States where these diseases are widespread. 
The introduction of the principle of compartmentalisation will allow for more flexibility. 
The administrative and economic burden imposed will result in a higher health status, reduction of losses due to diseases and more open trade. Increased financial burden on the Community budget will be limited to the financial contribution in relation to the control and eradication of diseases which are subject to compulsory eradication measures. 
( Choice of instruments 
Proposed instruments: Directive. 
Other means would not be adequate for the following reason(s). 
Experience since 1964 with harmonised veterinary legislation in the Community, and in particular since 1991 with specific aquatic animal health legislation, have shown that a Directive gives sufficient flexibility for the Member States to apply Community veterinary legislation in the framework of national legislation and administration. 
4. BUDGET IMPLICATIONS 
The economic impact on Community budget is expected to be limited, and will mainly be in two areas: 
(a) Economic compensation in relation to disease control. 
The proposal should not affect the future development of the Community policy on animal health and the veterinary fund. 
Council Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field already allows for financial support in relation to outbreaks of Infectious Haematopoietic Necrosis (IHN) and Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA), under Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 solely. 
It is proposed that financial contribution for aquatic animal disease control from the Community should be eligible through the European Fisheries Fund (Article 32 of COM (2004) 497). 
In the proposal, compulsory slaughter/eradication will only be required under Community rules in relation to outbreaks of diseases that are considered exotic to the Community. With respect to non-exotic diseases it is proposed that the Member States may decide whether an outbreak should be subject to eradication measures or containment measures. Community funding under European Fisheries Fund may be made available for control measures of such diseases if the Member State so decides. 
If an exotic disease did occur in the Community, it would have no financial impact on Community budget. The same would occur in case of compensation for eradication of non-exotic diseases, since the allocation of funds for the eradication are made within the Operational Programmes, whose budget is fixed by the Council at the beginning of the programming period. 
In the interest of Member States, it would be convenient to assess the financial impact of eradication on their Operational Programmes. However, the costs related to such eradication measures are difficult to estimate, as there is limited experience in the Community of stamping out policy involving economic compensation in aquaculture. In the court case following the outbreaks of ISA in the UK and Ireland, one company owning five of the thirteen infected farms claimed total losses in the region of € 20-25 million. Sweden paid out compensation under national legislation totalling of 1,5 mill SEK (€165 000) over a period of three years in relation to four cases of VHS in 1998. 
It is therefore difficult to estimate the impact of the proposal on the European Fisheries Fund, as this will depend on the size of the farm(s) affected, the value of the animals kept at the farm(s), etc. However, the figures above can give an indication. 
(b) Implementation of primary legislation and adoption and management of secondary legislation 
Once the Council has adopted the proposal, it will be necessary to draw up, adopt and maintain secondary legislation. It will be necessary to arrange a number of working group meetings with Member States and stakeholders, the latter normally without any additional cost for the Community budget. The number of working groups is impossible to determine, as this will depend on the complexity of the items, and the views of the Member States. 
After the act’s entry into force, FVO inspections of Member States' implementation will be necessary in 2008 and 2009 (13 or 14 inspections per year). Such inspections should as far as possible be combined with public health inspections for "fishery products" and "live bivalve mollusc" pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004. It should be possible to reduce the number of missions in subsequent years. 
5. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
( Simplification 
The proposal provides for simplification of legislation, simplification of administrative procedures for public authorities (EU or national). 
Three directives will be merged into one. 
Most of the current provisions in Council Directive 93/53/ECC on the control of fish diseases are duplicated in Council Directive 95/70/EC on the control of mollusc diseases. 
Delegating the power to declare individual compartments and zones free of disease to the Member States will lead to a simplification of administrative procedures in the Member States and in the Commission services. 
( Repeal of existing legislation 
The adoption of the proposal will lead to the repeal of the three existing Directives. 
( European Economic Area 
The proposed act is of EEA relevance and should therefore be extended to the EEA. 
2005/0153 (CNS) 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 
on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals (Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament[2], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[3], 
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[4], 
Whereas: 
1. Aquaculture animals and products are included in Annex I to the Treaty as live animals, fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The breeding, rearing and the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products thereof constitutes an important source of income for persons working in this sector. 
2. In the context of the internal market, specific animal health rules were laid down for the placing on the market and introduction from third countries of the products concerned by Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products[5]. 
3. Outbreaks of diseases in aquaculture animals could cause severe losses to the industry concerned. Minimum measures to be applied in case of outbreaks of the most important diseases in fish and molluscs were established by Council Directive 93/53/EEC of 24 June 1993 introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases[6], and Council Directive 95/70/EC of 22 December 1995 introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain diseases affecting bivalve molluscs[7]. 
4. Existing Community legislation was drafted mainly to take into account the farming of salmon, trout and oysters. Since that legislation was adopted, the Community aquaculture industry has developed significantly. A number of additional fish species, particularly marine species, are now used in aquaculture. New types of farming practices involving other fish species have also become increasingly common, particularly following the recent enlargement of the Community. Furthermore, farming of crustaceans, mussels, clams and abalones is becoming increasingly important. 
5. All disease control measures have an economic impact on aquaculture. Inadequate controls can lead to a spread of pathogens, which can cause major losses and compromise the animal health status of fish, molluscs and crustaceans used in Community aquaculture. On the other hand, over-regulation could place unnecessary restrictions on free trade. 
6. The Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament dated 19 September 2002 (COM/2002/0511 final) sets out a strategy for the sustainable development of European Aquaculture. That Communication proposed a series of measures designed to create long-term employment in the aquaculture sector, including promoting high animal health and welfare standards, and environmental actions to ensure a sound industry. Those measures should be taken into account. 
7. Since the adoption of Directive 91/67/EEC, the Community has ratified the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS-Agreement). The SPS Agreement refers to the Guidelines of the World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE). The animal health requirements for placing live aquaculture animals and products thereof on the market within the Community in Directive 91/67/EEC are more stringent than those Guidelines. 
8. In order to ensure the rational development of this sector and to increase productivity, aquatic animal health rules should be laid down at Community level. These rules are necessary, among other things, in order to contribute to the completion of the internal market and to avoid the spread of infectious diseases. Legislation should be flexible to take into account the continuing developments in and diversity of the aquaculture sector, as well as the health status of aquatic animals within the Community. 
9. This Directive should cover aquaculture animals, and those environments which can affect the health status of such animals. In general the provisions of this Directive should only apply to wild aquatic animals where the environmental situation may impinge on the health status of aquaculture animals, or where necessary in order to fulfil the purpose of other Community legislation, such as Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora[8] or to protect species referred to in the list draw up by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This Directive should not prejudice the adoption of more stringent rules on the introduction of non-native species. 
10. The competent authorities designated for the purpose of this Directive should perform their functions and duties in accordance with the general principles laid down in Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption[9], and Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules[10]. 
11. It is necessary for the development of aquaculture in the Community to increase the awareness and preparedness of the competent authorities and aquaculture production business operators in Member States with respect to the prevention, control and eradication of aquatic animal diseases. 
12. The competent authorities of Member States should have access to, and apply, state-of-the-art techniques and knowledge in the fields of risk analysis and epidemiology. This is of increasing importance because international obligations within the framework of the World Trade Organisation now focus on risk analysis in relation to the adoption of sanitary measures. 
13. It is appropriate to introduce at Community level a system of authorisation of aquaculture production businesses. Such authorisation would enable the competent authorities to establish a complete overview of the aquaculture industry, which would assist in the prevention, control and eradication of aquatic animal diseases. Furthermore, authorisation allows the laying down of specific requirements that must be fulfilled by the aquaculture production business in order to operate. Such authorisation should, where possible, be combined with or included in an authorisation regime which the Member States may already have established for other purposes, for example under environmental legislation. In addition, such authorisation would not be an extra burden to the aquaculture industry, taking into account the Proposal of 13 January 2004 for a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on services in the internal market[11], and in particular Article 6 thereof. 
14. Member States should refuse to issue an authorisation if the activity in question would pose an unacceptable risk of spreading diseases to other aquaculture animals or to wild stocks of aquatic animals. Before deciding to refuse an authorisation, consideration should be given to risk mitigation measures or alternative siting of the activity in question. 
15. The rearing of aquaculture animals for the purpose of human consumption falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs[12], as primary production. Obligations imposed on individual aquaculture production businesses under this Directive, such as record keeping, and internal systems enabling the aquaculture production business to demonstrate to the competent authority that relevant requirements of this Directive are being fulfilled, should where possible be combined with the obligations laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004. 
16. More attention should be paid to preventing disease occurrence than to controlling the disease once it has occurred. It is therefore appropriate to lay down minimum measures of disease prevention and risk mitigation which should be applied to the whole production chain in aquaculture, from fertilisation and hatching of eggs to the processing of aquaculture animals for human consumption, including transportation. 
17. In order to improve general animal health and assist in the prevention and control of animal disease through improved traceability, the movement of aquaculture animals should be recorded using a harmonised electronic animal movement system, such as that currently laid down in Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market[13]. Where appropriate, such movements should also be subject to animal health certification. 
18. In order to have an overview of the disease situation, to facilitate a rapid reaction in the case of a suspicion of disease and to protect farms or mollusc farming areas having a high animal health standard, a risk-based animal health surveillance should be applied in all such farms and mollusc farming areas. 
19. It is necessary to ensure that the main aquatic animal diseases at Community level do not spread. Harmonised animal health provisions for placing on the market should therefore be laid down with specific provisions applicable to species susceptible to those diseases. Therefore a list of such diseases and susceptible species should be laid down. 
20. The prevalence of such aquatic animal diseases is not the same throughout the Community. Reference should therefore be made to the concept of Member States which are declared disease-free, and when dealing with parts of the territory concerned, zones or compartments. General criteria and procedures for the granting, maintenance, suspension, restoration and withdrawal of such status should be laid down. 
21. In order to maintain and improve the general aquatic animal health status in the Community, Member States, zones or compartments declared free of one or more of the listed diseases should be protected against the introduction of such disease. However, in order to avoid the creation of unnecessary trade restrictions, the exchange of aquaculture animals between Member States, zones or compartments where one or more such diseases are present should be allowed, provided that risk mitigation measures are taken during transport. 
22. The slaughter and processing of aquaculture animals which are subject to disease control measures may spread the disease, inter alia as a result of the discharge of effluents containing pathogens from processing plants. It is therefore necessary for the Member States to have access to processing establishments that have been duly authorised to undertake such slaughter and processing without jeopardising the health status of farmed and wild aquatic animals, including in respect of the discharge of effluents. 
23. The designation of Community and national reference laboratories should contribute to the high quality and uniformity of diagnostic results. That objective can be achieved by activities such as the application of validated diagnostic tests and the organisation of comparative testing and training of staff from laboratories. 
24. Laboratories involved in the examination of official samples should work in accordance with internationally approved procedures or criteria based on performance standards and should use diagnostic methods that have, as far as possible, been validated. For a number of activities related to such examination, the European Standardisation Organisation (CEN), and International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) have developed European Standards (EN Standards) and ISO Standards respectively, appropriate for the purpose of this Directive. Such standards relate in particular to the operation and assessment of laboratories and to the operation and accreditation of control bodies. 
25. In order to ensure early detection of any possible outbreak of aquatic animal disease, it is necessary to oblige those in contact with aquatic animals of susceptible species to notify any suspect case to the competent authority. Routine inspections should be carried out in the Member States to ensure that aquaculture production business operators are familiar with, and apply, the general rules on disease control and biosecurity laid down in this Directive. 
26. It is necessary to prevent the spread of non-exotic but serious diseases in aquaculture animals as soon as an outbreak occurs by carefully monitoring movements of live aquaculture animals and products thereof, and the use of equipment liable to be contaminated. The choice of the measures to be used by the competent authorities should depend on the epidemiological situation in the Member State concerned. 
27. In order to advance the animal health status of the Community, it is appropriate that epidemiologically-based programmes to control and eradicate certain diseases are submitted by Member States for recognition at Community level. 
28. For diseases not subject to Community control measures, but which are of local importance, the aquaculture industry should, with the assistance of the competent authorities of the Member States, take more responsibility for controlling such diseases through self regulation and the development of “codes of practice”. However, it may be necessary, pending the establishment of such codes, for the Member States to implement certain control measures. Such national control measures must be justified, necessary and proportionate to the goals to be achieved, and should not affect the trade between the Member States. 
29. There is a continuous development in knowledge with respect to hitherto unknown diseases in aquatic animals. It may therefore be necessary for a Member State to apply control measures in the case of such emerging disease. Such measures should be swift and adapted to each individual case, but should not be maintained longer than necessary to achieve their goal. As such emerging diseases may also affect other Member States, all Member States and the Commission should be informed of the presence of an emerging disease and any control measures taken. 
30. It is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of maintaining and, in the event of an outbreak, quickly returning to a disease-free status in Member States, to lay down rules on the measures to increase disease preparedness. Outbreaks should be controlled as speedily as possible, if necessary by emergency vaccination, in order to limit the adverse effects on the production of, and trade in, live aquaculture animals and products thereof. 
31. Directive 2001/82/EC of 6 November 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products [14] and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency[15], require that, with only minor exceptions, all veterinary medicinal products that are placed on the market within the Community are to hold a marketing authorisation. In general, all vaccines used in the Community should have a marketing authorisation. However, the Member States may permit the use of a product without a marketing authorisation in the event of a serious epidemic subject to certain conditions, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. Vaccines against exotic and emerging diseases in aquaculture animals may qualify for such derogation 
32. This Directive should lay down provisions to ensure the necessary level of preparedness to effectively tackle the emergency situations related to one or more outbreaks of serious exotic or emerging diseases affecting aquaculture, in particular by drawing up contingency plans to combat them. Such contingency plans should be reviewed and updated regularly. 
33. Where the control of a serious aquatic animal disease is subject to harmonised Community eradication measures, Member States should be allowed to make use of financial contribution from the Community under Council Regulation (EC) No xxxx/200Y on the European Fisheries Fund[16]. Any application for Community support should be subject to scrutiny as regards compliance with control provisions laid down in this Directive. 
34. Live aquaculture animals and products thereof imported from third countries must not present an animal health hazard for aquatic animals in the Community. To that end, this Directive should set out measures for the prevention of the introduction of epizootic diseases. 
35. It is necessary in order to safeguard the aquatic animal health situation in the Community to further ensure that consignments of live aquaculture animals transiting through the Community comply with the relevant animal health requirements applicable to the species concerned. 
36. Import conditions should be consistent with the SPS Agreement. This Directive should therefore take into account the International Aquatic Animal Health Code and the Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals of the OIE. 
37. The placing on the market of ornamental aquatic animals involves a wide variety of species, often tropical species, solely for ornamental purposes. Those ornamental aquatic animals are normally kept in private aquariums or ponds, garden centres, or in exhibition aquariums, not in direct contact with Community waters. Consequently, ornamental aquatic animals held under such conditions do not pose the same risk to other sectors of Community aquaculture or to wild stocks. It is therefore appropriate not to lay down special provisions applicable to the placing on the market, transit and import of ornamental aquatic animals, kept under such conditions. 
38. However, where ornamental aquatic animals are kept outside closed systems or aquariums, in direct contact with the natural waters of the Community, they could pose a significant risk to Community aquaculture or wild stocks. That is particularly the case for the populations of carp ( Cyprinidae ), as popular ornamental fish such as koi-carp are susceptible to some diseases affecting other carp species farmed in the Community or found in the wild. In such cases, the general provisions of this Directive should apply. 
39. The setting up of electronic means of exchange of information is vital for simplification, for the benefit of the aquaculture industry and of the competent authorities. In order to meet that obligation, common criteria need to be introduced. 
40. Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 
41. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objectives of this Directive to provide for the approximation of the concepts, principles and procedures forming a common basis for aquatic animal health legislation in the Community. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty. 
42. The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[17]. 
43. It is appropriate to update Community animal health legislation concerning aquaculture animals and products thereof. Accordingly, Directives 91/67/EEC, 93/53/EEC and 95/70/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Directive, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Chapter I Subject matter, scope and definitions 
Article 1 Subject matter 
1. This Directive lays down: 
(a) the animal health requirements to be applied for the placing on the market, the importation and the transit of aquaculture animals and products thereof;

ANNEX I Definitions 
In addition to the definitions in Article 3, the following technical definitions shall apply: 
(a) ‘Compartment’ means one or more farms under a common biosecurity system containing an aquatic animal population with a distinct health status with respect to a specific disease. 
(b) ‘ Common biosecurity system’ means that the same aquatic animal health surveillance, disease prevention, and disease control measures are applied. 
(c) ‘ Containment area’ means an area around an infected farm or mollusc farming area where disease control measures are applied with the purpose of preventing the spread of the disease. 
(d) ‘Disease’ means a clinical or non-clinical infection with one or more aetiological agents in aquatic animals. 
(e) ‘Disease-free zones or compartments’ means zones or compartments declared disease free in accordance with Articles 49 or 50. 
(f) ‘Emerging disease’ means a newly recognised serious disease, the cause of which may or may not yet be established, that has the potential to be spread within and between populations, such as by way of trade in aquatic animals and/or aquatic animal products. It may also mean the recognition of a known disease in a new host species. 
(g) ‘ Epidemiological unit’ means a group of aquatic animals that share approximately the same risk of exposure to a disease agent within a defined location. This risk may be because they share a common aquatic environment, or because management practices make it likely that a disease agent in one group of animals would quickly spread to another group of animals. 
(h) ‘ Fallowing’ means for disease management purposes, an operation where a farm is emptied of aquaculture animals susceptible to the disease of concern or known to be capable of transferring the disease agent, and, where feasible, of the carrying water. 
(i) ‘ Further processing’ means processing of aquaculture animals before human consumption by any type of measures and techniques, affecting anatomical wholeness, such as bleeding, gutting/evisceration, heading, slicing and filleting, which produces waste or by-products and could cause a risk of spreading diseases. 
(j) ‘ Increased mortality’ means unexplained mortalities significantly above the level of what is considered to be normal for the farm or mollusc farming area in question under the prevailing conditions; what is considered to be increased mortality must be decided in cooperation between the farmer and the competent authority. 
(k) ‘ Infection’ means propagation of the disease agent in the host. 
(l) ‘Infected zone or compartment’ means zones or compartments where the infection is known to occur. 
(m) ‘ Quarantine’ means maintaining a group of aquatic animals in isolation with no direct or indirect contact with other aquatic animals, in order to undergo observation for a specified length of time and, where appropriate, testing and treatment, including proper treatment of the effluent waters. 
(n) ‘ Susceptible species’ means any species in which a certain disease agent can multiply or otherwise develop. 
(o) ‘ Zone’ means a precise geographical area with a homogeneous hydrological system comprising part of a water catchment area from the source(s) to a natural or artificial barrier that prevents the upward migration of aquatic animals from lower stretches of the water catchment area, an entire water catchment area from its source(s) to its estuary, or more than one water catchment area, including their estuaries, due to the epidemiological link between the catchment areas through the estuary.

ANNEX III Disease listing 
PART I CRITERIA FOR LISTING DISEASES 
A. Exotic diseases shall meet the following criteria laid down in point 1 and 2 or 3. 
1. The disease is exotic to the Community, as the disease is not established in Community aquaculture, and the pathogen is not known to be present in Community waters. 
2. It has potential for significant economic impact if introduced into the Community, either by production losses in Community aquaculture or by restricting the potential for trade in aquaculture animals and products thereof. 
3. It has potential for detrimental environmental impact if introduced into the Community, to wild aquatic animal populations of species, which are an asset worth protecting by Community or international provisions. 
B. Non-exotic diseases shall meet the following criteria laid down in point 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 2 or 3. 
1. Several Member States, or regions in several Member States, are free of the disease. 
2. It has potential for significant economic impact if introduced into a Member State that is free of the disease, either by production losses, and annual costs associated with the disease and its control exceeding 5% of the value of the production of the susceptible aquaculture animal species production in the region, or by restricting the possibilities for international trade in aquaculture animals and products thereof. 
3. The disease has shown, where it occurs, to have a detrimental environmental impact if introduced into a disease-free Member State, to wild aquatic animal populations of species that by Community or international provisions is an asset worth protecting. 
4. The disease is difficult to control and contain at farm level without stringent control measures and trade restrictions. 
5. The disease can be controlled at Member State level, experience having shown that disease-free compartments can be established and maintained, and that this maintenance is cost beneficial. 
6. During placing on the market, there is a likely risk that the disease will establish itself in a previously uninfected area. 
7. Reliable and simple tests for infected animals are available. The tests must be specific and sensitive and the testing method harmonised at Community level.

ANNEX V Requirements for declaring disease-free Member State, zone or compartment 
PART I DISEASE-FREE MEMBER STATE 
1. On historical grounds 
1.1. A Member State where susceptible species are present, but where there has not been any observed occurrence of the disease for at least for a period of 25 years before the date of entry of force of this Directive despite conditions that are conducive to its clinical expression may be considered disease-free where: 
(a) basic disease control conditions have been in place continuously for at least a period of 10 years before the date of entry into force of this Directive; and 
(b) infection is not known to be established in wild populations; and 
(c) the implementation of trade and imports conditions to prevent the introduction of the disease into the Member State is effective. 
A Member State wishing to benefit from a disease-free status as provided for in this point, must submit an application in accordance with Article 49 no later than 2 years after entry into force of this Directive. 
1.2. The basic disease control conditions referred to in point 1.1(a) shall consist, as a minimum of the following: 
(a) the disease is compulsorily notifiable to the competent authority, including notification of suspicion; and 
(b) an early detection system is in place throughout the Member State, enabling the competent authority to undertake effective disease investigation and reporting, and ensuring in particular: 
(i) the rapid recognition of any clinical signs consistent with suspicious of a disease, emerging disease, or unexplained mortality in farms or molluscs farming area s, and in the wild; and 
(ii) the rapid communication of the event to the competent authority with the aim to activating diagnostic investigation with minimum delay. 
1.3. The early detection system referred to in point 1.2 (b) must at least include the following: 
(a) broad awareness, among the personnel employed in aquaculture businesses or involved in the processing of aquaculture animals, of any signs consistent with the presence of a disease, and training of veterinarians or aquatic animal health specialists in detecting and reporting unusual disease occurrence; and 
(b) veterinarians or aquatic animal health specialists trained in recognising and reporting suspicious disease occurrence; and 
(c) access by the competent authority to laboratories with the facilities for diagnosing and differentiating listed and emerging diseases. 
2. Based on targeted surveillance 
A Member State where the last known clinical occurrence was within the period of 25 years before the date of entry into force of this Directive or where the infection status prior to targeted surveillance was unknown, because of the absence of conditions conducive to clinical expression, may be considered free from the disease where: 
(a) the Member State meets the basic disease control conditions laid down in point 1.2.; and 
(b) targeted surveillance in accordance with methods adopted pursuant to Article 49(3), has been in place for at least a period of two years before the date of entry into force of this Directive without detection of the disease agent on farm, or in mollusc farming areas that rears any of the susceptible species. 
Where there are parts of the Member State in which the number of farms, or molluscs farming areas are limited, and consequently targeted surveillance in these parts do not to provide sufficient epidemiological data, but in which there are wild populations of any of the susceptible species, those wild populations must be included in the targeted surveillance. 
PART II DISEASE-FREE ZONE OR COMPARTMENT 
1. Zones 
1.1. A zone may comprise: 
(a) an entire water catchment area from its source to its estuary; or 
(b) part of a water catchment area from the source(s) to a natural or artificial barrier that prevents the upward migration of aquatic animals from lower stretches of the water catchment area; or 
(c) more than one water catchment area, including their estuaries, due to the epidemiological link between the catchment areas through the estuary. 
The geographical demarcation of the zone shall be clearly identified on a map. 
1.2. Where a zone extends over more than one Member State, it can only be declared a disease-free zone if the conditions outlined in point 1.3, point 1.4 and point 1.5 apply to all areas of that zone. In that case both Member States concerned shall apply for approval for the part of the zone situated in their territory. 
1.3. A zone where susceptible species are present, but where there has not been any observed occurrence of the disease for at least a period of 25 years before the date of entry into force of this Directive, despite conditions that are conducive to its clinical expression may be considered disease-free if it complies mutatis mutandis with the requirements in Part I.1. 
A Member State wishing to benefit from a disease-free status as provided for in this point must notify its intention in accordance with Article 50(1) no later than 2 years after the entry into force of this Directive 
1.4. A zone where the last known clinical occurrence was within a period of 25 years before the date of entry into force of this Directive or where the infection status prior to targeted surveillance was unknown, because of the absence of conditions conducive to clinical expression, may be considered free from the disease where it complies mutatis mutandis with the requirements in Part I.2. 
1.5. A buffer zone in which a monitoring programme is carried out must be established, as appropriate. The demarcation of the buffer zones must be such that it protects the disease-free zone from passive introduction of the disease. 
2. Compartments comprising one or more farms or mollusc farming areas where the disease status is dependent on the disease status of surrounding natural waters 
2.1. A compartment may comprise one or more farms, a group or cluster of farms or a mollusc farming area that can be considered as one epidemiological unit due to geographical localisation and distance to other groups or clusters of farms, or molluscs farming areas, provided that all farms comprising the compartment are under a common biosecurity system. The geographical demarcation of a compartment shall be clearly identified on a map. 
2.2. A compartment where susceptible species are present, but where there has not been any observed occurrence of the disease for at least for a period of 25 years before the date of entry of force of this Directive despite conditions that are conducive to its clinical expression may be considered disease-free if it complies mutatis mutandis with the requirements in Part I.1 of this Annex. Member States wishing to benefit from this provision must notify their intention in accordance with Article 50(1) no later than 2 years after the entry into force of this Directive. 
2.3. A compartment where the last known clinical occurrence was within a period of 25 years before the date of entry into force of this Directive or where the infection status prior to targeted surveillance was unknown, because of the absence of conditions conducive to clinical expression, may be considered free from the disease where it complies mutatis mutandis with the requirements in Part I.2, and the disease is not known to occur in the waters surrounding the compartment. 
2.4. Each farm or mollusc farming area in a compartment shall be subject to additional measures imposed by the competent authority, when considered necessary to prevent the introduction of diseases. Such measures may include the establishment of a buffer zone around the compartment in which a monitoring programme is carried out, and the establishment of additional protection against the intrusion of possible pathogen carriers or vectors. 
3. Compartments comprising one or more individual farms where the disease status is independent of the disease status of the surrounding natural waters 
3.1. A compartment may comprise: 
(a) an individual farm which can be considered as a single epidemiological unit, as it is not influenced by the animal health status in the surrounding waters; or 
(b) more than one farm where each farm in the compartment complies with the criteria laid down in point 3.1.(a) and points 3.2 to 3.6, but, due to extensive movement of animals between farms, must be considered as a single epidemiological unit, and where all farms are under a common biosecurity system. 
3.2. A compartment must be supplied with water: 
(a) Through a water treatment plant capable of inactivating the relevant pathogen; however, such water treatment is not considered acceptable for use in a disease-free compartment where the disease is known to occur in the water feeding the treatment plant. 
(b) Directly from a well, a borehole or a spring. Where such water supply is situated outside the premises of the farm, the water must be supplied directly to the farm, and be channelled through a pipe. 
3.3. There must be natural or artificial barriers that prevent aquatic animals from entering each farm in a compartment from the surrounding watercourses. 
3.4. The compartment must, where appropriate, be protected against flooding and infiltration of water from the surrounding watercourses. 
3.5. The compartment must comply, mutatis mutandis , with the requirements laid down in Part I.2 of this Annex. 
3.6. A compartment shall be subject to additional measures imposed by the competent authority, when considered necessary to prevent the introduction of diseases. Such measures may include the establishment of additional protection against the intrusion of possible pathogen carriers or vectors. 
4. Special provisions for individual farms which commence or recommences their activities 
4.1. A new farm, which meets the requirements referred to in points 3.1.(a) and 3.2 – to 3.6 of this Part, but which commences its activities with aquaculture animals from a declared disease-free compartment may be declared disease-free without undergoing the sampling required for approval. 
4.2. A farm which recommences its activities after a break with aquaculture animals from a declared disease-free compartment, and meets the requirements referred to in points 3.1.(a) and points 3.2 to 3.6 of this Part, may be declared disease-free without undergoing the sampling required for approval provided that: 
(a) the health history of the farm over the last four years of its operation is known to the competent authority; however, if the farm concerned has been in operation for less than four years, the actual period in which it has been in operation will be taken into account; and 
(b) the farm has not been subject to animal-health measures in respect of the diseases listed in Part II of Annex III and there have been no antecedents of those diseases on the farm; and 
(c) prior to the introduction of the aquaculture animal, eggs or gametes, the farm is cleaned and disinfected, followed, as necessary, by a period of fallowing .

5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS 
5.1. Need for Community intervention 
5.1.1. Objectives pursued 
It is envisaged to update current Community legislation on diseases in aquaculture animals laid down in Council Directives 91/67/EEC, 93/53/EEC and 95/70/EC, with the objective to achieve better prevention and control of disease outbreaks in aquaculture animals and, the costs and losses and the negative impact to the whole of society due to aquatic animal diseases. 
Since fish, molluscs and crustaceans are listed in Annex II of the Treaty, one of the Community's tasks in the veterinary field is to improve the health status of such animals, thereby facilitating trade in aquaculture animals and products thereof to ensure the development of this sector. 
Furthermore, thanks to the adoption of other disease control measures envisaged under the current proposal, other savings should result from the expected reduced occurrence of diseases in aquaculture animals. It is, however, extremely difficult to quantify these savings. 
As mentioned already, these actions as such have no financial implications for the EU-budget. 
However, in combination with Council Decision 90/424/EC, as it is already the case with existing aquatic animal health legislation, has financial impact on Community budget: 
Objective 1: establishment of Community Reference Laboratories for aquatic animal diseases 
5.1.2. Measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation 
In 2000 the Advisory Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture (ACFA) proposed to initiate a project to update existing Community legislation on aquaculture animal health. The initiative was endorsed in the Communication from the Commission on a strategy for the sustainable development of European aquaculture ((Com (2002) 511). 
The designation of Community and national reference laboratories should contribute to the high quality and uniformity of diagnostic results. That objective can be achieved by activities such as the application of validated diagnostic tests and the organisation of comparative testing and training of staff from laboratories.

8. FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION 
8.1. Follow-up arrangements 
The Commission will have at its disposal several ways to evaluate the impact of the proposal: 
- the occurrence of future diseases in aquaculture animals giving an overall indication on the effectiveness of the new measures, 
- results of the risk based animal health surveillance programmes, 
- control measures on aquatic animal disease outbreaks. 
Already at this stage the Commission has the basic tools to monitor, such as the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and animal health and the network of Community and national reference laboratories. 
8.2. Arrangements and schedule for the planned evaluation 
As mentioned above, the Commission has at its disposal tools, such as the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health and the network of Community and national reference laboratories; these instruments will allow for the proper evaluation of the measures proposed. 
9. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES 
Not relevant 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. Context of the proposal 
• Grounds for and objectives of the proposal 
- The proposal from the Commission for a new Council Directive on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals, updates current disease control measures laid down in Council Directives 93/53/EEC and 95/70/EC, with the objective to achieve better control of outbreaks and to reduce the costs and losses and the negative impact to aquaculture industry due to diseases. 
- The proposal for a Council Regulation European Fisheries Fund (COM (2004) 497), allows Member States to allocate financial resources from the Operational Programmes set up in accordance with Title III of that Regulation, to control diseases in aquaculture animals, provided the diseases are referred to in Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field 
- By this proposal, the Commission envisages therefore the necessary amendments of the current procedures governing the Community’s financial contribution towards veterinary measures in aquaculture animals, laid down in Council Decision 90/424/EEC, in order to take into account the proposals for a new aquatic animal health Directive and the European Fisheries Fund. 
• General context 
- The proposed changes in Community legislation on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof should be made in parallel with amendments to Council Decision 90/424/EEC on Community expenditure in the veterinary field to bring it in line with the proposed new Directive and the proposal for the European Fisheries Fund (2007-2013), to ensure adequate financial support to the Member States in relation to the most serious diseases in aquaculture animals. 
- At present, Article 24 of Council Decision 90/424/EEC provides for a Community financial contribution eligible under Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 to be granted to the Member States for some of the expenditure which they may incur when eradicating infectious salmon anaemia and infectious haematopoietic necrosis. 
• Consistency with other policies 
- The proposal would not affect the future development of the Community policy on animal health and the veterinary fund. 
- This proposal is in line with the proposal from the Commission to the Council for Council Regulation European Fisheries Fund (COM (2004) 497). 
2. Consultation of interested parties and impact assessment 
• Consultation of interested parties 
- On the Proposal for a new Council Directive on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, consultation with Member States in Commission Working Group, stakeholder consultations and consultations with the aquaculture industry in the Advisory Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture has taken place. 
• Impact assessment 
- Impact assessments of the newly envisaged Council Directive on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof and of the amendments proposed by means of this proposal to Council Decision 90/424/EEC has been produced. 
3. Legal elements of the proposal 
• Summary of the proposed actions 
- The current proposal envisages the following changes to Decision 90/424/EEC: 
- to allow Member States to use the budget set up under Operational Programmes according to Title III of the European Fisheries Fund for the control and eradication of certain diseases in aquaculture animals. 
- to ensure that the procedures for such financial support, is in line with the current procedures applicable to financial contribution for control and eradication of terrestrial animal diseases. 
• Legal basis 
- Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof. 
• Subsidiarity principle 
- The measures laid down in this proposal falls under the competence of the Community. 
• Proportionality principle 
- The proposal sets out the procedures and sources of Community financial support to Member States for the control and eradication of certain diseases in aquaculture animals. 
• Choice of instruments 
- The proposed instrument is a Decision. This proposal concerns amendments to existing provisions on expenditure in the veterinary field that are laid down in a Council Decision. The legal instrument chosen to amend those provisions is therefore another Council Decision. 
4. Budget implications 
- Council Decision 90/424/EEC already allows for financial support in relation to outbreaks of Infectious Haematopoietic Necrosis (IHN) and Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA). Disease control actions for these diseases are currently eligible for a Community financial contribution under Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 solely. 
- It is proposed that future financial contributions for aquatic animal disease control from the Community should be eligible through the European Fisheries Fund (Article 32 of COM (2004) 497). 
- In the proposal, compulsory slaughter/eradication will only be required under Community rules in relation to outbreaks of diseases that are considered exotic to the Community. With respect to non-exotic diseases it is proposed that the Member States may decide whether an outbreak should be subject to eradication measures or containment measures. Community funding under the European Fisheries Fund may be made available for control measures of such diseases if the Member State so decides. 
- If an exotic disease did occur in the Community, it would have no additional financial impact on Community budget. The same would occur in case of compensation for eradication of non-exotic diseases, since the allocation of funds for the eradication are made within the Operational Programmes, whose budget is fixed by the Council at the beginning of the programming period. 
- In the interest of Member States, it would be convenient to assess the financial impact of eradication measures on their Operational Programmes. However, the costs related to such eradication measures are difficult to estimate, as there is limited experience in the Community of stamping out policy involving economic compensation in aquaculture. In the court case following the outbreaks of ISA in the UK and Ireland, one company owning five of the thirteen infected farms claimed total losses in the region of € 20-25 million. Sweden paid out compensation under national legislation totalling of 1.5 million SEK (€165 000) over a period of three years in relation to four cases of VHS in 1998. 
- It is therefore difficult to estimate the impact of the proposal on the European Fisheries Fund, as this will depend on the size of the farm(s) affected, the value of the animals kept at the farm(s), etc. However, the figures above can give an indication. 
2005/0154 (CNS) 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
amending Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[20], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament[21], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[22], 
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[23], 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field[24] provides for the possibility of a financial contribution from the Community to the Member States for the eradication of certain animal diseases. Currently, that Decision also provides for the possibility to grant such contribution for the eradication of the diseases infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) and infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN), both affecting salmonides. 
(2) Disease control actions for ISA and IHN are eligible for Community financial contributions under Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 of 17 December 1999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector[25] solely. 
(3) In the light of the adoption of Council Directive 200Y/xxx on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals[26], it is appropriate to amend Decision 90/424/EEC so that Community financial contribution should also be granted for eradication measures carried out by the Member States to combat other diseases in aquaculture animals, subject to Community control provisions. 
(4) The Member States have been granted financial contributions to support their national fisheries and aquaculture sector under Regulation (EC) No xxxx/2005 of zz/zz 2005 on the European Fisheries Fund[27]. Article 30a of that Regulation authorises Member States to allocate funds for the eradication of diseases in aquaculture under the terms of Decision 90/424/EC. 
(5) The funds for the eradication of diseases in aquaculture animals should be allocated within the Operational Programmes set up under Regulation (EC) No xxxx/2005, whose budget is fixed at the beginning of the programming period. 
(6) Financial contributions from the Community budget for disease control purposes in aquaculture animals should be subject to scrutiny regarding compliance with the control provisions laid down in Directive 200Y/xxx, in accordance with the same procedures that apply for such scrutiny and control for certain terrestrial animal diseases. 
(7) It is therefore appropriate to apply the procedures for financial contributions laid down in Decision 90/424/EEC, also to the use of financial contribution for the control of diseases in aquaculture animals under Regulation (EC) No xxxx/2005. 
(8) It is appropriate that the amendments proposed herein should enter into force at the same time as Directive 200Y/xxx and Regulation (EC) No XXXX/2005. 
(9) Decision 90/424/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,
