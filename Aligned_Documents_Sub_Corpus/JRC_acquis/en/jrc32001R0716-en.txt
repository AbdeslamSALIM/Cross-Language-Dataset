amending Regulation (EC) No 2789/1999 laying down the marketing standard for table grapes 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Article 2(2) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2789/1999 of 22 December 1999 laying down the marketing standard for table grapes(3) lays down provisions on the sizing, presentation and marking of table grapes. 
(2) In order to ensure transparency on the world market, those provisions should be amended. The standard for table grapes recommended by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe has recently been amended to permit the mixing in each package of table grapes of the varieties Chasselas rouge and Chasselas blanc, to provide for special labelling for grapes grown under glass and therefore subject to special rules on sizing, as well as for clarifying certain provisions concerning small consumer packages. 
(3) The production of several new varieties is growing. Those varieties should therefore be included in the list of varieties given in the Appendix to the Community standard for table grapes, either as large-berry varieties or as small-berry varieties. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,
