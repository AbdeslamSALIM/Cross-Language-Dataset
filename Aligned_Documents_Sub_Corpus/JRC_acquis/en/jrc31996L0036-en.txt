Commission Directive 96/36/EC of 17 June 1996 adapting to technical progress Council Directive 77/541/EEC relating to safety belts and restraint systems of motor vehicles (Text with EEA relevance) 
COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 96/36/EC of 17 June 1996 adapting to technical progress Council Directive 77/541/EEC relating to safety belts and restraint systems of motor vehicles (Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 95/54/EC (2), and in particular Article 13 (2) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 77/541/EEC of 28 June 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to safety belts and restraint systems of motor vehicles (3), as last amended by Commission Directive 90/628/EEC (4), and in particular Article 10 thereof, 
Whereas Directive 77/541/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EEC type-approval procedure which has been established by Directive 70/156/EEC; whereas, consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive; 
Whereas, in particular, Articles 3 (4) and 4 (3) of Directive 70/156/EEC necessitate that each separate Directive has attached to it an information document incorporating the relevant items of Annex I to that Directive and also a type-approval certificate based on Annex VI thereto in order that type-approval may be computerized; 
Whereas in the light of technical progress it is possible to improve the protection provided for passengers by requiring the installation of three-point belts with retractors for the rear outboard seats of motor vehicles of category M1; 
Whereas a warning should be fitted to all passenger seating positions where an airbag is installed, to inform the users of the vehicle that an airbag is present and consequently no rearward-facing child restraint should be fitted in that seat; whereas this Directive should be further amended when an optimum design of pictogram has been internationally accepted; 
Whereas it is possible to improve the protection provided for passengers against ejection in case of an accident by requiring a minimum of lap belts with retractors for all forward and rear-facing seating positions in motor vehicle sof categories M2 and M3, and in the case of certain M2 vehicles lap and diagonal belts, as foreseen in Directive 90/628/EEC (except those vehicles which are designed for both urban use and standing passengers); 
Whereas the entry force of an amendment to this Directive to require such seat belts in M2 and M3 vehicles is conditional upon the adaptation to technical progress of Council Directive 76/115/EEC (5), as last amended by Commission Directive 90/629/EEC (6), on seat belt anchorages, and Council Directive 74/408/EEC (7) on the strength of seats; 
Whereas the protection of passengers, especially in the centre rear seating position of cars, against both projection and ejection in the case of an accident must be improved and further modifications to the Directive should be introduced for this purpose; 
Whereas the effectiveness of the measures set out in this Directive for enhancing the protection of passengers in coaches and buses are dependant on the wearing of the seat belts prescribed; whereas this Directive needs to be complemented by an amendment to Council Directive 91/671/EEC (8) on the wearing of seat belts; 
Whereas reference is made to Council Directive 74/60/EEC (9), as last amended by Directive 78/632/EEC (10), relating to the interior fittings of motor vehicles; 
Whereas the provisions of this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Directive 70/156/EEC, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

The apparatus shall be positioned as described in that Annex and set to the maximum length of 840 mm. 
1.24. %quot%Airbag assembly%quot% means a device installed to supplement safety belts and restraint systems in power-driven vehicles, i.e. systems which, in the event of a severe impact affecting the vehicle automatically deploy a flexible structure intended to limit, by compression of the gas contained within it, the gravity of the contracts of one or more parts of the body of an occupant of the vehicle with the interior of the passenger compartment.
