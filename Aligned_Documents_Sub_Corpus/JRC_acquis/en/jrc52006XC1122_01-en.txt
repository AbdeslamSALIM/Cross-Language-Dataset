Objective of aid | Aid to SMEs | Yes This R%amp%D project is developing knowledge and technology in the field of composite piping systems and smart materials for a range of applications, including the energy and off-shore sectors. Various sectors need knowledge about pipes that can function in extreme circumstances and deliver information about the pipe's environment and the status of the pipe itself. The R%amp%D project concerns new technologies based on composites, fibre technology and advanced manufacturing technologies. Know-how and technology for the products in question are still at the R%amp%D stage. The application of composites in conjunction with the desired manufacturing methods also make it possible to introduce smart materials and smart sensors. This offers scope, for example, for condition monitoring in practical applications. Research is being carried out into whether this is technically feasible and what influence it has on the detailed design, system integration and take-up of composite piping systems in the possible areas of application |
