Proposal for a 
DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
on the identification of controls, tell-tales and indicators for two- or three-wheel motor vehicles 
(Codified version) 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. In the context of a people’s Europe, the Commission attaches great importance to simplifying and clarifying Community law so as to make it clearer and more accessible to the ordinary citizen, thus giving him new opportunities and the chance to make use of the specific rights it gives him. 
This aim cannot be achieved so long as numerous provisions that have been amended several times, often quite substantially, remain scattered, so that they must be sought partly in the original instrument and partly in later amending ones. Considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules. 
For this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if Community law is to be clear and transparent. 
2. On 1 April 1987 the Commission therefore decided[1] to instruct its staff that all legislative acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that the Community rules are clear and readily understandable. 
3. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. 
Codification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal Community legislative procedure. 
Given that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification , the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. 
4. The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 93/29/EEC of 14 June 1993 on the identification of controls, tell-tales and indicators for two- or three-wheel motor vehicles[3]. The new Directive will supersede the various Directives incorporated in it[4]; their content is fully preserved, and they are brought together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. 
5. The codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation , in all official languages, of Directive 93/29/EEC and the instrument amending it, carried out by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, by means of a data-processing system . Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table contained in Annex IV to the codified Directive.

DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
on the identification of controls, tell-tales and indicators for two- or three-wheel motor vehicles 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article Ö 95 Õ thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[5], 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[6], 
Whereas: 
ê 
(1) Council Directive 93/29/EEC of 14 June 1993 on the identification of controls, tell-tales and indicators for two- or three-wheel motor vehicles[7] has been substantially amended[8]. In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified. 
ê 2000/74/EC Recital 1 (adapted) 
(2) Ö Directive 93/29/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Directive 2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 March 2002 relating to the type-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles and repealing Council Directive 92/61/EEC[9] and lays down technical prescriptions concerning the design and construction of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles as regards the identification of controls, tell-tales and indicators. These technical prescriptions concern the approximation of the laws of the Member States to allow for the EC type-approval procedure provided for in Directive 2002/24/EC to be applied in respect of each type of vehicle. Consequently the provisions laid down in Directive 2002/24/EC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive. Õ 
ê 93/29/EEC Recital 6 (adapted) 
(3) In order to facilitate access to the markets of non-Community countries an equivalence Ö should exist Õ between the requirements of this Directive and those of Regulation No 60 of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. 
ê 
(4) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex III, Part B, 
ê 93/29/EEC

Article 4 
This Directive may be amended in accordance with Ö the procedure referred to in Article 13(3) Õ of [Council] Directive [70/156/EEC][10] in order to:

Ö (b) Õ adapt Ö Annexes I and II Õ to technical progress. 
Article 5 
Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the Ö main Õ provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.

Structure of the model base for the symbols referred to in section 2.1.5 
[pic] Figure 1 
Model base 
The model base consists of: 
1. a base 50 mm square, this dimension being equal to nominal dimension ‘a’ in the original; 
2. a base circle 56 mm in diameter having approximately the same area as the base square (1); 
3. a second 50 mm-diameter circle is drawn within the base square (1); 
4. a second square the tips of which lie on the base circle (2) Ö and Õ the sides of which are parallel to those of the base square (1); 
5. and 6. two rectangles having the same area as the base square (1), their sides being at right angles to each other and each of them devised so as to divide the opposite sides of the base square into symmetrical points; 
7. a third square the sides of which pass through the points of intersection of the base square (1) and the base circle (2) and are inclined at 45°, thus providing the greatest horizontal and vertical dimensions of the model base; 
8. an irregular octagon formed by lines inclined at 30° to the sides of the square (7). 
The base model is laid upon a grid the lower side of which measures 12.5 mm and coincides with the base square (1).
