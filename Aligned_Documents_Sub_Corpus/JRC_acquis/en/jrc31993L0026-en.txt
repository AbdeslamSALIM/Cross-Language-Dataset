COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 93/26/EEC of 4 June 1993 amending Council Directive 82/471/EEC concerning certain products used in animal nutrition 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 82/471/EEC of 30 June 1992 concerning certain products used in animal nutrition (1), as last amended by Council Directive 90/654/EEC (2), and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas Directive 82/471/EEC provides for regular amendment of the content of the Annex thereto as a result of developments in scientific or technical knowledge; 
Whereas it has been found necessary to alter provisions concerning the declaration on the label of compound feedingstuffs of products in the Annex belonging to the group 'hydroxyanalogues of amino acids'; 
Whereas a new technique enables to protect amino acids in order to avoid their degradation in the rumen of dairy cows and therefore to increase the availability of these nutriments in the intestine; whereas the use of protected amino acids appeared particular benefic for the dairy cow, the use of these products in animal nutrition should, therefore, be permitted; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Feedingstuffs, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
