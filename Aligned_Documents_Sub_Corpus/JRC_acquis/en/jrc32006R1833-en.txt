Commission Regulation (EC) No 1833/2006 
of 13 December 2006 
on the nomenclature of countries and territories for the external trade statistics of the Community and statistics of trade between Member States 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/95 of 22 May 1995 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods by the Community and its Member States with non-member countries [1], and in particular Article 9 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 750/2005 of 18 May 2005 on the nomenclature of countries and territories for the external trade statistics of the Community and statistics of trade between Member States [2] set out the version of that nomenclature which was valid as of 1 June 2005. 
(2) The alphabetical coding of countries and territories must be based on the current version of standard ISO alpha 2, insofar as it is compatible with the requirements of Community legislation and the statistical requirements of the Community. Commission Regulation (EC) No 2286/2003 of 18 December 2003 [3] amending Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code provided for a transitional period for the adaptation of automated customs clearance systems. Whereas that period has now expired, it is no longer necessary to use the numerical codes in parallel with the alphabetical codes. 
(3) Montenegro has become an independent State. 
(4) It is therefore appropriate to draw up a new version of the nomenclature which takes account of these developments and of changes affecting certain codes. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Statistics Relating to the Trading of Goods with Non-Member Countries, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
The version of the nomenclature of countries and territories for the external trade statistics of the Community and statistics of trade between Member States which shall be valid as from 1 January 2007 is set out in the Annex hereto. 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 2007. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
