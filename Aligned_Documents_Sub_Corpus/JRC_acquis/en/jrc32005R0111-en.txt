Council Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 
of 22 December 2004 
laying down rules for the monitoring of trade between the Community and third countries in drug precursors 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) The United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances adopted in Vienna on 19 December 1988, hereinafter referred to as the "United Nations Convention", is part of the worldwide effort to combat illegal drugs. Within its sphere of competence, the Community participated in the negotiation and concluded the Convention on behalf of the Community by means of Council Decision 90/611/EEC [1]. 
(2) Article 12 of the United Nations Convention concerns trade in substances frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. As provisions on trade in drug precursors affect Community rules in customs matters, it is appropriate to lay down Community rules on trade between the Community and third countries. 
(3) Article 12 of the United Nations Convention requires a system to monitor international trade in drug precursors, taking account of the fact that, in principle, trade in these substances is lawful. Consequently, measures have been taken to strike an appropriate balance between the desire to exploit all possible means to prevent drug precursors reaching illicit drug manufacturers and the commercial needs of the chemical industry and other operators. 
(4) To implement the requirements of Article 12 of the United Nations Convention and, taking account of the report of the Chemical Action Task Force created by the Houston Economic Summit (G-7) on 10 July 1990, Council Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 of 13 December 1990 laying down measures to be taken to discourage the diversion of certain substances to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances [2], established a system for reporting suspicious transactions. This system, which is based on close cooperation with operators, is reinforced through measures such as documentation and labelling, licensing and registration of operators as well as procedures and requirements governing exports. 
(5) Following the European Union Action Plan on Drugs 2000 to 2004, endorsed by the European Council at Feira in June 2000, the Commission organised an assessment of the Community control system of trade in drug precursors to draw conclusions from the implementation of Community legislation in this field. 
(6) According to that assessment and in order to improve the control mechanisms aiming at preventing diversion of drug precursors, it is necessary to extend monitoring requirements with regard to operators based within the Community facilitating trade between third countries, to introduce a Community approach with regard to procedures for granting licences and to strengthen monitoring requirements governing suspensive customs procedures. 
(7) Procedures and requirements for exports should be further intensified to target and concentrate controls on the most sensitive drug precursors, whilst reducing excessive administrative burden through simplified procedures for exports of high volume substances. While the effectiveness and practicability of pre-export notifications is fully recognised, a strategy should be developed striving to exploit the system to the fullest extent possible. 
(8) In order to address the heightened concern about the production of amphetamine-type stimulants, import control mechanisms for the main synthetic drug precursors should be further strengthened through common procedures and requirements allowing individual consignment-based controls to be carried out. 
(9) So as to allow operators to fulfil these requirements, provisions governing external trade in drug precursors should, to the extent possible, be aligned with the provisions governing intra-Community trade in drug precursors wholly obtained or produced, or released for free circulation, in the Community. 
(10) Taking account of the requirements of the internal market, and in the interests of this Regulation√¢&#x20AC;&#x2122;s effectiveness, uniform application of the provisions should be ensured through adoption of comparable and converging means of action by Member States. 
(11) Mutual assistance between the Member States and between the Member States and the Commission should be reinforced, in particular by recourse to Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters [3]. 
(12) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of preventing the diversion of drug precursors for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances to lay down rules for the thorough monitoring of trade between the Community and third countries of these substances. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty. 
(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [4]. 
(14) Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 should therefore be repealed. 
(15) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised, in particular, by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

MONITORING OF TRADE 
SECTION 1 
Documentation and labelling 
Article 3 
All imports, exports or intermediary activities involving scheduled substances shall be documented by the operators by way of customs and commercial documents, such as summary declarations, customs declarations, invoices, cargo manifests, transport and other shipping documents. 
Those documents shall contain the following information: 
(a) the name of the scheduled substance as stated in the Annex, or, in the case of a mixture or a natural product, its name and the name of any scheduled substance, as stated in the Annex, contained in the mixture or in the natural product, followed by the term "DRUG PRECURSORS"; 
(b) the quantity and weight of the scheduled substance and, in the case of a mixture or a natural product, the quantity, weight, and, if available, the percentage of any scheduled substance contained therein; and 
(c) the names and addresses of the exporter, the importer, the ultimate consignee and, where applicable, the person involved in the intermediary activities. 
Article 4 
The documentation referred to in Article 3 shall be kept by the operators for a period of three years from the end of the calendar year in which the operation took place. The documentation shall be organised in such a way, electronically or in paper form, that it is readily available for inspection by the competent authorities upon request. The documentation may be provided via image medium or other data medium, provided that the data, when made readable, match the documentation in appearance and content, are available at all times, can be made readable without delay and can be analysed by automated means. 
Article 5 
Operators shall ensure that labels are affixed on any packaging containing scheduled substances indicating their name as stated in the Annex, or, in the case of a mixture or a natural product, its name and the name of any scheduled substance, as stated in the Annex, contained in the mixture or in the natural product. Operators may, in addition, affix their customary labels. 
SECTION 2 
Licensing and registration of operators 
Article 6 
1. Operators established in the Community, other than customs agents and transporters when acting solely in that capacity, engaged in import, export or intermediary activities involving scheduled substances listed in Category 1 of the Annex, shall hold a licence. The licence shall be issued by the competent authority of the Member State in which the operator is established. 
In considering whether to grant a licence, the competent authority shall take into account the competence and integrity of the applicant. 
The committee procedure shall be used to lay down provisions determining cases where a licence is not required, setting out further conditions for the granting of licences and establishing a model for licences. These provisions shall guarantee a systematic and consistent control and monitoring of operators. 
2. The licence may be suspended or revoked by the competent authorities whenever the conditions under which the licence was issued are no longer fulfilled or where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is a risk of diversion of scheduled substances. 
Article 7 
1. Operators established in the Community, other than customs agents and transporters when acting solely in that capacity, engaged in import, export or intermediary activities involving scheduled substances listed in Category 2 of the Annex, or in the export of scheduled substances listed in Category 3 of the Annex, shall register immediately and update as necessary the addresses of the premises at which they conduct those activities. This obligation shall be carried out with the competent authority in the Member State in which the operator is established. 
2. The committee procedure shall be used to establish the conditions for exemption from the controls of certain categories of operators and of operators engaged in the export of small quantities of scheduled substances listed in Category 3. These conditions shall ensure that the risk of diversion of scheduled substances is minimised. 
Article 8 
1. When the scheduled substances are entered into the customs territory of the Community for unloading or transhipment, for temporary storage, for their storage in a free zone of control type I or a free warehouse, or for their placing under the Community external transit procedure, the licit purposes must be demonstrated by the operator, upon request by the competent authorities. 
2. The committee procedure shall be used to establish the criteria to determine how the licit purposes of the transaction may be demonstrated, in order to ensure that all movements of scheduled substances within the Community customs territory can be monitored by the competent authorities and the risk of diversion be minimised. 
SECTION 3 
Provision of information 
Article 9 
1. Operators established in the Community shall notify the competent authorities immediately of any circumstances, such as unusual orders and transactions involving scheduled substances, which suggest that such substances intended for import, export or intermediary activities might be diverted for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. 
2. Operators shall provide the competent authorities with information in summary form about their export, import or intermediary activities. The committee procedure shall be used to determine the information that is required by the competent authorities in order to allow them to monitor these activities. 
Article 10 
1. In order to facilitate cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States, operators established in the Community and the chemical industry, in particular as regards non-scheduled substances, the Commission shall, in consultation with the Member States, draw up and update guidelines. 
2. These guidelines shall provide, in particular: 
(a) information on how to identify and notify suspect transactions; 
(b) a regularly updated list of non-scheduled substances to enable the industry to monitor on a voluntary basis the trade in such substances. 
3. The competent authorities shall ensure that the guidelines are regularly disseminated in accordance with the objectives of these guidelines. 
SECTION 4 
Pre-export notification 
Article 11 
1. All exports of scheduled substances listed in Category 1 of the Annex and exports of scheduled substances listed in Categories 2 and 3 of the Annex to certain countries of destination, shall be preceded by a pre-export notification sent from the competent authorities in the Community to the competent authorities of the country of destination, in accordance with Article 12(10) of the United Nations Convention. The committee procedure shall be used to determine the list of the countries of destination in order to minimise the risk of diversion by ensuring systematic and consistent monitoring of exports of scheduled substances to these countries. 
The country of destination shall be allowed a period of 15 working days to reply, at the end of which the export operation may be authorised by the competent authorities of the Member State of export, if no advice from the competent authorities of the country of destination is received indicating that this export operation might be intended for the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. 
2. In the case of the scheduled substances to be notified in accordance with paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the Member State concerned shall, prior to the export of such substances, supply the information specified in Article 13(1) to the competent authorities of the country of destination. 
The authority supplying such information shall require the authority in the third country receiving the information to keep confidential any trade, business, commercial or professional secret or any trade process referred to therein. 
3. Simplified pre-export notification procedures may be applied by the competent authorities where they are satisfied that this will not result in any risk of diversion of scheduled substances. The committee procedure shall be used to determine such procedures and to establish the common criteria to be applied by the competent authorities. 
SECTION 5
