Commission Regulation (EC) No 606/2006 
of 19 April 2006 
amending Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards the grant of aid for skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder intended for animal feed and the sale of such skimmed-milk powder 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products [1], and in particular Article 15 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 7(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999 [2] fixes the amount of aid for skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder intended for animal feed taking into account the factors set out in Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. In view of the developments in the market price of skimmed-milk powder, of the increase in the market prices for competing proteins, and of the reduction of the supply of skimmed-milk powder, the amount of aid should be reduced. 
(2) Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(3) The Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time-limit set by its chairman, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
