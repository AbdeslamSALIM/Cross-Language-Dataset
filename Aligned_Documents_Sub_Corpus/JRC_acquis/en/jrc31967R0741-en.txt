REGULATION (EEC) No 741/67 OF THE COUNCIL of 24 October 1967 on aid from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof: 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission; 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1): 
Whereas with the introduction of a system of a uniform and compulsory refunds on exports to third countries on the achievement of a single market for agricultural products, which has to a large extent existed since 1 July 1967, the criterion of the lowest average refund laid down in Article 3 (1) (a) of Regulation No 25 (2) on the financing of the common agricultural policy is no longer valid for the financing of refunds: 
Whereas the abolition of that criterion makes it necessary to discard the so-called %quot%basic products%quot% method defined in Article 2 of Council Regulation No 17/64/EEC (3) of 5 February 1964 on the conditions for granting aid from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund : whereas, however, Articles 2, 3 and 4 of that Regulation must continue to apply until the entry into force of the common prices for milk products as regards reimbursement of the cost of the aids to production required to enable the target price to be reached: 
Whereas at present Member States are reimbursed by the Community for their expenditure in connection with the common organization of the market in agricultural products only after a considerable delay ; and whereas this must be remedied by making interim payments until the accounts for the periods 1964/65, 1965/66 and 1966/67 can be finally settled: 
Whereas, for the accounting periods 1967/68 and 1968/69, account should be taken of Council Regulation No 130/66/EEC (4) of 26 July 1966 on the financing of the common agricultural policy and steps taken to have payments made more often and sooner after the time when the action entailing the expenditure is taken in Member States: 
Whereas final dates should be laid down for the Commission's decisions on interim payments and aid from the Fund, in order to ensure the satisfactory working of the agricultural markets, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Article 3 (1) (a) of Regulation No 25, as amended by Article 8 of Regulation No 130/66/EEC, shall be replaced by the following:
