amending Regulation (EC) No 1092/2001 as regards in particular the marketing year for lemons sent for processing 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 of 28 October 1996 introducing a Community aid scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1933/2001(2), and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In recent years the production and processing of Community lemons has moved from late spring and summer to autumn and winter as a result of changes in the varieties planted by traders. The marketing year for lemons laid down in Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1092/2001 of 30 May 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 introducing a Community aid scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits(3) should therefore be amended, in order to adapt it to these new circumstances. The period covered by the marketing year should be the same as that for other citrus fruits, from 1 October to 30 September of the following year. 
(2) This amendment to the marketing year entails changes to other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1092/2001, in particular the equivalent period, the dates for signing contracts and amendments thereto, the dates for submitting aid applications and making aid payments, and the dates on which notifications must be made. 
(3) To facilitate the transition between the old and new marketing year, transitional provisions should be adopted to extend the 2001/02 marketing year to cover the period 1 June to 30 September 2002. 
(4) These transitional provisions concern, in particular, the establishment of special amendments to contracts in force in 2001/02 to extend them until 30 September 2002, the dates for submitting aid applications and the granting of aid for the extension period, the amount of aid and the notifications to the Commission. 
(5) The amendment of the date of the marketing year for lemons makes it necessary to amend the equivalent period. For the purposes of calculating the aid for the 2002/03 marketing year, any overrun of the threshold for the 2001/02 marketing year is to be assessed on the basis of the average quantities processed with aid during the three equivalent periods preceding the marketing year for which the aid must be fixed, extending from 1 April of one marketing year to 31 March of the next. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,
