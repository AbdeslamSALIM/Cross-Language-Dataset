THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(1), and in particular Article 53(1) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries(2), and in particular Article 22(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) As regards, in particular, food, Article 53(1)(b)(iii) of Regulation (EC) No 17/2002 provides for the adoption of any appropriate interim measure where it is evident that food imported from a third country is likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health or the environment. 
(2) In accordance with Directive 97/78/EC, the necessary measures must be adopted as regards the import of certain products from third countries where anything likely to constitute a serious danger for animal or human health appears or develops. 
(3) The presence of nitrofurans has been detected in poultrymeat and shrimps intended for human consumption and imported from Thailand. 
(4) Since the presence of this substance presents a potential risk for human health, all consignments of poultrymeat and shrimps imported from Thailand should be sampled and analysed in order to demonstrate their wholesomeness. 
(5) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 has set up the Rapid Alert System for Food and recourse to it is appropriate for implementing the mutual information requirement laid down in Directive 97/78/EC. 
(6) This Decision will be reviewed in the light of the guarantees offered by the competent Thai authorities and on the basis of the results of the tests carried out by the Member States. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
