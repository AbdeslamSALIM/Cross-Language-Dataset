DEVELOPMENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES' ACCOUNTING SYSTEM 
A number of public administrations have broadened their accounting systems from giving information only on budget execution to be more dynamic and complete by setting out a full picture of their economic situation and of their assets and liabilities. In recent years, the European Communities have recognised the advantage of modernising their accounts to change from a system of accounts focusing on a cash-based description of budget expenditure and revenue operations to a system based on assets and liabilities with the objective of presenting the Communities' financial situation in a more comprehensive form, showing all its assets, entitlements and debts as well as the expenditure and revenue for the financial year. The Commission therefore undertook to fall into line with the approach adopted by a large number of States and supported by international bodies such as IFAC [1] and OECD. This work started in earnest in 2003 with the commencement of the "modernisation of the accounting system" project, which had the aim of placing the European Communities in the forefront of the international movement towards the modernisation of public sector accounting from 2005 onwards. 
The Financial Regulation [2] lays down the broad outlines of the new accounting framework for the European Communities from 2005. The transitional provisions of the Financial Regulation include the general rule that the provisions of Title VII of part one — Accounting — shall apply gradually depending on technical possibilities in order to be fully effective for the budgetary year 2005. This gradual application relates in particular to the new principles governing the Institutions' accounts. 
As planned, in January 2005 the new accounting system came into use, together with a new set of accounting rules and a new chart of accounts. While the budget accounts are still based on movements of cash, the general accounts are now accrual-based. These new rules and methods are based on internationally accepted standards for the public sector — the IPSAS — and, for accounting transactions that are not yet covered by IPSAS, on the relevant IAS/IFRS. They have been adopted by the Accounting Officer of the Commission after receiving the opinion of an Accounting Standards Committee that provided independent professional guidance. The IT architecture was updated to ensure that each accounting event, and not just cash movement, may be fully registered when it occurs. Improvements will continue to be made to the IT systems to further the integration of systems and to provide better management reporting. The financial statements from 2005 onwards will be able to be produced directly from the central IT system. Directorates-Generals' internal control procedures are extended to cover accrual accounting aspects. Finally, the scope of consolidation will be extended in 2005 to include the various Community agencies. 
Thus these financial statements for 2004 are the last to be prepared under the transitional provisions of the Financial Regulation. None-the-less, while not fully accrual-based, the Commission has already introduced elements of accrual accounting in the presentation of these and previous financial statements, without yet being able to apply the corresponding standards in full. For the financial year 2004 the information did not come from an integrated system of accounts, so the Accounting Officer's departments used non-accounting information from the Commission's services to complete the balance sheet and draw up its annexes. 
It is also highlighted that the balance sheet and off-balance sheet presented here at 31/12/2004 will differ from the opening balance sheet that will be included in the 2005 annual accounts, since they are prepared under different rules. 
PRESENTATION OF THE ACCOUNTS 
1. The consolidated annual accounts are drawn up in accordance with Article 121 of the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities. 
They are drawn up by the Commission every year and record the budgetary and accounting data of all the European Institutions. 
2. The annual accounts of the Communities are set out in three volumes: 
Volume I — | Consolidated reports on implementation of the budget and consolidated financial statements | 
Volume II — | Part 1: | Commission — Reports on implementation of the budget and financial statements | 
Part 2: | Commission — Detailed reports on implementation of the budget | 
Volume III — | European Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Ombudsman, the European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Coal and Steel Community (in liquidation) | 
Under the transitional provisions of the Financial Regulation, for accounts relating to financial years prior to 2005, the Commission's accounting officer must, in accordance with Article 128(2) and Article 181(2) of the Financial Regulation, prepare the provisional consolidated annual accounts and send them to the Court of Auditors by 1 May of the following year, together with the provisional annual accounts of each Institution and body consolidated therewith in. 
The final annual accounts will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities together with the statement of assurance given by the Court of Auditors by 30 November of the following year in accordance with Articles 129 and 181 of the Financial Regulation.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 
[1] International Federation of Accountants. 
[2] OJ L 248, 16.9.2002. 
-------------------------------------------------- 
ANNEX 1 
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, RULES AND METHODS 
A. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES 
1. LEGAL PROVISIONS 
The accounts are kept in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of this Financial Regulation. The annual accounts for 2004 are the third drawn up in accordance with this Financial Regulation, on the basis of the transitional provisions mentioned below. 
The same rules of valuation and accounting methods are applied in all the European Institutions currently falling within the scope of consolidation (Commission, Parliament, Council, Court of Justice, Court of Auditors, Economic and Social Committee, Committee of the Regions, the Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor), in order to guarantee harmonisation of the accounts and consistency of data. The exception to this rule is the European Coal &amp; Steel Community ("ECSC") in liquidation which was consolidated for the first time in 2003. There are some differences in certain accounting treatments between the ECSC in liquidation and the other Institutions since the ECSC in liquidation currently applies certain accrual accounting principles more extensively than the Communities' Institutions. Given the transition to accrual accounting in 2005 and the immateriality of the differences in question it was not considered useful or appropriate to make corrections for the amounts. 
2. THE FINANCIAL REGULATION 
The Financial Regulation adopted by the Council on 25 June 2002 (OJ L 248 of 16 September 2002, p. 1, with a corrigendum in OJ L 25 of 30 January 2003, p. 43) brings together the provisions on the presentation of accounts and accounting in Title VII of Part One. 
While this Financial Regulation is applicable from 1 January 2003, Article 181 contains a number of transitional provisions, some of which relate to the presentation of the accounts. 
This is particularly the case with regards to the timetable for the presentation of accounts which will be shifted forward by about one month from 2006 onwards to give the discharge authority an extra month for its deliberations. Article 128 stipulates that, starting with the annual accounts for 2005, the Commission's accounting officer must submit the consolidated provisional accounts by 31 March of the following year, on the basis of the provisional accounts that each Institution and other consolidated bodies have sent by 1 March. These accounts are sent to the Court of Auditors, who must make its observations by 15 June (Article 129). On the basis of these observations, the Commission adopts the final consolidated accounts by 31 July and they are then published by 31 October together with the Court of Auditors' statement of assurance. 
The transitional provisions lay down the general rule that the provisions of Title VII of Part One shall apply gradually depending on technical possibilities in order to be fully effective for the budgetary year 2005. This gradual application relates in particular to the new principles governing the Institutions' accounts. 
Under the transitional provisions of the new Financial Regulation, for accounts relating to financial years prior to 2005, the Accounting Officer of the Commission must, in accordance with Article 128(2) and Article 181(2) of the Financial Regulation, prepare the provisional consolidated annual accounts and send them no later than 1 May to the Court of Auditors together with the individual provisional annual accounts of each Institution (and other consolidated bodies). 
Both the provisional and final annual accounts for 2004 are presented as follows: Volume I contains the consolidated accounts, Volume II the Commission's accounts and Volume III the individual accounts of the other consolidated Institutions and the ECSC in liquidation. 
3. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES 
The objectives of financial statements are to provide information about the financial position, performance and cashflows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users. For a public sector entity such as the European Communities, the objectives are more specifically to provide information useful for decision making, and to demonstrate the accountability of the entity for the resources entrusted to it. 
If they are to present a true and fair view, financial statements must not only supply relevant information to describe the nature and range of an Institution's activities, explain how it is financed and supply definitive information on its operations, but do so in a clear and comprehensible manner which allows comparisons between financial years. It is with these goals in mind that the present document has been drawn up. 
The accounting system of the European Institutions comprises general accounts and budget accounts. These accounts shall be kept in euro on the basis of the calendar year. 
The budget accounts give a detailed picture of the implementation of the budget. They are based on the modified cash accounting principle. [1] 
The general accounts show all charges and income for the financial year and are designed to establish the financial position in the form of a balance sheet at 31 December. 
Article 124 of the Financial Regulation sets out the accounting principles to be applied in drawing up the financial statements: 
- going concern basis; 
- prudence; 
- consistent accounting methods; 
- comparability of information; 
- materiality; 
- no netting; 
- reality over appearance; 
- accrual-based accounting. 
However, the transitional provisions of the Financial Regulation indicate that these principles will apply gradually depending on technical possibilities in order to be fully effective for the budgetary year 2005. For example, the financial statements for 2004 take account of certain elements of the principle of prudence and accrual accounting, such as value adjustments for entitlements, depreciation and the entry of carryovers in the accounts as charges for the financial year. 
As the annual accounts for 2005 will be prepared on a different basis than these accounts, i.e. full accrual accounting, in accordance with the EC accounting rule 14, adjustments will have to be made to the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 presented here so as to arrive at the opening, accrual based, balance sheet at 1 January 2005 (for example, the inclusion of pre-financing amounts.) 
B. ACCOUNTING RULES AND METHODS 
1. CURRENCY AND BASIS FOR CONVERSION 
1.1 Accounts are kept in euros. 
1.2 Except for the headings set out below, assets and liabilities are converted into euros on the basis of the conversion rates applying on 31 December 2004: 
€1 | CYP 0,5800 | 
€1 | CZK 30,4640 | 
€1 | DKK 7,4388 | 
€1 | EEK 15,6466 | 
€1 | GBP 0,7051 | 
€1 | HUF 245,9700 | 
€1 | LVL 0,6979 | 
€1 | LTL 3,4528 | 
€1 | MTL 0,4343 | 
€1 | PLN 4,0845 | 
€1 | SKK 38,7450 | 
€1 | SIT 239,7600 | 
€1 | SEK 9,0206 | 
€1 | USD 1,3621 | 
€1 | JPY 139,6500 | 
Different conversion methods apply to the following headings: 
- tangible and intangible assets, which retain their value in euros at the rate that applied at the date when they were purchased; 
- commitments outstanding, some of which are commitments in national currencies, were revalued using the rates for December; 
- pre-financing paid under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, which are converted at the exchange rates applying on the 10th day of the month following the month in which they are granted. 
1.3 Monetary items other than those listed above are revalued at the closing euro rate on the date the accounts are closed. The revalued figure is treated as follows: 
- cash assets: the contra-entry for the positive and negative exchange differences relating to cash assets is recorded in the economic outturn for the year; 
- monetary items other than cash assets: overall the exchange differences on assets and commitments expressed in a specific currency are recorded in the economic outturn for the year. 
1.4 Revenue (and expenditure) in other currencies is converted using a monthly rate. 
2. REVENUE 
2.1 The amounts of own resources and financial contributions entered in the accounts are those credited in the course of the year to the accounts opened in the Commission's name by the governments of the Member States. 
The difference between the amount of VAT own resources, GNI-based resources and financial contributions entered in the budget and the amount actually due is calculated by 1 July of the following year and entered in an amending budget for that year. 
2.2 The other revenue entered in the accounts is the amount actually received in the course of the year. 
3. EXPENDITURE 
3.1 For the purposes of calculating the budget outturn for the year, expenditure comprises payments made against the year's appropriations for payments plus any of the appropriations for that year that are carried over to the following year. 
3.2 Payments made against the year's appropriations for payments means payments that are made by the accounting officer by 31 December of the financial year. In the case of the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, the payments are those effected by the Member States between 16 October 2003 and 15 October 2004, provided that the accounting officer was notified of the commitment and authorisation by 31 January 2005. EAGGF guarantee expenditure may be subject to a clearance decision following controls in the Member States. 
4. ECONOMIC OUTTURN FOR THE YEAR 
The economic outturn shows the result of the Communities' activities by applying a number of elements of the accrual accounting principle. The explanatory notes specify which elements have been taken into account. 
The economic outturn consists of the budget outturn, the economic outturn of the ECSC in liquidation, the result of the adjustments and the result of borrowing and lending activities. 
4.1 Budget outturn 
The budget outturn comprises two elements: the result of the European Communities and the result of the participation of the EFTA countries belonging to the EEA. In accordance with Article 15 of Regulation No 1150/2000 on own resources, this outturn represents the difference between: 
- total revenue received for that year; 
- and total payments made against that year's appropriations plus the total amount of that year's appropriations carried over to the following year. [2] 
The following are added to or deducted from the resulting figure: 
- the net balance of cancellations of payment appropriations carried over from previous years and any payments which, because of fluctuations in the euro rate, exceed non-differentiated appropriations carried over from the previous year, 
- the balance of exchange-rate gains and losses recorded during the year. 
The budget outturn is paid back to the Member States the following year. 
4.2 Result of adjustments 
During 2004 (and previous years), the accounting was based on the cash principle. In order to give a more accurate picture of assets and liabilities, the financial situation and the result, a number of adjustments are necessary at year-end. These adjustments correct the items of capital spending and receipts charged to expenditure and revenue in accordance with the cash-based principle and allow non-budget expenditure and revenue to be entered in the accounts. 
As a result of these adjustments, the annual accounts can be presented in accordance with the principle of modified accrual accounting, based on modified cash budget accounting. 
4.3 Result of borrowing and lending activities 
Borrowing and lending activities are off-budget operations provided for in the Treaties. Pursuant to the principle of budgetary equilibrium, the Communities may not finance its activities by borrowing. 
However, a number of provisions of the Treaties establishing the Communities have led to the creation of various instruments authorising the Commission, on behalf of the Communities, to borrow on the financial markets to make loans in order to enable the final recipients to benefit from the advantageous conditions that the Communities can secure on these markets. 
The result of "borrowing and lending activities" is mentioned separately as part of the economic outturn. The result is paid back to the general budget of the Communities. A reserve has also been set up for future risks. 
4.4 Economic outturn of the ECSC in liquidation 
The economic outturn of the ECSC in liquidation represents the difference between its revenues and expenses for the year arising from the liquidation of its financial operations, investment movements and its contributions to the Research Fund for Coal &amp; Steel. This result is not paid back to the Communities but kept within the ECSC in liquidation to finance its future activities. 
5. RULES ON VALUATION 
Except where indicated in the explanatory notes to the balance sheet, the various headings are valued as follows: 
5.1. Tangible and intangible fixed assets are valued at their acquisition price, with the exception of assets produced by the European Communities, which are valued at their production cost, and assets acquired free of charge that are valued at their market value. Tangible and intangible fixed assets are valued at their historic value converted into euros at the rate applying when they were purchased. The book value of a fixed asset is equal to its acquisition price or production cost, plus or minus revaluations, depreciation and other amounts written off. 
Assets covered by finance leases are valued at the date of entry into force of the lease at the lower of the market value of the asset or the discounted value of the minimum lease payments due, in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 2909/2000 of 29 December 2000. 
Except for land, assets under construction, pre-financing paid out and works of art, these fixed assets must also be subject to depreciation, according to the straight line method (Title IV, Chapter 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2909/2000 of 29 December 2000 on the management in the accounts of the non-financial fixed assets of the European Institutions) at the following rates: 
Depreciation rates 
Type of asset | Straight line depreciation rate | 
Computer software | 25 % | 
Computer hardware | 25 % | 
Kitchens — Cafeterias — Nurseries 
Small electrical equipment | 25 % | 
Cash registers | 25 % | 
Large kitchen equipment | 12,5 % | 
Specialist furniture for kitchens, cafeterias | 12,5 % | 
Specialist furniture for nurseries | 25 % | 
Plant, machinery and tools | | 
Telecommunication and audiovisual equipment 
Telephone and fax machines | 25 % | 
Headphones, earphones, microphones | 25 % | 
Cameras | 25 % | 
Videos | 25 % | 
Video and dictating machines | 25 % | 
Projectors (slides and overhead) | 25 % | 
Photographic equipment | 25 % | 
Projector screens | 25 % | 
Televisions, radios, monitors (not including computers) | 25 % | 
Technical equipment 
Printers, mail, security, building, tools | 12,5 % | 
Measuring or laboratory equipment | 25 % | 
Other plant, machinery and tools | 12,5 % | 
Movable shelving, partitions, false floors, false ceilings and wiring | 25 % | 
Vehicle fleet | 25 % | 
Furniture | 10 % | 
Buildings | 4 % | 
Land | n.a. | 
5.2 Stocks: Office supplies and other consumer goods are valued at the price of the last supplies received. 
Scientific equipment: stocks of heavy water, fissile material and samples for industrial and scientific use are valued every year and entered in the balance sheet at the acquisition price or re-sale cost of the last supplies received or the market price, whichever is the lower. 
5.3 Financial fixed assets are valued at their purchase price. If denominated in foreign currency, they are converted at the euro rate applying at the close of the year. In line with the principle of prudence, an adjustment is made where there is a probable loss in value. 
5.4 Entitlements are entered in the accounts at their face value, converted at the euro rate applying at the end of the year, with the exception of entitlements denominated at a fixed rate. Value adjustments are calculated and entered in the accounts for this purpose. A value reduction or write-down is thus applied for amounts considered irrecoverable. 
Two types of value reduction exist: 
- a specific write-down applied when a given amount is deemed irrecoverable, irrespective of any legal developments (the risk of non-recovery is thus examined for each debt); 
- a flat-rate write-down applied when the amount of the irrecoverable debt is not known. Entitlements due for more than one year are written down by 20 %. A further cut of 20 % is made for each additional year. After five years entitlements which have not yet been received are thus completely written down. 
5.5 Cash investments and disposable assets are valued at their face value/purchase price converted into euros at the rate applying at the end of the year. For the sake of prudence, an adjustment is made where there is a probable loss in value. 
5.6 Debts are valued at their face value converted into euros at the rate applying at the end of the year if they are denominated in a foreign currency. 
5.7 Provisions are valued/accounted for, where possible, in accordance with IPSAS 19. Details of their calculation and basis are given in the related explanatory notes. 
6. PRE-FINANCING 
Pre-financing amounts for operational purposes are included in the year's expenditure and do not appear as assets in the balance sheet. 
Pre-financing amounts to public or private intermediaries which had not been received by the final beneficiary at 31 December 2004 and which are included in the year's budget expenditure are entered on the assets side of the balance sheet as short-term assets, under sundry debtors. 
7. CONSOLIDATION 
The consolidated accounts cover the accounts of the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor. Following the entry in force of the Treaty of Nice on 1 February 2003, the Member States have entrusted the European Commission with the management of the ECSC in liquidation. As a result, the financial statements of the ECSC in liquidation were consolidated in the European Communities accounts for the first time in 2003. Consolidated for the first time in 2004 was the newly created Institution, the European Data Protection Supervisor. The consolidation method used for all the above is that of full consolidation, in line with IPSAS 6. 
There are two entities consolidated using the equity method, the joint undertaking with the European Space Agency, Galileo, and the Communities' investment in the European Investment Fund. 
Article 121 of the Financial Regulation provides for the consolidation of the Institutions and certain agencies set up in the Member States of the European Union. The scope of consolidation will be extended in the 2005 annual accounts to the bodies mentioned in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation. 
Not included on the balance sheet of the European Communities are the funds managed by the Commission on behalf of both the Sickness Insurance Scheme for staff of the European Communities, and the European Development Fund. At 31 December 2004 the total assets of both were EUR 246 million and EUR 18.6 billion respectively. 
[1] This differs from cash-based accounting because of elements such as carryovers. 
[2] In the case of the EFTA-EEA countries, the volume of appropriations carried over from year n to year n+1 is known after the accounts have been closed. As a result the calculation of the balance includes carryovers of appropriations from year n-1 to year n.

ANNEX 2 
EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE REPORTS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUDGET 
A. GENERAL BUDGET AND TYPES OF APPROPRIATION 
The general budget, the main instrument of the Communities' financial policy, is the instrument which provides for and authorises the Communities' revenue and expenditure every year. 
The budgetary procedure is set out in Article 272 of the EC Treaty which stipulates the sequence of stages and the time-limits which must be respected by the two arms of the budgetary authority: the Council and Parliament. Every year, the Commission estimates all the European Institutions' revenue and expenditure for the coming year and draws up a preliminary draft budget which it sends to the budgetary authority. On the basis of this preliminary draft budget, the Council draws up a draft budget which is then the subject of negotiations between the two arms of the budgetary authority. The President of Parliament declares that the budget has been finally adopted making the budget enforceable. The task of executing the budget is mainly the responsibility of the Commission. 
Unless otherwise stated, the following budgetary provisions refer to the Financial Regulation adopted by the Council on 25 June 2002 (OJ L 248, 16 September 2002, p. 1 and corrigendum OJ L 25, 30 January 2003, p. 43) which applies with effect from 1 January 2003. 
1. BUDGETARY PRINCIPLES 
The general budget of the Communities is governed by a number of basic principles: 
- unity and budget accuracy: all Communities' expenditure and revenue must be incorporated in a single budget document, must be booked on a budget line and expenditure must not exceed authorised appropriations; 
- universality: this principle comprises two rules: 
- the rule of non-assignment, meaning that budget revenue must not be earmarked for specific items of expenditure (total revenue must cover total expenditure); 
- the gross budget rule, meaning that revenue and expenditure are entered in full in the budget without any adjustment against each other; 
- annuality: the appropriations entered are authorised for a single year and must therefore be used during that year; 
- equilibrium: the revenue and expenditure shown in the budget must be in balance (estimated revenue must equal payment appropriations); 
- specification: each appropriation is assigned to a specific purpose and a specific objective; 
- unit of account: the budget is drawn up and implemented in euros and the accounts are presented in euros; 
- sound financial management: budget appropriations are used in accordance with the principle of sound financial management, namely in accordance with the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness; 
- transparency: the budget is established and implemented and the accounts presented in compliance with the principle of transparency — the budget and amending budgets are published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. 
2. BUDGET STRUCTURE 
The budget consists of: 
a) a general statement of revenue; 
b) separate sections divided into the statements of revenue and expenditure of each Institution: Section I: Parliament; Section II: Council; Section III: Commission; Section IV: Court of Justice; Section V: Court of Auditors; Section VI: Economic and Social Committee; Section VII: Committee of the Regions; Section VIII: Part A. Ombudsman, Part B. European Data Protection Supervisor. 
Each Institution's items of revenue and expenditure are classified according to their type or the use to which they are assigned under titles, chapters, articles and items. 
A part of the funds of the ECSC in liquidation were placed at the disposal of the operational budget of the ECSC in liquidation. This operational budget was adopted annually by the Commission, after consultation with the Council and the European Parliament. The last budget was drawn up for the period of 1st January to 23 July 2002. As from 24 July 2002, the revenue and charges connected with the operational budget are included in the revenue and expenditure account of the ECSC in liquidation. The remaining commitments to be fulfilled are shown on the liability side of the balance sheet. 
3. STRUCTURE OF THE ACCOUNTS 
Only the Commission budget contains administrative appropriations and operating appropriations. The other Institutions have only administrative appropriations. 
The budget distinguishes between two types of appropriation: non-differentiated appropriations and differentiated appropriations. Non-differentiated appropriations are used to finance operations of an annual nature (which comply with the principle of annuality). Differentiated appropriations were introduced in order to reconcile the principle of annuality with the need to manage multi-annual operations. 
a) Non-differentiated appropriations cover: 
- all the administrative sections of the budget (Chapter 1 of the Commission Section and the whole of every other section); 
- EAGGF Guarantee appropriations of an annual nature; and 
- certain technical appropriations (repayments, borrowing and lending guarantees, etc.) 
In the case of non-differentiated appropriations, the amount of commitment appropriations is the same as that of payment appropriations. 
b) Differentiated appropriations are intended to cover multi-annual operations and comprise the appropriations in all Chapters except Chapter 1 of the Commission Section (not including EAGGF.) 
These differentiated appropriations break down into commitment appropriations and payment appropriations: 
- commitment appropriations: cover the total cost of the legal obligations entered into for the current financial year for operations extending over a number of years. [1] However, budgetary commitments for actions extending over more than one financial year may, in accordance with Article 76(3) of the Financial Regulation, be broken down over several years into annual instalments where the basic act so provides. For the differentiated appropriations, budget commitments not yet made for future years are shown as a contingent liability in the off balance sheet (under point 6). 
- payment appropriations: cover expenditure arising from commitments entered into in the current financial year and/or earlier financial years. [2] 
4. ORIGIN OF APPROPRIATIONS 
The main source of appropriations is the Communities' budget for the current year. However, there are other types of appropriations resulting from the provisions of the Financial Regulation. They come from previous financial years or outside sources. 
4.1 Final Budget Appropriations 
— Initial budget appropriations adopted 
— Transfers 
Appropriations may be transferred between lines in accordance with the rules laid down in Articles 22 to 24 of the Financial Regulation. [3] 
— Amending budgets 
The budget adopted may be amended or increased by an amending budget. The rules are set out in Articles 37 and 38 of the Financial Regulation. 
4.2 Appropriations carried over from previous year or made available again 
— Appropriations automatically carried over 
These are non-differentiated payment appropriations which may be carried over automatically for one financial year only (no limits for the ECSC in liquidation) in accordance with Article 9(4) of the Financial Regulation. 
— Appropriations carried over by decision of the Institutions 
An Institution may decide to carry over appropriations from the previous budget in one of two cases: if the preparatory stages have been completed (Article 9(2)(a) of the Financial Regulation) or if the legal base is adopted late (Article 9(2)(b)). Both commitment and payment appropriations may be carried over (Article 9(3)). 
— Appropriations made available again as a result of decommitments 
This involves the re-entry of commitment appropriations concerning structural funds which have been decommitted. Amounts can be re-entered by way of exception in the event of error by the Commission or if they are indispensable for completion of the programme (Article 157 of the Financial Regulation). 
4.3 Assigned revenue 
— Refunds 
These appropriations arise from the refund of amounts paid in error, proceeds from the supply of goods/services to other Communities' bodies, insurance payments received and revenue from lettings and publication sales — the amounts are assigned revenue on the budget line which incurred the initial expenditure, (Financial Regulation Article 10 and Article 18(1) (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j)), and may be carried over without limit. 
— EFTA appropriations 
The agreement on the European Economic Area provides for financial contribution by its members to certain activities in the Communities' budget. The budget lines concerned and the amounts projected are published in Annex III of the Communities' budget. The lines concerned are increased by the EFTA contribution. Appropriations not used at the end of the year are cancelled and returned to the EEA countries. In prior years these amounts were classified within budget appropriations and not as assigned revenue. 
— Revenue from third parties 
As with the EFTA appropriations other countries have concluded agreements with the European Communities involving a financial contribution to Communities' activities. The amounts received are considered to be revenue from third parties which is allocated to the budget lines concerned (often in the field of research) and may be carried over without limit (Article 10 and Article 18(1)(a) and (d) of the Financial Regulation). 
— Work for third parties 
As part of their research activities, the Communities' research centres may work for outside bodies, (Article 161(2) of the Financial Regulation). Like the revenue from third parties, the work for third parties is assigned to specific budget lines and may be carried over without limit (Article 10 and Article 18(1)(e) of the Financial Regulation). 
— Appropriations made available again as a result of repayment of payments on account 
These are Communities' funds which have been repaid by the beneficiaries. Repayments of payments on account are entered as assigned revenue (Articles 10 and 18(2) of the Financial Regulation) and may be carried over without limit. In the area of Structural Funds the re-inscription is based on a Commission Decision (Article 18(2) of the Financial Regulation and Article 228 of its Implementing Rules). 
5. COMPOSITION OF APPROPRIATIONS AVAILABLE: 
- Final budget appropriations = initial budget appropriations adopted + amending budget appropriations + transfers; 
- Additional appropriations = assigned revenue (see above) + appropriations carried over from the previous financial year or made available again following decommitments; 
- Total appropriations authorised = final budget appropriations + additional appropriations; 
- Appropriations for the year (as used to calculate the budgetary result) = final budget appropriations + assigned revenue. 
6. BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION 
Article 48(1) of the Financial Regulation states: "The Commission shall implement ... the budget in accordance with this Regulation, on its own responsibility and within the limits of the appropriations authorised." 
Article 50 states that the Commission shall confer on the Institutions the requisite powers for the implementation of the sections of the budget relating to them. 
6.1 Execution of revenue 
The budget takes over the revenue forecasts subject to any changes resulting from the adoption of amending budgets which adjust the forecasts in the initial budget in line with the reductions or increases in revenue established during implementation. The budget revenue covers appropriations for payment. 
The revenue outturn comprises established entitlements, revenue actually collected against these established entitlements and the balance to be recovered. 
The actual revenue for a financial year corresponds to the revenue collected against entitlements established in the course of the year and amounts collected against entitlements still to be recovered from previous years. 
6.2. Execution of expenditure 
As with revenue, expenditure is forecast in the initial budget. The execution of expenditure shows how appropriations for commitments [4] and appropriations for payments [5] are changed, used, carried over and lapse during the year. 
6.2.1. Utilisation of appropriations: 
- Appropriations for commitments: The appropriations authorised are available during the financial year for entering into commitments. 
- Appropriations for payments: The appropriations authorised are available during the financial year for making payments. 
6.2.2. Carryovers to the following year: 
Appropriations for commitments: 
Some types of appropriation which are not committed may be carried over automatically, as is the case with assigned revenue (Article 10 of the Financial Regulation). 
Carryovers may be authorised by the Institutions: 
- if most of the preparatory stages of the commitment procedure have been completed by 31 December (Article 9(2)(a) of the Financial Regulation); or 
- if the legal base is adopted in the final quarter of the financial year (Article 9(2)(b) of the Financial Regulation.) 
The budgetary authority must be notified of this decision (Article 9(5) of the Financial Regulation). 
Appropriations for payments: 
As is the case for commitment appropriations, unused payment appropriations from assigned revenue are carried over automatically. 
- non-differentiated appropriations: carryover is generally automatic if it is to cover outstanding commitments (Article 9(4) of the Financial Regulation); 
- differentiated appropriations: unused payment appropriations usually lapse; however, they may be carried over by Commission decision if the payment appropriations for the following financial year will not cover existing commitments or commitments linked to commitment appropriations which have themselves been carried over (Article 9(3) of the Financial Regulation). 
6.2.3. Cancellation of appropriations: 
Any appropriations for commitment and for payment not used and not carried over are cancelled at year-end (Article 9(1) of the Financial Regulation). 
7. OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS 
With the introduction of differentiated appropriations, a gap developed between commitments entered into and payments made: this gap, corresponding to outstanding commitments, represents the time-lag between when the commitments are entered into and when the corresponding payments are made. 
B. FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE 
The 2004 financial year was the fifth covered by the financial perspective 2000-2006, concluded on 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, on the basis of the conclusions of the Berlin European Council of 24 and 25 March 1999 which called for tighter budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure. 
In concluding an agreement of this type, the Institutions agreed in advance on the main budgetary priorities for the following period and established a framework for Communities' expenditure in the shape of the financial perspective. The financial perspective shows the maximum amount and the composition of foreseeable Communities' expenditure. 
As the initial financial perspective was drawn up in constant 1999 prices, point 15 of the Agreement states that each year the Commission will make a technical adjustment to the financial perspective in line with movements in the Gross National Income (GNI) of the European Union and prices. However, it was agreed that a deflator of 2 % would be used for agriculture and the Structural Funds. 
The overall ceiling on appropriations for commitments for 2004 comes to EUR 115,434 million, equivalent to 1.12 % of GNI. The corresponding ceiling on the appropriations for payments comes to EUR 111,380 million, i.e. 1.08 % of GNI. 
The following table shows the adjusted financial perspective for EU-25 at 2004 prices and the adjusted financial perspective at current prices.

C. STRUCTURAL ACTIONS: THE PROGRAMMING PERIOD 2000-2006 
The Communities' Structural Funds consist of the ERDF, the ESF, the EAGGF Guidance Section and the FIFG. [6] The Structural Funds come under heading 2 "Structural operations" of the financial perspective, which also covers the Cohesion Fund. 
This programming period is based on the new Structural Funds Regulation, the main elements of which are as follows: 
1. STRUCTURAL ACTIONS 
The Structural Funds are the main instrument for attaining increased economic and social cohesion in the Communities. The Union supports three specific objectives with appropriations from the Structural Funds: 
Objective 1 : development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind 
Objective 2 : economic and social conversion of areas in structural difficulty; 
Objective 3 : adaptation and modernisation of policies and systems for education, training and employment. 
There is a special scheme covering restructuring in the fisheries sector outside Objective 1 regions. Rural development projects are implemented across the EU, financed by either the Structural Funds or the Common Agricultural Policy. 
Other structural actions are Communities' initiatives covering the following fields: 
a) Interreg: cross-border, trans-national and interregional cooperation intended to encourage the harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of the whole of the Communities area. 
b) Urban: economic and social regeneration of cities and of urban neighbourhoods in crisis with a view to promoting a sustainable urban development. 
c) Leader: rural development. 
d) Equal: trans-national cooperation to promote new means of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market. 
2. FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE AND PROGRAMMING 
The financial perspective for 2000-06 sets out the overall and annual totals for all the Structural Funds. It was drawn up at constant 1999 prices and is thus adjusted every year by an index of 2 % (with a technical revision, if necessary, in 2003 for 2004-06) in line with Communities' inflation. 
The initial financial programming was based on the annual allocations in the financial perspective for all the Funds and corresponds to the financing plans in the programming documents initially adopted. 
3. COMMITMENT AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES 
3.1. Commitment procedure 
The budget commitments, made in annual tranches, are based on the initial or revised financial plans in the programming documents. The first annual tranche is committed when the Commission approves the decision relating to the operation. 
The Commission then commits the annual tranches by 30 April of each year and automatically decommits any commitments not used within two years. 
3.2. Payment procedure 
The Commission makes a payment on account amounting to 7 % of the total contribution from the Structural Funds once the programme is adopted. This payment may be subdivided over two budget years. The payment on account will have to be reimbursed if no expenditure is declared within 18 months. The Commission then makes interim payments to reimburse actual expenditure certified by the Member State. The balance of 5 % is paid on the closure of the programme once all the documents required are submitted and approved by the Commission. 
Payments are posted to the earliest open commitment. 
D. COMMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED REPORTS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUDGET FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2004 
REVENUE 
The revenue of the general budget of the European Communities can be divided into two main categories: own resources and other revenue. This is laid down in Article 269 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities, which states that: "Without prejudice to other revenue, the budget shall be financed wholly from own resources." The main bulk of budgetary expenditure is financed by own resources. Other revenue represents only a minor part of total financing. 
There are three categories of own resources: traditional own resources, the VAT resource and the GNI resource. Traditional own resources, in turn, comprise agricultural duties, sugar levies and customs duties. A correction mechanism in respect of budgetary imbalances is also part of the own resources system. 
1. Traditional own resources, Title 1 of the statement of revenue 
Traditional own resources: All established amounts of traditional own resources must be entered in one or other of the accounts kept by the competent authorities. 
- In the ordinary account provided for in Article 6(3)(a) of Regulation No 1150/2000: all amounts recovered or guaranteed. 
- In the separate account provided for in Article 6(3)(b) of Regulation No 1150/2000: all amounts not yet recovered and/or not guaranteed; amounts guaranteed but challenged may also be entered in this account. 
For the separate account, the Member States send the Commission a quarterly statement that includes: 
- the balance to be recovered during the previous quarter, 
- the amounts recovered during the quarter in question, 
- rectifications of the base (corrections/cancellations) during the quarter in question, 
- amounts written off, 
- balance to be recovered at the end of the quarter in question. 
The information sent in by the Member States does not allow the amounts recovered during the year to be assigned to the year in which the entitlements arose. Hence the column for amounts received against carryovers in the table "Consolidated summary of the implementation of budget revenue, 2004" includes amounts received during the year and the amount of entitlements cancelled and replaced by the new amount of entitlements declared by the Member States when making their new statement. A value reduction is applied to own resources entitlements (see explanatory note to asset item VII.B.2 in the balance sheet). 
When the traditional own resources from the separate account are recovered, they must be entered in the Commission's account with the treasury or the body appointed at the latest on the first working day following the 19th day of the second month following the month during which the entitlement was recovered. 
2. VAT resources and GNI resources 
VAT own resources derive from the application of a uniform rate, for all countries, to the harmonised VAT base determined in accordance with the rules of Article 2(1)(c) of the Council Decision of 29 September 2000. The VAT base is capped at 50 % of GNI for all Member States. 
The GNI resource is a variable resource intended to supply the revenue required, in any given year, to cover expenditure exceeding the amount collected from traditional own resources, VAT resources and miscellaneous revenue. The revenue derives from the application of a uniform rate to the aggregate GNI of all the Member States. 
VAT and GNI resources are determined on the basis of forecasts of VAT and GNI bases made when the preliminary draft budget is being prepared. These forecasts are subsequently revised; the figures are updated during the budget year in question by means of an amending budget. 
The final figures for the VAT and GNI bases are available in the course of the year following the budget year in question. The Commission calculates the differences between the amounts due by the Member States by reference to the final bases and the sums actually paid on the basis of the (revised) forecasts. These VAT and GNI balances, either positive or negative, are called in by the Commission from the Member States for 1 December of the year following the budget year in question. Corrections may still be made to the final VAT and GNI bases in subsequent years. The balances calculated earlier are adjusted and the difference is called in at the same time as the VAT and GNI balances for the previous budget year. It should be noted that corrections made in 2004 relating to the period 1995-2003 for GNI resources were EUR 232.2 million and for VAT resources, EUR 232.8 million. 
3. UK correction 
This mechanism reduces the own resources payments of the UK in proportion to what is known as its "budgetary imbalance" and increases the own resources payments of the other Member States correspondingly. The budgetary imbalance correction mechanism in favour of the United Kingdom was instituted by the European Council in Fontainebleau (June 1984) and the resulting Own Resources Decision of 7 May 1985. The purpose of the mechanism was to reduce the budgetary imbalance of the UK through a reduction in its payments to the Communities. 
The explanatory table for Chapter 15 in the consolidated summary of the implementation of the revenue budget shows each Member State's contribution to the UK correction. 
4. Adjustment of the European Communities' system of own resources 
The Council Decision of 29 September 2000 on the system of the European Communities' own resources [7] was adopted following the Berlin European Council of 24- 25 March 1999. Article 2(3) of this Decision states that Member States shall retain, by way of collection costs, 25 % of traditional own resources instead of 10 %. However the rate of 10 % remains applicable for the amounts of traditional own resources that should have been made available before 28 February 2001. This Decision entered into force on 1 March 2002, backdated to 1 January 2001. 
EXPENDITURE 
This section describes the main categories of Communities' expenditure, classified by heading of the financial perspective. It should be noted that certain expenditure, including expenditure made under the Agriculture and Structural Operations headings, is provisional at the time it is paid, and thus may be subject to corrections in future financial years. 
Heading 1 — Agriculture 
Expenditure under heading 1 is financed by the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF). 
Heading 2 — Structural operations: the objective of economic and social cohesion 
This expenditure is for structural aid measures, designed to promote better economic and social cohesion within the Communities. The Communities' contribution must be accompanied by national funding and so involves cooperation between the Commission and Member States' authorities. 
Heading 3 — Internal policies 
It is primarily since the adoption of the Single European Act and with a view to speeding up the completion of the internal market that the Communities has broadened some of its existing policies — in the field of research, for example — or launched new policies. Since 1993 these internal policies have been brought together under a single heading of the financial perspective, forming an extremely diversified group. 
Heading 4 — External action 
This heading of the financial perspective covers all Communities' expenditure in favour of third countries, except for enlargement-related expenditure on the candidate countries and expenditure under the European Development Fund (EDF). Enlargement-related aid has been given a specific heading in the financial perspective for 2000-06 (see "Heading 7: Pre-accession aid"). Some of these measures are of a horizontal nature (thematic), whereas others are defined by geographical areas. 
Heading 5 — Administrative expenditure 
This heading of the financial perspective covers all the expenditure on the running of the Communities' Institutions. For the Institutions other than the Commission, these costs make up the bulk of their expenditure. 
Heading 6 — Reserves 
This heading covers three types of reserve designed to leave the necessary margins available, beneath the total ceiling on expenditure of the financial perspective, to meet expenditure which could not be foreseen when the budget was drawn up. Each reserve has a clearly identified object in a specific field. 
Heading 7 — Pre-accession aid 
As regards enlargement-related expenditure for the ten candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe, a new heading, 7, has been created to cover the three pre-accession instruments established in the financial perspective for 2000-06: the agricultural instrument (SAPARD), the structural instrument (ISPA) and the Phare programme. 
Heading 8 — Compensation 
In accordance with the political agreement that the new Member States should not become net-contributors to the budget at the very beginning of their membership, compensation of EUR 1,410 million was foreseen under this heading in 2004. This amount will be available as transfers to them to balance their budgetary receipts and contributions. 
UTILISATION OF EXPENDITURE BY THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES: 
1. Pre-financing payments and payments of balances 
The new Financial Regulation draws a distinction between four different types of payment: 
- payment of the entire amount due; 
- prefinancing, which may be divided into a number of payments; 
- interim payments; 
- payment of the balance of the amounts due. 
A distinction must be made in the accounts between these different types of payment at the time they are made; this will have the advantage of removing any uncertainty about the payment. As part of the project to modernise the accounting systems and move to full accrual accounting, pre-financing amounts outstanding will be included on the assets side of the balance sheet. The balance sheet at 31 December 2004, as with previous years, is not prepared under these new rules and so does not include such amounts as assets — see also Assets VII.B.4 Sundry debtors for further explanation. 
EAGGF Guarantee — modulations/cross compliance: these are the "modulations" adopted by the Member States under Article 3(2) and Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1259/99. Under the common agricultural policy, Member States are allowed to reduce payments due to farmers under certain aid schemes and to finance additional rural development measures with the sums withheld. Amounts not used by the end of the third financial year following that during which they are withheld must be repaid to the Commission.

2. Appropriations carried over relating to contributions by and work for third parties 
Appropriations carried over from the previous financial year in respect of contributions by and work for third parties, which by definition never lapse, are included with the additional appropriations for the financial year. This explains the difference between carryovers from the previous year in the 2004 budget implementation statements and those carried over to the following year in the budget implementation statements. 
3. 2004 budget outturn 
The appropriations made available again following the repayment of payments on account are disregarded when calculating the outturn for the year. 
The EFTA-EEA part of the payment appropriations carried over by the Communities from 2004 to 2005 could not be included in the 2004 balance as this is subject to the approval by EFTA of the amounts in question, and this will not be given until mid-2005. 
Total budget revenue for the year comes to EUR 103,512 million (2003: EUR 93,469 million.) Total budget expenditure comes to EUR 99,195 million (2003: EUR 88,395 million), when the negative expenditure under EAGGF Guarantee EUR 1,383 million (2003: EUR 659 million) is taken into account. This negative expenditure comprises: amounts recovered as a result of fraud and irregularities, correction of advances made on the basis of Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999, any profit deriving from sales from public stocks, the additional levy on surplus milk production and the financial consequences of clearance of accounts decisions. 
The payment appropriations carried over which the Communities have cancelled include the appropriations corresponding to contributions by and work for third parties carried over from 2003 to 2004 (EUR 1,044 million) as these appropriations are included with the appropriations for the financial year (see also Point A, paragraph 4.3 Assigned Revenue).

ANNEX 3 
EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE BALANCE SHEET 
COMMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2004 
Establishment of the balance-sheet 
The balance sheet is drawn up in accordance with: 
- Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities; 
- Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the Financial Regulation; 
- Commission Regulation No 2909/2000 of 29 December 2000 on the management in the accounts of the non-financial fixed assets of the European Institutions (OJ L 336, 30.12.2000); 
- Accounting and consolidation manual of the European Communities, drawn up by the Accounting Officer of the Commission, setting out the rules on valuation and accounting methods to be applied by all the Institutions in order to establish a uniform set of rules for accounting, valuation and presentation of the accounts with a view to harmonising the process for drawing up the financial statements and consolidation, as required by article 133 of the above mentioned Financial Regulation. 
In connection with the modernisation of the Commission's accounting system and the shift towards application of the new, accrual based accounting rules for the 2005 annual accounts, gradual changes in accounting methods are both inevitable and necessary. Some changes have already been made to the methods applied to produce the 2004 annual accounts. These changes are explained in the notes and comparative figures are provided. 
A. ASSETS 
II. INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS 
Intangible fixed assets are identifiable non-monetary assets without physical substance. To be entered on the assets side of the balance sheet, they must be controlled by the Institution and generate future economic benefits for the European Communities. 
Computer software developed within the Institutions does not constitute an intangible fixed asset, whereas a computer licence, governed by an inter-institutional framework contract for database management does, and so is included here.

III. TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS 
A. Land and buildings: 
Commission: In the absence of historical data on the costs of acquisition and the costs of annual improvements before 1998 in the Joint Research Centre, acquisition values are based on a valuation conducted by an outside firm at 31 December 1997. It has been possible to calculate the changes that occurred during the period 1998-2004. 
The method of depreciation is as follows: 
1. For buildings that had been fully depreciated at 1 January 1998, a new depreciation plan was fixed. They were revalued and depreciated over a period of ten years up to 2007. 
2. For buildings which had not been fully depreciated at 1 January 1998, depreciation was calculated over their residual life having due regard to the revalued amount at 1 January 1998. 
This method of valuation and depreciation, applied by Ispra in 2000, was used to value land and buildings of the JRC at Geel at end-2001. The JRC site at Ispra has, during the year, finished construction/alternation work on their building to a value of EUR 22.2 million and this amount has therefore been transferred from assets under construction to land and buildings. 
In some countries the value of the land occupied by Delegations cannot be distinguished from the value of the building. 
In May 1998 the Parliament invoked its purchase option in respect of a complex in Brussels (consisting of three buildings) for which the final investment cost (not including land) came to EUR 1,097 million. In two memoranda of understanding with the European Communities dated 23 July 1998, Belgium made a contribution to the purchase of the land and the development and construction costs for the third building. A clause stipulates that if Parliament were to relocate, either the land would be returned to the Belgian State for a payment of EUR 0.025, or the land and buildings would be put up for sale so that the market value of the land could be paid to the Belgian State. An adjustment has therefore been made for the value of the land, which is now entered in the balance sheet at EUR 0.025. 
In December 2003 the Parliament invoked its purchase option for the Louis Weiss building in Strasbourg and the purchase agreement was signed in February 2004 — see below, under E. Finance Leases and similar entitlements. As from this date the building is shown as owned property. 
During 2003 has the Parliament bought the Konrad Adenauer building which has been held under a financial lease since 1986. Considering the age of the building has it been decided to apply a yearly depreciation rate of 10 % instead of the normally used 4 %. 
An advance payment of EUR 15.9 million was made on 31 December 2003 for the Atrium II building in Brussels. In March 2004 the Parliament signed a purchase contract which stipulates the value of the complex to EUR 18.2 million. 
The Court of Auditors has transferred EUR 29 million from the heading "Fixed assets under construction and advances in respect of tangible fixed assets" to this heading during 2004. This relates to the extension of the Court's building that was put into service during the year. 
B. C. D. Plant, machinery and tools 
Furniture and vehicles 
Computer hardware 
For approximately 20 % of the Delegations, there is no information about tangible fixed assets at 31 December 2004. An initiative is underway since January 2003 to improve the quality and exhaustiveness of information provided by Delegations and this, as well as a specific inventories project in 2004, should help to resolve this problem in the future. The total amount of tangible fixed assets included for the Delegations at 31 December 2004 is EUR 63.1 million. 
E. Finance leases and similar entitlements 
The criterion for the classification of property covered by leases as fixed assets is based on the extent to which the risks and rewards incident to ownership of the leased asset lie with the lessor or the lessee and depends on the transaction rather than the form of the contract. [1] 
Assets covered by a finance lease which does not transfer substantially the risks and rewards incident to their ownership to the lessee and assets covered by a lease of over five years are entered in the off-balance-sheet commitments annex to the financial statements. 
A correction was made to the closing balance at 31 December 2003 in relation to certain Commission buildings held under finance leases. This was required as it had been observed that the method of calculation of the asset value and outstanding liability relating to these leases had included an estimated fixed indexation of lease payments, not allowable under the accounting rules. The result had been that, at 31 December 2003, the asset values for these buildings had been overstated by EUR 188 million, the total finance lease liabilities had been overstated by EUR 254 million and the accumulated depreciation overstated by EUR 23 million. The net overstatement of liabilities was thus EUR 89 million and this correction has been made to the results carried forward from 2003. 
As shown in the "Tangible fixed assets" table below, the acquisition value at year-end is EUR 2,131.1 million. The table concerning charges still to be paid in respect of finance leases and similar entitlements below gives the details: the total is made up of EUR 2,130.8 million "Land and buildings", EUR 0.1 million "Plant, machinery and tools", and EUR 0.2 million "Furniture and vehicles". 
The Berlaymont building is included in the balance sheet of the Commission at 31 December 2004 since the long term lease contract (27 years) was signed during 2004 and the building was taken into service. The amount entered as the acquisition value, EUR 553 million, is the value of the building before renovation (EUR 50 million) plus an amount (EUR 503 million) covering the cost of the renovation work and all other costs. 
The main building occupied by the Publications Office is not included in the balance sheet but in the "Off-balance-sheet commitments — contingent liabilities" annex to the financial statements. Although the Office has two purchase options (in 2006 and in 2010) with values based on the market value, it is not considered that the risks and rewards incident to ownership of the asset are substantially transferred to the Office. The classification will be reviewed in 2006, when the first purchase option may be taken up. 
In March 1994 the European Parliament signed a long-term leasing contract with a purchase option for a complex in Strasbourg. In accordance with Commission Regulation No 2909/2000 of 29 December 2000 on the management in the accounts of the non-financial fixed assets of the European Institutions (OJ L 336, 30.12.2000 p. 75), this complex was up to 31 December 2003 shown in the balance sheet under "finance leases and similar entitlements". However, in December 2003 the Parliament invoked its purchase option for this building and the purchase agreement was signed in February 2004. Thus at 31 December 2004, the building is now shown under the heading "land and buildings." 
The Economic and Social Committee (ESC) and the Committee of the Regions (CoR) have entered the finance leasing contracts for their Belliard and Montoyer buildings on the assets side of the balance-sheet. They are co-financed on the following scale: 
2001 | ESC: 70 % | CoR: 30 % | 
2002 | ESC: 67,7 % | CoR: 32,3 % | 
from 2003 | ESC: 67 % | CoR: 33 % | 
A new 27 year lease was signed for the ESC's and CoR's Belliard building during 2004 for a value of EUR 30.8 million. Completed renovation work on another Belliard building to the value of EUR 25.9 million has also been added under the heading long-term leasing 
On 12 May 2004, the ESC and the CoR jointly signed a 27 year finance lease contract with total lease payments of EUR 22.1 million, commencing 1 February 2005 for another new building in Brussels. 
F. Other tangible fixed assets 
The Council has an operational lease for a building in Brussels. Alteration work on this building in 2004 totalling EUR 3.3 million was included under this heading at year-end. Further alteration work to a value of EUR 1.7 million, done in 2004 on the Council's New York office, has also been entered under this heading 
G. Fixed assets under construction and advances in respect of tangible fixed assets 
In October 2004 the Parliament signed a long-term leasing contract with a purchase option for a new complex in Brussels, for which construction started in 2004. At the date of the signature of the lease contract a down payment of EUR 40 million was made. 
On 26 March 2003 the Council signed a convention for the construction of a building in Brussels and the finance lease covering this building. The estimated cost is EUR 233 million (including land) and an advance of EUR 51 million was paid in 2004 (2003: EUR 8.5 million) and included under this heading. Payments for supplementary construction on the building have also been included here, for a value of EUR 4 million.

IV. FINANCIAL FIXED ASSETS 
This heading covers investments made with a view to establishing permanent links and/or seen as supporting the activities of the European Communities. It also includes permanent guarantees and advances granted and the net assets of the Guarantee Fund. A distinction should be drawn between guarantees granted by the European Communities to third parties and the Guarantee Fund, which is designed to cover risks associated with loans granted to non-member countries. 
A. Investments in related organisations 
— European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) subscription 
The EBRD was given initial capital of EUR 10 billion, of which 3 % was subscribed by the Communities. The proportion of this capital called up is 30 %. 
On 15 April 1996, at their annual meeting, the Bank's governors decided to double the amount of authorised capital. Under this decision, the Communities have subscribed for 30,000 additional shares with a face value of EUR 10,000 each. This operation involves called-in shares and callable shares in the following proportions: 22.5 % of the subscribed shares represent the number of called-in shares and the remainder will be callable shares. 
This item covers the full amount of the Communities' subscription (EUR 157.5 million) to the EBRD's capital which has been called up and partially paid (EUR 139 million). Payments outstanding on the proportion of capital called up of EUR 18.5 million are recorded under short-term liabilities (EUR 8.4 million) and long-term liabilities (EUR 10.1 million). Payments outstanding on non-called up capital amount to EUR 442.5 million and are included as contingent liabilities in the off balance sheet. 
The 3 % shareholding in the EBRD is valued at cost, as it represents a financial instrument under IPSAS 15 and IAS 39. 
— European Investment Fund (EIF) subscription 
The EIF is the European Union's financial institution specialising in risk capital and guarantees to SMEs. Under the Council Decision of 6 June 1994 the European Communities, represented by the Commission, subscribed for a total of ECU 600 million to the EIF's capital. This represents 30 % of the EIF's capital. The Commission has paid all the called-up capital, which amounts to 20 %. 
Under an agreement between the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed in 2000, the European Communities have a "put option" on its shares in the EIF. On 30 June 2005 the Commission will be entitled to sell its shares at a unit price of EUR 315,000, which is 57.5 % above the purchase price. The Commission is currently negotiating a new put option with the EIF. 
Payments outstanding on non-called up capital (80 %) amount to EUR 480 million and are included as contingent liabilities in the off balance sheet. 
The equity method is used to value the Communities' share in the EIF, in accordance with IPSAS 7. Under the equity method the shareholding is initially recorded at cost and is then adjusted to take into account changes subsequent to the investor's acquisition of a share of the net assets of the controlled entity. The result of adjustments reflects the investor's share of the results of the controlled entity. 
Under the equity method, the shareholding is valued at 30 % of the EIF's own capital. The EIF's balance sheet for 2004 shows a total of EUR 586.6 million of own capital, including profits of EUR 27.2 million for the year. The Communities' share is 30 % of this amount (EUR 176 million), of which EUR 8.2 million concerns the result for 2004. A dividend of EUR 2.4 million relating to the financial year 2003 was received in 2004. 
— Galileo Programme 
For the implementation of the development phase of the Galileo programme, a joint undertaking, within the meaning of Article 171 of the Treaty, was set-up by the Council Regulation 876/2002 for a period of 4 years (2002 to 2006.) The aim of this legal entity is to ensure the unity of the administration and the financial control of the Galileo programme for its development, and to this end to mobilise the funds assigned to that programme. The founding members are the European Communities, represented by the Commission, and the European Space Agency (ESA). The Commission, through grants given under the trans-European networks (TEN) budget, makes available to the Galileo undertaking the requested funds to co-finance the related activities of the development phase. 
The Communities have subscribed for EUR 520 million of the capital of this entity and at 31 December 2004 EUR 282 million had been paid, with the balance, EUR 238 million uncalled. 
As with the EIF, it is accounted for using the equity method of consolidation. For 2004 the Communities' share of the loss of the joint undertaking was EUR 143.6 million. Thus the value of the investment at 31 December 2004 was EUR 89.3 million being the investment of EUR 282 million less the accumulated share of the losses, EUR 192.7. In 2003 the interest earned by Galileo on Communities' funds received was treated as a further contribution of the Communities — in 2004 this was corrected so that such interest was accounted for as income of the Galileo joint venture. 
B. Other financial fixed assets 
B.1. Subscriptions and participations 
This heading includes subscriptions and participations purchased to help beneficiaries develop their business activities. 
— ECIP programme 
This heading covers Communities' contributions to the provision of equity and subordinated loan capital for joint ventures set up under the European Community Investment Partners Programme (ECIP). The ECIP programme was halted early, the only extension being its winding-up. The programme cannot be definitively wound up until the last joint venture has been completed. Most of the operations have already been wound up, recovered or converted into definitive grants and work on the remaining open files is ongoing. 
A review of open files is currently ongoing to assess the recoverability and thus value of the investments. It has been observed that many of the amounts previously shown as participations do not fully meet the criteria to be treated as such. In most cases the amounts forwarded to beneficiaries were in fact interest-free advances. Although it has been difficult to calculate reliably the real value of ECIP equity contributions, in particular due to the geographical disbursal of the beneficiaries, because of the ongoing work this year the Commission has more information available and so did not need to apply a 100 % write down as in previous years. 
— Eurotech Capital, Venture Consort and JOP 
The purpose of the Eurotech Capital instrument is to encourage the private funding of trans-national high-technology projects developed by small and medium-sized undertakings through a network of risk-capital investors. It covers payments made since 1990 in the form of pre-financing repayable under certain circumstances when contracts run out. The Communities' contributions do not constitute equity stakes in the relevant venture capital companies. Rather they represent a fixed proportion of certain investments of these venture capital companies in third companies. These contributions are reimbursable according to conditions specified in the contracts between the Communities and these venture capital companies. Amounts that are held by the venture capital companies (EUR 0.8 million) are shown under "Sundry Debtors," see VII.B.4 ("Receivables due on certain programmes"). 
The purpose of the Venture Consort instrument is to promote the trans-national syndication of risk-capital operators in small and medium-sized enterprises. It covers contributions since 1985 for investments in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) engaging in innovatory projects. 
The purpose of the Phare-Tacis Joint Venture programme (JOP) is to foster the creation and development of joint ventures in the countries of Central/Eastern Europe and former Soviet states. 
Since all three are risk capital operations, and even if some amounts may be reimbursed, it is very difficult to assess the real present value of the contributions. In accordance with the principle of prudence, a 100 % write down has been made for the value of these contributions, which are therefore entered in the balance sheet at zero. 
— Other financial instruments 
The "SME Finance Facility/SME financing mechanism" under the trusteeship of the EBRD is designed to encourage investment funds to grow and to retain over the long term the capital investments they make in SMEs in the Phare candidate countries. The programme is financed jointly by the Commission budget, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), in association with the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the European Investment Bank (EIB). 
The "Growth &amp; Employment — ETF Start up facility" (1998-2000 programme) and "MAP Equity — ETF Start up facility" (2001-2005 programme), under the trusteeship of the EIF support the creation and financing of start-up SMEs by investing in suitable specialised venture capital funds. 
The participation in Eurotunnel is held by the ECSC in liquidation. 
B.2. Other securities 
This heading comprises two GBP commercial papers issued by the EIB and held by the ECSC in liquidation to hedge the payments to be made on GBP borrowings of the same amounts. The papers have settlement dates of 2017 and 2019 respectively.

Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2728/94 of 31 October 1994 set up a Guarantee Fund for external actions to repay the Communities' creditors in the event of default by beneficiaries of loans granted or guaranteed by the Communities. 
This facility covers loans guaranteed by the Communities as a result of a Council Decision, in particular European Investment Bank (EIB) lending operations outside the European Union and loans under macro-financial assistance (MFA loans) and Euratom loans outside the European Union. 
In accordance with Article 6 of the Regulation the Commission entrusted financial management of the Fund to the EIB under an agreement signed between the Communities and the EIB on 23 November 1994 in Brussels and on 25 November 1994 in Luxembourg. 
Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2728/94 on the Guarantee Fund, as amended by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1149/1999 of 25 May states that with effect from 1 January 2000 the Fund is endowed by payments from the general budget equivalent to 9 % of the capital value of the operations. The same Regulation sets the target amount at 9 %. In accordance with the Regulation, "if, at the end of a year, the target amount is exceeded, the surplus shall be paid back to a special heading in the statement of revenue in the general budget of the European Communities". 
The Inter-institutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure provided that the general budget of the European Communities should include a guarantee reserve to cover loans to third countries. This reserve is intended to cover the requirements of the Guarantee Fund and, where necessary, activated guarantees exceeding the amount available in the Fund, so that these amounts may be charged to the budget. 
The Fund is endowed by payments from the Communities' budget, the proceeds from interest on investments made from the Fund's assets, and sums recovered from defaulting debtors for whom the Fund has had to activate its guarantee. 
The entry on the assets side of the Commission's balance sheet of EUR 1,612 million (2003: EUR 1,592 million) represents the Fund's net assets at 31 December 2004. Since the Fund may be called on to cover defaulting debtors at any time, a provision has been created for risks and charges in line with the principle of prudence. This provision of EUR 1,086 million (2003: EUR 1,369 million) corresponds to the target amount [2] for the Guarantee Fund calculated on the basis of the amount outstanding at 31 December 2004. The difference between the amount of the Fund shown on the assets side and the amount of the provision corresponds to the surplus to be repaid to the budget, EUR 526 million i.e. EUR 187 million (2003: EUR 223 million) plus an exceptional surplus of EUR 339 million; it is entered under own capital. The exceptional surplus is due to a reduction in the target amount following the accession of the ten new Member States in 2004 (Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No. 2273/2004).

This item principally covers risk capital loans on special terms granted as part of cooperation with non-member countries. It also covers loans granted under the ECIP programme to promote the setting-up of investment joint ventures in Asia, Latin America, the Mediterranean region and South Africa. 
The ECIP programme was halted early, the only extension being its winding-up. The programme cannot be definitively wound up until the last joint venture has been completed. Most of the operations have already been wound up, recovered or converted into definitive grants and work on the remaining open files is ongoing. As part of this review of files it has been observed that many of the amounts previously shown as loans do not fully meet the criteria to be treated as such. In most cases the amounts forwarded to beneficiaries were in fact interest-free advances. As mentioned above for the ECIP equity contributions, it has similarly been difficult to calculate reliably the real value of ECIP loans, but again due to the ongoing work, this year the Commission has more information available and so did not need to apply a 100 % write down as in previous years.

Under the EC Treaty, the Council, acting unanimously, has the power to adopt guarantee or borrowing programmes if it considers this necessary to attain the objectives of the Communities. Communities borrowings are direct commitments by the Communities itself and not by any individual Member State.

1. Communities' pensions 
Under Article 83 of the Staff Regulations, benefits paid under the pension scheme are charged to the budget of the Communities. Officials contribute one third towards the long-term financing of the scheme by means of a compulsory levy. Member States jointly guarantee payment of such benefits in accordance with the scale laid down for financing such expenditure (first subparagraph of paragraph 1). For this reason a receivable from the Member States is shown on the balance sheet. Due to the latest actuarial valuation of the scheme, at 31 December 2004 the receivable has risen to EUR 25.8 billion (from EUR 22.8 billion in 2003) to reflect the increase in the scheme's estimated liabilities. The receivable also covers the pension obligations in relation to members and former members of the Commission, and this year for the first time pension obligations in relation to members and former members of the Court of Auditors as well as judges and former judges of the Court of Justice. 
Thus, the method applied in 2004 to account for Communities' pensions is the same as in 2003: a provision on the liabilities side to cover the debt, and an entry on the assets side to reflect the undertaking given by Member States to the Communities to pay Communities' pensions. As there is no IPSAS available yet on this issue, the accounting rule concerning pensions adopted by the Commission's Accounting Officer as part of the modernisation of the accounting system also requires the same method to be applied. It will be adapted, if necessary, when an IPSAS on pensions is available. 
2. Other amounts 
This is primarily the financial contribution by the Belgian State to the purchase and fitting-out of the D3 building for the Parliament, which came to EUR 176 million and is to be paid over ten years ending in 2008. At year-end EUR 62 million is due greater than one year (2003: EUR 80.8 million), while a further EUR 21.2 million (2003: EUR 20.7 million) falls due within one year. Also included is an amount of EUR 66.2 million relating to social housing loans given by the ECSC in liquidation (2003: EUR 80.3 million). 
VI. STOCKS 
The stock of vaccines and antigens held at the Food and Veterinary Office of DG SANCO has a net book value of EUR 6.9 million. It was valued in accordance with the implementing rules for the Commission's accounting and consolidation manual (valuation at most recent acquisition price). 
Apart from the above, the heading mainly covers the scientific and technical equipment of the Joint Research Centre. Write-downs totalling EUR 22.1 million (2003: EUR 41.8 million) were made in respect of the Joint Research Centre in Geel in accordance with the rules in the Commission's accounting and consolidation manual. 
The stock of publications held by the Publications Office is valued at zero following an analysis made in 2001. This relates to publications stock held and/or managed by the Office for which a charge is made (paying stock). Publications to be distributed free of charge are not taken into account.

VII. SHORT-TERM ASSETS 
A. Long-term assets falling due in less than one year 
These amounts represent the portion of the long-term receivables that fall due during the following 12 months — see tables above for more details. 
B. Current assets 
B.1 Advances paid to Member States 
This amount represents an advance of EUR 0.5 million (2003: EUR 4.9 million) paid to a Member State in connection with the costs of eradication of certain animal diseases — see also Point 8, off-balance-sheet commitments. 
B.2 Amounts owed by Member States 
a. EAGGF Guarantee receivables: This item covers: 
- the amounts owed by beneficiaries of EAGGF Guarantee (EUR 1,560.9 million) as declared and certified by the Member States and entered in the debtors ledger at the end of the year ( 15 October 2004) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2761/99 less 20 % of the amount, which the Member States are allowed to retain to cover administrative costs. The Member States are not required to make the amounts available to the Commission unless they are recovered. The above figure does not include the EUR 5 million (2003: EUR 64.5 million) declared by the Member States as irrecoverable. This amount represents claims which paying agencies have had to abandon or are statutorily unable to recover. 
- In accordance with the principle of prudence, the European Communities must estimate and record the part of the EAGGF Guarantee that is unlikely to be recovered. The declared estimate of the write-down is EUR 895.4 million (as estimated by the Member States), which accounts for 57.4 % of the total amount to be recovered at 31 December 2004 (53.2 % at 31 December 2003.) The Commission relies on the estimates of the Member States based on the assumption that the paying agencies are in a better position to assess the amounts likely to be recovered. The findings of the certifying bodies concerning management of amounts owed are handled under the 2004 clearance procedure, including any proposal for the application of financial corrections. The fact that this adjustment is entered in the accounts does not mean that the EC is waiving future recovery of the amounts covered by the write-down.

Total | 2555,28 | 2148,69 | 
b. VAT paid by Institutions and recoverable from the Member States: this item covers the amounts due in respect of taxes paid by the Institutions and recoverable from the Member States (EUR 19 million). A specific write-down of EUR 1.7 million has been calculated. 
c. Own resources: The separate account contains traditional own resources of EUR 1,905 million (less 25 % [5] equals EUR 1,428.8 million) which, under Article 6(3)(b) of Regulation No 1150/2000, have been established by the Member States but not made available to the Communities as they have not yet been recovered or guaranteed, or because they have been challenged. Each Member State sends the Commission a quarterly statement of these accounts, with the following particulars for each type of resource: 
- the previous quarter's outstanding balance, 
- the amounts recovered during the quarter in question, 
- rectifications of the base (corrections/cancellations) during the quarter in question, 
- amounts written off, 
- balance to be recovered at the end of the quarter in question. 
When the traditional own resources from the separate account are recovered, they must be entered in the Commission's account with the treasury or the body appointed at the latest on the first working day following the 19th day of the second month following the month during which the entitlement was recovered. 
This figure of EUR 1,905 million overestimates the Communities' actual entitlements since the separate account for traditional own resources largely consists of amounts where actual recovery is unlikely. 
For the previous years the Commission calculated a write-down of the entitlements in the separate accounts by using a statistical method. For 2004 and onwards this write-down is based on estimations made by Member States themselves. In order to ensure that the separate account provides a better picture of the actual budgetary situation Article 6(4)(b) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 was amended by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2028/2004 of 16 November 2004. This Article states now; "Together with the final quarterly statement for a given year, Member States shall forward an estimate of the total amount of entitlements contained in the separate account at 31 December of that year for which recovery has become unlikely." 
Based on the estimations sent by Member States, a write-down of EUR 689.4 million has been deducted from the item for receivables from Member States on the assets side of the balance sheet — for information, the statistical method produces a similar amount. However, this does not mean that the Commission is waiving recovery of the amounts covered by the value adjustment. Even when recovery looks very unlikely, if not virtually impossible, this does not necessarily mean that the amounts in question are lost to the Community budget as traditional own resources. This is because non-recovered entitlements are lost only if the Member State has exhausted all the avenues it is required to pursue in order to secure recovery. Where the Member State fails to do this, it is held financially liable and required to pay he amount into the Community budget in accordance with Article 17(2) of Regulation No 1150/2000. 
The breakdown by Member State of A account and separate account receivables in respect of own resources is as follows:

The own resources to be regularised at 31 December 2004 arise mainly due to Amending Budget No. 10/2004 adopted in December but paid by most Member States on the first working day of January, as well as certain VAT amounts. 
d. Other receivables from Member States: The figure of EUR 520.6 million comprises late-payment interest of EUR 46.7 million and other receivables of EUR 474 million. One reason for the significant increase from prior years is due to the work done on the modernisation of the accounting systems project; the Commission can now better track the recovery orders issued to individual debtors, including Member States. As this was not possible last year, such amounts due from Member States were primarily included under the "Other Recovery Orders" figure in Sundry Debtors. Also included in 2004 is an amount of EUR 170 million relating to contributions due from the new Member States to the Research Fund for Coal &amp; Steel. 
B.3 Amounts owed by non-consolidated Communities bodies 
This heading contains various amounts owed to the European Communities by Communities' bodies not covered by the scope of consolidation, for which the Institutions pay certain expenditure, which will subsequently be repaid, totalling EUR 28.9 million (2003: EUR 29.3 million).

This item covers receivables arising from the activities of the European Communities. 
1. Unpaid fines imposed by the Commission for infringements of competition rules EUR 1,741.7 million (2003: EUR 1,755.3 million.) The changes in the figures for the Commission's outstanding fines are as follows (EUR million):

1811,0 | 873,5 | – 190,0 | – 290,9 | – 413,4 | 1790,2 | 
After the decision to impose a fine, the debtors have two months from the date of notification: 
- either to accept the decision, in which case they must pay the fine within the time limit laid down and the amount is definitively collected by the Commission; 
- or not to accept the decision, in which case they lodge an appeal under Communities' law. However, the principal of the fine must be paid within the time limit laid down as the appeal does not have suspensory effect (Article 242 of the EC Treaty). In such cases, debtors have two options: they can present a bank guarantee or pay the fine provisionally. 
In respect of imposed fines outstanding at 31.12.2004, a total of EUR 2,021 million was collected provisionally. These payments are applied against the related receivable and included under disposable assets, but EUR 1,933 million of the amount relating to cases where an appeal is made or it is not known if an appeal will be made is also treated as contingent liabilities [6], since the case is still pending the final judgment. In addition, at 31.12.2004 bank guarantees had been presented for a total of EUR 1,165.8 million. These guarantees do not affect the amount of receivables on the assets side of the balance sheet, but are entered in the annex as off-balance-sheet commitments under contingent assets. The amount shown in the off-balance-sheet commitments as potential liabilities totals EUR 3,837.9 million, being the total outstanding claims pending judgement plus interest earned on payments received pending final judgement. 
2. Amounts paid to financial intermediaries but not yet transferred to the final beneficiary. This item includes advance payments from the budget to public or private intermediaries selected by the Commission to carry out the management or forward these payments to the final beneficiaries, either because of provisions contained in the regulations or as a result of contractual provisions. This amount, which totals EUR 1,313.6 million, represents funds held by intermediaries at 31 December 2004 (2003: EUR 1,007.5 million.) The split of these amounts by budget-line is given below. The bank interest generated by these amounts is also included, being EUR 19.6 million (2003: EUR 43.6 million.)

The issue of pre-financing operations and the integrated accounting and clearance arrangements for them has been addressed as part of the Commission's accounting modernisation project. As part of this project to move to full accrual accounting, the Accounting Officer has laid down accounting rules for the inclusion of pre-financing on the assets side of the balance sheet on the basis of Article 3(5) of the Regulation laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the Financial Regulation. These rules came into force on 1 January 2005 and so the opening balance sheet of the European Communities at this date will show outstanding pre-financing payments as assets. During 2004, a significant effort was made by the Commission's services to inventory all outstanding pre-financing amounts. The balance sheet at 31 December 2004 however, as with previous years, is not prepared under these new rules and so does not include such amounts as assets. 
3. Certain financial instruments are managed on trust by third-party bodies, such as the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Investment Fund (EIF), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) and EUROFER. The amount held by these bodies in trust accounts at 31 December 2004 totals EUR 534.7 million, not including write-down (2003: EUR 300.9 million.) The split of these amounts by budget-line is given below. This figure does not include investments in risk capital funds by these instruments, which are shown under "Other investments" (Assets IV.B.1).

4. The EFTA financial mechanism was introduced in 1993 to support the development and structural adjustment of certain regions of the European Union. The contributors, including the Commission, are joint owners of the funds available. The Commission's share at 31 December 2004 is EUR 36.3 million (2003: EUR 44.5 million.) 
5. These amounts primarily relate to advances granted under both the ECIP (EUR 51.5 million) and MEDIA (EUR 41.7 million) programmes. Using the prudence principle and based on the risks and uncertainty involved, a value reduction of EUR 29.6 million is made for the ECIP balances and EUR 28.1 million for the MEDIA amounts. A review of the open files is ongoing so as to determine the status of all such advances so as to determine the final amounts to be refunded to the Commission. When a file is closed and a receivable is due, a recovery order is made and the balance will be transferred to recovery orders. 
6. In 2004 two additional calls were made on the Guarantee Fund relating to a debt in Argentina. The debt in question thus became a debt of the Guarantee Fund, but was subsequently repaid. The amount outstanding at 31 December 2004 relates to late payment interest and penalties due. Given the nature and circumstances surrounding this receivable a write down of 100 % was considered prudent. 
7. These are recovery orders entered in the accounts at 31 December 2004 as established entitlements to be recovered and not already included under other headings on the assets side of the balance sheet. 
A value adjustment has been entered for irrecoverable entitlements still to be determined. Entitlements due for more than one year are written down by 20 %. A further cut of 20 % is made for each additional year. This overall write-down is calculated on the amount of the entitlements outstanding at the end of the year. Certain entitlements, such as entitlements for which an individual write-down is made, are not included in the flat-rate write-down. 
Also included under this heading are fines issued by the ECSC in liquidation — however, the amount at 31 December 2004 and 2003, EUR 23.6 million and EUR 32.5 million respectively, are fully written down due to their age and doubts about their recoverability. Note also that the accounting treatment of fines differs for the ECSC in liquidation — whereas the Commission recognises a receivable and a revenue once it imposes a fine, the ECSC in liquidation does not recognise a revenue until the amount has been paid without appeal — until settlement a provision is maintained for appealed amounts. 
8. Interest to be received and charges paid in advance are included under this heading. 
9. As the payment appropriations carried over are already contained in the result for the year, only the expenditure to be charged to non-differentiated appropriations are included in this item.

The budget outturn is EUR 2,736.7 million and is set out in detail in the budget outturn 2004 table. 
Exchange differences included in the economic outturn are the result of payments and financial assets in currencies other than the euro, in particular those of the Member States which have not yet adopted the euro. 
As regards financial assets, the value in euros of the national currencies varies each day in line with the market exchange rates. Financial assets are revalued for the purposes of the balance sheet at the exchange rates on 31 December. 
The Commission enters payments at the monthly rates which are inevitably different from the market rates.

C. Reserves 
1. The revaluation reserve comprises the revaluations of tangible and intangible fixed assets. The balance at year-end relates entirely to revaluations made on Commission buildings prior to 2003. 
2. The reserve for borrowing and lending activities comprises a special reserve set up in previous years to cover future liabilities resulting from borrowing and lending activities.

3. The reserves relating to the ECSC in liquidation are made up of five separate reserves: a special reserve, a pension reserve, a reserve for the Research Fund for Coal &amp; Steel, a general reserve and uncalled amounts from new Member States. The increase is due mainly to the allocation from the result from 2003 of EUR 337.9 million to the research fund and the inclusion this year of the uncalled amounts from new Member States of EUR 170 million.

Guarantee Fund 
Since the Fund may be called on to cover defaulting debtors at any time, a provision has been created for risks and charges in line with the principle of prudence. This provision of EUR 1,086 million (2003: EUR 1,369 million) corresponds to the target amount [7] for the Guarantee Fund calculated on the basis of the amount of loans outstanding at 31 December 2004. The difference between the amount of the Fund shown on the assets side and the amount of the provision corresponds to the surplus to be repaid to the budget i.e. EUR 526 million (2003: EUR 223 million), which is entered under own capital. 
Decommissioning of JRC nuclear facilities 
In 2002 a consortium of independent experts conducted a study into the estimated costs of the decommissioning of the JRC nuclear facilities and waste management programme. Their estimate of EUR 1,145 million (including EUR 76 million as an estimate of the cost required for the "green field" option, i.e. total destruction of all the buildings) is taken as the basis for the provision to be included in the accounts. To fully apply IPSAS rules, this provision is indexed for inflation (at a rate of 2.5 %) and then discounted to its net present value (at 5 %). At 31 December 2004, this results in an amount for the provision of EUR 871.4 million, less the costs incurred to date of EUR 60.2 million, giving EUR 811.2 million. 
In view of the estimated duration of this programme (around 30 years), it should be pointed out that there is some uncertainty about this estimate, and the final cost could be different from the amounts currently entered. 
Pensions 
At 31 December 2004, the rules concerning the Communities' pension scheme are defined by the new version of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities (in force from 1st May 2004). The rules regarding the staff pensions are directly applicable in all Member States. The arrangement covers the various types of pensions (seniority, disability, survival) and the invalidity allowance. 
In accordance with article 83 of the Staff Regulations, the payment of the benefits provided for in the pension scheme constitutes a charge to the Communities' budget. Member States guarantee the payment of these benefits collectively according to the scale fixed for the financing of this expenditure. In addition, officials contribute one third to the long-term financing of this scheme via a compulsory contribution. 
Until last year, the provision in respect of the estimated amount of pension rights had been based on the applicable rules complying with the former Staff Regulations. This year, for the first time and as mentioned above, the base was the new Staff Regulations of officials in force from 1st May 2004 (including in particular reform of the Communities' pension scheme). 
The liabilities under the Communities' pension scheme were the subject to an actuarial valuation by independent experts on 31 December 2004 on the basis of the applicable rules of the new statute. This evaluation covered the benefits connected with seniority, disability and survival (different types of pension as well as invalidity allowance). It was carried out in accordance with the methodology of IAS 19. This accounting standard requires the employer to determine his actuarial commitment on an ongoing basis, taking into account both the promised benefits during the active lifetime of employees, and foreseeable increases in salaries. 
The actuarial valuation method used to calculate this liability is known as the projected unit credit method (or accumulated entitlements method). The principal actuarial hypotheses used in the valuation were: 
1. The life table (EU 2004) was made on the basis of the national tables of the officials' countries of origin, and was corrected to take account of actual observed mortality rates; 
2. The invalidity table (EU 2004) was based on the one used by the Coordinated Organisations (OECD, NATO, ESA, etc) and corrected with the observation of the population of EU officials; 
3. The nominal discount rate was based on the zero coupon euro yield curve in December 2004 for a duration close to that of the scheme (19 years), being 4.3 %; on the other hand, the inflation was based on the annual rate of change of the HICP in December 2004, being 2.4 %; so the used real discount rate was 1.9 %; 
4. The general revaluation rate of the salaries and benefits was based on revaluation statistics of the period 1993-2004, being equal to 0.2 %; 
5. The individual salary increase beyond the rate of the general revaluation was estimated on the basis of the new career structure (promotion rates specified in annex I of the Staff Regulations) and its transitional measures (section 1 of annex XIII of the Staff Regulations); it varies with the age and the grade and step of the official; 
6. The matrimoniality coefficients for active officials at the time of their departure on retirement were based on statistics of the population of officials and equal to 90 % for men and 60 % for women; 
7. The actual marriage situation was taken for former officials (pensioners and invalids); 
8. The departure on retirement was supposed to occur at the time when the official benefits from his full rights, taking into account the reduction for early retirement and the Barcelona Incentive for late retirement, at the latest at 65 years. 
Concerning the data, the same population groups as for the actuarial valuation on 31 December 2003 were used. So, liabilities cover the rights previously defined for the following persons: 
1. Staff in active employment at 31 December 2004 in all the Institutions and agencies included in the Communities' pension scheme; 
2. Invalids who receive an invalidity allowance according to Article 78 of the Staff Regulations 
3. Former officials and other servants benefiting of a retirement pension; 
4. Former officials and other servants benefiting of a disablement pension; 
5. The recipients of a survivor pension (widows or widowers, orphans, dependants). 
Comparison of 2004 and 2003 actuarial liability: The actuarial liability was valued at EUR 25.8 billion on 31 December 2004, while the previous valuation carried out for the situation on 31 December 2003, based on the rules of the former Staff Regulations, gave an amount of EUR 22.8 billion. 
The following facts explain the essential differences between the 2004 and 2003 actuarial evaluations: 
- Changes in some actuarial hypotheses, particularly concerning the real discount rate (2.6 % to 1.9 %). 
- The changes in the rules on careers and pensions introduced by the new Staff Regulations. 
- The changes in the population (from 45,447 members to 47,782), most of them being newly active officials who have an accrual rate of 1.9 % instead of 2 % according to the new Staff Regulations. 
The calculations of gross pensions and family allowances are based on the provisions of the Staff Regulations.

In addition to the EUR 25.8 billion concerning the staff pension scheme described above, the provision also covers the pension obligations in relation to members and former members of the Commission, and this year for the first time pension obligations in relation to members and former members of the Court of Auditors as well as judges and former judges of the Court of Justice. 
Other provisions 
The other provisions concern mainly an estimate of the Communities' contribution to the Emergency Fund for foot and mouth and other animal diseases of EUR 41.9 million relating to various Member States (2003: EUR 102.1 million) — see also Annex 4, Off-balance-sheet commitments, Point 8. 
Provisions of the ECSC in liquidation 
These provisions cover borrowings not covered by a guarantee from Member States EUR 209 million, a provision for bank costs of EUR 0.3 million, a provision for the Research Fund for Coal &amp; Steel of EUR 114.8 million and a provision for fines being appealed of EUR 3.9 million.

IV. SHORT-TERM LIABILITIES 
A. Long-term liabilities falling due in less than one year 
This heading includes borrowings which fall due for payment in less than one year's time, long-term leasing debts falling due within the year, subscriptions to EBRD capital and the purchase of Parliament's building complex (see table above).

This item includes amounts owed to EFTA countries, which includes the budget outturn figures of the current year, EUR 1.9 million, and the previous years and the balance on the EFTA current account. 
An amount of EUR 126.4 million (2003: EUR 23.2 million) to be paid to various Member States relating to claims made for reimbursement of certain costs in connection with the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 and other disease eradication costs, is also included under this heading. 
Under the "Other" sub-heading at 31 December 2004 the amounts relate to monies owed to Member States concerning a legal case won by the Commission. The comparative figure relates to two amending budgets in late 2003 that resulted in a reduction of EUR 4.9 billion in the Member States' own resources contributions, hence the payable at 31 December 2003. 
B. 2 Amounts due to non-consolidated Communities' bodies 
This item covers amounts totalling EUR 52.9 million owed by the Institutions to certain Communities' bodies which do not come within the scope of consolidation (2003: EUR 15.8 million). As mentioned earlier, the significant increase from last year is due to the work done on the modernisation of the accounting systems project and the improved identification of amounts due to individual creditors. 
B.3 Payment appropriations to be carried over 
In accordance with the Financial Regulation payment appropriations carried over to the following year are entered as budget expenditure. The contra-entry to these appropriations carried over and not yet used is to be found in the short-term liabilities in the balance sheet. 
It should be noted that this classification will no longer exist from 2005 onwards due to the introduction of the new accounting rules and the move to accrual accounting. This is because accrual accounting requires that charges be recognised in the period to which they relate, so such amounts must be charged in the following financial year(s), not the current. 
At 31 December 2004 the breakdown of payment appropriations to be carried over, taking all the Institutions together was as follows:

This item covers debts arising from the activities of the European Communities as well as non-budget recovery orders. 
This item includes revenue not booked, i.e. revenue that could not be definitively booked to the budget before the close of the year. Additionally it includes accrued interest on borrowings and swaps. 
C. Other liabilities 
These are mainly amounts owed to staff and revenue to be transferred to various organisations or other third parties. 
[1] This heading is based on standard IPSAS 13 - Leases. 
[2] The target amount corresponds to 9 % of the amount outstanding. 
[3] The write-off corresponds to commissions that the borrower does not have to repay. 
[4] In light of ongoing reviews of open files certain amounts have been transferred to "Sundry debtors" to better reflect their nature 
[5] Council Decision No 2000/597/EC, Euratom of 29 September 2000 on the system of the European Communities' own resources allows Member States to withhold 25 % of traditional own resources to cover the costs of collection.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET COMMITMENTS: Contingent assets and liabilities 
Contingent assets and liabilities are included in the annex to the financial statements as off-balance-sheet commitments. These include commitments made or received that could be of considerable budgetary significance in the medium or long term. Whether or not these commitments are confirmed will depend on the materialisation (or not) of one or more future events that are currently uncertain and not entirely under the control of the Communities. 
CONTINGENT ASSETS 
POINT 1: GUARANTEES RECEIVED 
1.1 Guarantees received under borrowing and lending activities 
The Commission has received guarantees from third-party guarantors in respect of guarantees it has granted on loans under its borrowing and lending activities. The guarantees received may be classified as follows: 
Guarantees received 
EUR | 
| 31.12.2004 | 31.12.2003 | 
Euratom: guarantees by third countries | 170000000 | 105000000 | 
NCI: Loans to Member States | 0 | 16316686 | 
Total | 170000000 | 121316686 | 
The Commission has not received third-party guarantees for loans granted under the financial assistance (MFA) scheme. However, these loans, totalling EUR 1,214 million, are guaranteed by the Guarantee Fund. 
1.2 Other guarantees received 
These are guarantees received by the Commission in connection with the operation of its various activities during the year, particularly concerning pre-financing payments made. Due to the work undertaken by the Commission services as part of the accounting modernisation project, a significant number of guarantees were recorded in the accounting system during 2004 in preparation for the opening balance sheet of 2005. The inclusion of this updated information is the reason for the large increase since 2003. These amounts have not yet been finalised and represent the Commission's best estimate at the present time — thus it is possible that the amount may need to be adjusted for the opening balance sheet of 2005. Also included are guarantees totalling EUR 97.2million (2003: EUR 112.2 million) received by the ECSC in liquidation and guarantees of EUR 3.6 million received by the Court of Auditors. 
1.3 Guarantees received in respect of fines' cases pending 
See balance sheet heading assets VII.B.4 and Point 4 under Contingent Liabilities for further details of the treatment of the amounts received in relation to fines issued. In summary, the recipient of a fine wishing to appeal can either provide a bank guarantee for the amount (and interest) in question or make a provisional payment. EUR 1,165.8 million of such bank guarantees were received at 31 December 2004 and are shown as contingent assets. 
POINT 2: SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED 
These are SWAPS entered into by the Commission and ECSC in liquidation outstanding at year-end. 
Swaps to be received

Total | 368616743 | 374437630 | 
POINT 3: NET CONTINGENT GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF AGRICULTURAL STOCKS 
The situation as regards stocks was established at 30 September 2004 and additional depreciation of these stocks was also calculated at this date. The expected selling prices for products from public stocks might change in line with the market situation. The situation update of market prices in February 2005 shows a contingent gain of EUR 198.3 million (2003: contingent gain of EUR 259.2 million) compared with the end of 2004.

POINT 4: FRAUD AND IRREGULARITIES — STRUCTURAL ACTIONS 
The table below is based on the formal reports submitted by the Member States in accordance with Commission Regulation No 1681/94, with amounts broken down by Member State. The table shows the difference between amounts identified by the Member States as still to be recovered (calculated on the basis of established entitlements or estimates) and amounts already recovered or declared irrecoverable.

TOTAL | 1102621 | 815363 | 
The figures given in this table represent a theoretical maximum rather than the amounts that will actually be made available to the Communities' budget, for the following reasons: 
- The Member States do not always report the results of their recovery operations (and certainly not promptly). 
- Although Member States must inform the Commission of the likelihood of recovery, it is impossible to determine exactly what proportion of the amounts still to be recovered will actually be recovered. National laws sometimes provide for a 30-year limitation period, which may well make the national authorities delay formally writing off the debt even if the chances of recovery are only theoretical. For structural operations, Member States must now send the Commission once a year a statement of the amounts awaiting recovery (Article 8 of Regulation No 438/2001) to give a better picture of the actual situation. 
- Even if the Member State concerned launches recovery proceedings in time, a positive outcome is not guaranteed. This is particularly true where recovery orders are contested in the courts. 
- Individual projects are co-financed as part of multi-annual programmes. As long as a multi-annual programme has not been closed, it is impossible to put an exact figure on the amounts to be recovered because the sums involved in irregularities may, in certain circumstances, be reallocated to other, legitimate projects and because payment by instalments, in particular final payments, can sometimes be used as a means of adjusting expenditure. The figures in these tables are provisional figures based on the reports received and processed up to the end of March 2005. These figures may therefore be changed in line with further reports arriving late. 
The prospects of recovery in individual cases cannot be assessed with sufficient accuracy from the information forwarded by the Member States. 
On the date when the consolidated statements on the implementation of the budget were drawn up, the annual report on the fight against fraud for 2004 had not yet been adopted. 
POINT 5: ESTIMATES OF AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE 
An estimate of the amount receivable is first to be made by the authorising officer responsible in respect of any measure or situation that may give rise to or modify an amount owing to the Communities. Estimates of amounts receivable are to specify the type of revenue and the budget item to which they are to be booked and, as far as possible, the particulars of the debtor and the estimated amount. Subject to Article 161(2) of the Financial Regulation, an estimate of amounts receivable does not generate commitment appropriations. The estimate of amounts receivable is regularised, when the recovery order is drawn up, i.e. when the entitlement is certain, of a fixed amount and due. 
The table below shows the breakdown by Member State of the estimated number of cases booked as memorandum items in respect of own resources:

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
POINT 1: GUARANTEES GIVEN 
1.1. Loans granted by the European Investment Bank (EIB) to third countries from its own resources 
As formulated, the guarantee legally covers the loans signed by the EIB at 31 December 2004 (including loans granted to Member States before accession). However, the Communities' guarantee is limited to a percentage of the ceiling of the credit lines authorised: 65 %, 70 %, 75 % or 100 %. Where the ceiling is not reached, the Communities' guarantee covers the full amount. 
At 31 December 2004 the amount outstanding totalled EUR 13,900 million (2003: EUR 13,573 million) and this, therefore, is the maximum risk faced by the Communities. 
For loans covered by the Communities' budget guarantee, the EIB also obtains guarantees from third parties (States, public or private financial institutions); in these cases the Commission is a secondary guarantor. The Communities' budget guarantee covers only the political risk of guarantees provided under the title of "risk-sharing". The other risks are covered by the EIB should the primary guarantor not honour the undertakings given. 
For guarantees provided under the title of "non-risk sharing", all the risks are covered by the Communities' budget should the primary guarantor not honour its undertakings given. If the primary guarantor is a public authority these risks are confined as a rule to the political risk, but when the guarantees are provided by an institution or a private company, the Communities' budget might also have to cover the commercial risk. 
The loans granted by the EIB from its own resources to third countries and covered by the Communities' budget guarantee are as follows:

Total | 1880 | 10147 | 1873 | 13900 | 13573 | 
1.2. Guarantees signed by the European Investment Fund (EIF) 
At 31 December 2004 the EIF had signed guarantees and commitments in venture capital operations totalling EUR 3,147.3 million, however of this amount EUR 958.9 million relates to the portfolio of guarantee operations for projects related to the development of Trans-European Networks (TEN) that has been transferred to EIB (the relevant Agreement was signed with the EIB on December 7, 2000.) The EIB bears the risk of the transactions (with the EIF remaining the guaranteeing party under the relevant Guarantee Agreements) and in return is entitled to receive the related fees (utilisation fee + commitment fee) from the intermediaries. Excluding these amounts since the EIF bears no risk, the total guarantees given and commitments in venture capital operations by the EIF at 31 December 2004 is EUR 2,188.4 million; this represents a maximum potential risk of EUR 656.5 million for the European Communities, as the Communities contribute 30 % of the capital of the EIF. The total capital subscribed by the Communities is EUR 600 million, of which 20 % has been called up. 
As the EIF is consolidated using the equity method, the calculation of the maximum commitment from the Communities' budget takes account of not only the capital, but also the European Communities' share of the EIF's total own resources. The Communities' share of the EIF's own resources totals EUR 176 million (2003: EUR 170.2 million), see also note IV.A Assets. The capital not called up totals EUR 480 million. Thus, should all the guarantees be called in, the European Communities would have a liability of EUR 0.5 million (being share of guarantees outstanding EUR 656.5 million, less share of EIF own resources EUR 176 million, less share of uncalled capital EUR 480 million). At 31 December 2003 the same calculation produced a negative figure, so no contingent liability was shown. 
The proportion of the capital subscribed by the European Communities which has not been called up (80 %) is also included in the off-balance-sheet commitments as a contingent liability (Point 7). 
1.3. Guarantees in relation to financial activities 
The amount relates to guarantees given by the Communities relating to JOP Facility 3. The Communities' risk is capped at the amounts shown. 
POINT 2: SWAPS TO BE DELIVERED 
These are SWAPS entered into by the Commission and ECSC in liquidation outstanding at year-end.

POINT 3: EAGGF GUARANTEE 
3.1. Expenditure between 16 October 2004 and 31 December 2004 
In the case of the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, the payments are those affected by the Member States between 16 October 2003 and 15 October 2004, provided that the accounting officer was notified of the commitment and authorisation by 31 January 2005. Payments made by Member States between 16 October and 31 December 2004 are included in the off-balance-sheet commitments. 
3.2. Clearance of accounts 
Contingent liabilities towards the Member States connected with the clearance procedures. The determination of the final amount of the liability and the year in which it will be charged to the budget will depend on the length of the procedure before the Court of Justice. 
3.3 Contingent debt pending a judgement by the Court 
Contingent debt towards a Member State as part of a procedure lodged with the Court of Justice concerning correction of advances. 
3.4 Contingent debts in respect of judgements pending execution 
Contingent debts for which the Commission decision has not been taken by the date on which the accounts are closed and for which the compensation arrangements need to be agreed on between the parties concerned. 
POINT 4: FINES 
As the fines imposed by the Commission for infringement of competition rules are entered in the result for the financial year, it has been decided that both fines for which an appeal has been lodged [2] and those where it is unknown if an appeal will be made should be included as a contingent liability in the off-balance-sheet commitments pending a decision by the Court of Justice. This contingent liability will be maintained until a decision that acquires the authority of a final decision (see explanatory note to the balance sheet — assets VII b.4). 
Fines Outstanding

Total | 1165,8 | 1884,9 | 239,2 | 3289,9 | 48,1 | 384,1 | 3722,1 | 
This table shows the state of play with fines imposed by the Commission that were still pending a legal decision when the accounts were closed. Once notified, debtors who do not accept the Commission decision fining them are entitled to lodge an appeal with the Court of Justice. However, the principal of the fine has to be paid within the prescribed time limit, since under Article 242 of the EC Treaty appeals do not have suspensory effect. Debtors have two options: they can either provide a bank guarantee or make a provisional payment. 
Only once the final judgment is delivered, does the Accounting Officer either refund the full amount of the provisional payment plus the interest on the principal or irrevocably collect the amount of the fine, as fixed by the final judicial decision, refunding, if appropriate, the relevant portion of the provisional payment together with the related interest. 
Interest earned on provisional payments (EUR 115.8 million) is included in the result of adjustments for the year and also as a contingent liability to reflect the uncertainty of the amounts. 
POINT 5: OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS (RAL) 
Commitments against differentiated appropriations still outstanding at 31 December 2004 totalled EUR 108.8 billion, of which EUR 1,366 million is covered by carryovers of payment appropriations from 2004 to 2005. The latter already feature in the budget out turn for the year, so they are not included in the potential liabilities. The outstanding commitment total of EUR 107.5 billion is the maximum potential commitment. 
The overall amount of outstanding commitments has been growing over the last ten years, most of the increase being linked to the increase over the same period in commitment appropriations and corresponding to the deferred completion of the operations covered by the budget commitments. These normal outstanding commitments are the direct and legitimate consequence of the implementation of the Community budget. For 2004, the increase of commitments outstanding (before carry over) was 4.7 %, compared to a 5 % increase in 2003, mainly due to the gradual stabilisation of the situation for the Structural Funds in 2004. For the EU-15, the RAL amount was stabilised in 2004 and it increased for the EUR-10 by 4.6 billion, i.e. the approximate amount of the overall increase in the RAL. 
In Joint Declarations in 2002 and 2003, the Commission, Parliament and Council emphasised the need to contain the amounts still to be cleared and to eliminate "abnormal outstanding commitments" in the medium term. Potentially abnormal outstanding commitments were defined in these Declarations, by common agreement, as consisting of dormant commitments for which no payment had been made for the past two financial years and old commitments that have been in the budget for at least five financial years. 
The Commission presented, along with the preliminary draft budget for 2005, the successful results of its endeavours to examine all potentially abnormal RAL (PAR) cases by the end of 2003. As each new financial year will add cases becoming potentially abnormal RAL, the Commission has continued the monitoring of potentially abnormal RAL in 2004. 
The following table shows the potentially abnormal RAL in 2004. It should be emphasised that the remaining potentially abnormal RAL at the end of 2004 comprises, by and large, cases where the Commission has examined the RAL and justified the need to retain the outstanding commitments for future payments. 
EUR millions | 
| Structural Funds | Internal policies | External action | Other | Total |

—amounts retained after examination of commitments | 3853 | 626 | 1379 | 516 | 6374 | 
POINT 6: LEGAL COMMITMENTS WITHOUT A BUDGET COMMITMENT 
These contingent liabilities originated because the Commission decided to enter into legal commitments in respect of amounts that were not covered by commitment appropriations in the budget. 
Under the Inter-institutional Agreement and, more generally, the rules relating to the budget, the following expenditure must be recorded as off-balance-sheet commitments in view of the volume of financial commitments which arises: 
- The Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund represent expenditure targets and the whole allocation shown in the financial perspective is meant to be matched by decisions. As a result, contingent commitments are evaluated at a maximum (points 6.1 and 6.2). 
A second more binding level of commitment arises once there is a legal decision for each programme or project (see table below). 
- ISPA: In itself, the ISPA Regulation does not lead to off-balance-sheet commitments as it does not provide for an annual allocation or even a total allocation. This is determined each year by the budgetary authority in line with the financial perspective. The ceilings in heading 7 (pre-accession) are not expenditure targets and the Inter-institutional Agreement allows a degree of flexibility between the various pre-accession instruments. On the other hand, ISPA generates contingent liabilities in connection with the individual projects as they involve a number of annual tranches of which only the first is covered by a budget commitment when the decision is adopted (point 6.3). 
- The Temporary Rural Development Instrument (TRDI) for the new Member States is funded under the EAGGF-Guarantee and covers the period 2004 to 2006. It is financed under differentiated appropriations and annual commitments are automatically made each year on the basis of the Commission decision approving the programme. No additional annual decision is required. The Commission decision represents an expenditure target and the whole allocation is meant to be matched by decisions (point 6.4). 
- The commitments made under financial protocols with Mediterranean non-member countries: The amount included in point 6.5 is the difference between the total amount of the protocols signed and the amount of the budget commitments entered in the accounts. The increase in these contingent liabilities corresponds to decommitments in 2004. These Protocols are international treaties that cannot be wound up without the agreement of both parties, although the process of winding them up is on-going. 
- Commitments entered into with specified third parties for other operations under heading 4, external actions, relating to specific amounts over a fixed period (points 6.6 and 6.7). 
The other multi-annual programmes do not contain any commitments to be included under contingent liabilities: expenditure in future years is conditional on the annual decisions by the budgetary authority or changes in the rules concerned.

Contingent Liability | N/A | 100 | 
Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 876/2002 of 21 May 2002 the Commission's contribution to the Galileo joint venture is EUR 520 million. This commitment is for a period of four years ending on 20 May 2006. In 2003, EUR 2 million of interest earned on the Commission contribution was treated as an increase in its subscription, however this has been corrected so that the interest has now been taken as revenue of the Galileo joint undertaking itself. Commitments of EUR 138 million not yet paid are included in the RAL (above) and so deducted from the above uncalled amounts. 
POINT 8: EMERGENCY VETERINARY FUND 
This heading covers amounts for foot-and-mouth primarily, but also other disease eradication costs that may have to be borne by the Communities' budget. The amounts entered represent the maximum possible liability minus the amounts already entered as either provisions or debts. The significant reduction since last year-end is due primarily to the agreement of the final amount to be paid to the UK relating to the foot-and-mouth crisis of 2001. The amount due to be paid is included as a debt on the balance sheet as amounts due to Member States. 
POINT 9: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RELATING TO FINANCE LEASES 
An agreement was signed between the Commission, the Belgian State and S.A. Berlaymont 2002 on 13 November 2002. It fixed the maximum price the Commission would have to pay and a deadline for the building to be made available. In 2003, the amount entered as a contingent liability was the value of the building before renovation (EUR 49,578,705) and a fixed amount (EUR 503,300,502) covering the cost of the renovation work and all other costs. However, the building is now included on the balance sheet of the Communities at 31 December 2004, together with corresponding lease liability, since the long-term finance lease contract was signed during 2004. Thus no contingent liability need be recognised at this year-end. 
The outstanding contractual obligation relating to the construction of the Council's LEX-building (EUR 188.6 million) has been included as a contingent liability at year end 2004. As nothing had been originally included in 2003, the corresponding figure (EUR 224.5 million) has been retrospectively also shown under this heading. 
Also included here is a contingent liability of EUR 22.1 million relating to a lease agreement signed by the Committee of Regions and the Economic and Social Committee in 2004 for a building occupied by them in 2005. 
POINT 10: LONG-TERM LEASES 
10.1. Buildings 
This heading covers buildings occupied under a long-term leasing contract (with an initial term of five years or more) that do not meet the conditions for entry on the assets side of the balance sheet. The amounts indicated correspond to commitments still to be paid during the term of the contract, except for the Court of Justice's Palais building, which is occupied under an indefinite lease; here, the amount of EUR 2.3 million corresponds to the annual rent. 
The Council's figure for 2003 has retrospectively been modified as updated information has been provided. 
The total for rented buildings breaks down as follows: 
EUR millions | 
Institution | Amount | 
Parliament | 88,3 | 
Council | 177,5 | 
Commission | 951,1 | 
Court of Justice | 2,3 | 
Court of Auditors | 7,0 | 
Total | 1226,2 | 
In accordance with the framework contract relating to the construction of one or more extensions to the building of the Court of Auditors, signed on 15 December 1999, the Luxembourg State undertakes to grant the Court a building lease on the land for the first extension at the price of EUR 1 (one) for a period not exceeding 49 years. Any further building leases on other land needed for the other extensions must not exceed the expiry date of the building lease granted for the first extension. 
The Luxembourg State also undertakes to sell the land at any time at the market rate determined by a joint expert opinion. For its part, the Court undertakes to do all it can to purchase the land from the Luxembourg State. It will ask the budgetary authority for the necessary funds. 
POINT 11: AMOUNTS RELATED TO LEGAL CASES 
11.1 Actions for damages brought against the Commission 
This heading relates to three actions for damages currently being brought against the Commission: 
The first action was brought against it in June 2003 in relation to a ruling made by the Commission. The claim is for EUR 735 million. The Commission submitted its rejoinder in February 2005. 
In the second case an action for damages was brought in October 2003, also in relation to a ruling made by the Commission. The claim is for an amount of EUR 1,664 million. The Commission submitted its rejoinder in November 2004. 
Neither case is likely to be decided before sometime in 2006. It should be noted that in an action for damages under Article 288 EC the applicant must demonstrate a sufficiently serious breach by the institution of a rule of law intended to confer rights on individuals, real harm suffered by the applicant, and a direct causal link between the unlawful act and the harm. In both cases the Commission has vigorously denied any liability in damages. 
In the final case, in May 2004 the owner of a building in Brussels initiated a legal process in the Court of First Instance against the Commission in order to be compensated for a non-signature of a lease contract. The Commission has estimated the possible obligation to be EUR 27 million, which is thus treated as contingent liability. 
Also included at 31 December 2004 is an amount of EUR 4.9 million relating to a case involving the Council.
