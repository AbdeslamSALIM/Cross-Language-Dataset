ANNEX 
Point 3 of the Annex to Decision 2005/7/EC is replaced by the following: 
"3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula: 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
= 61,436 Ã¢&#x20AC;&#x201C; 0,815 X + 0,144 W 
Where: 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
= the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase, 
X = the thickness of back-fat (including rind) in millimetres, measured at 6 cm off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last rib, 
W = the thickness of muscle in millimetres measured at the same time and in the same place as X. 
The formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 55 and 120 kilograms."
