of 15 May 2002 
establishing the ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to textile products and amending Decision 1999/178/EC 
(notified under document number C(2002) 1844) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2002/371/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme(1), and in particular Articles 4 and 6(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 the Community eco-label may be awarded to a product possessing characteristics which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects. 
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that specific eco-label criteria are to be established according to product groups. 
(3) It also provides that the review of the eco-label criteria, as well as of the assessment and verification requirements related to the criteria, is to take place in due time before the end of the period of validity of the criteria specified for each product group. That review is to result in a proposal for prolongation, withdrawal or revision. 
(4) It is appropriate to revise the ecological criteria that were established by Commission Decision 1999/178/EC of 17 February 1999 establishing ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to textile products(2) in order to reflect the developments in the market. At the same time, the period of validity of that Decision as extended by Commission Decision 2001/831/EC(3) should be modified. 
(5) A new Commission Decision should be adopted establishing the specific ecological criteria for this product group, which will be valid for a period of five years. 
(6) It is appropriate that, for a limited period of not more than 12 months, both the new criteria established by this Decision and the criteria established by Decision 1999/178/EC should be valid concurrently, in order to allow sufficient time for companies, that have been awarded or that have applied for the award of the eco-label for their products prior to the date of application of this Decision to adapt those products to comply with the new criteria. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are based on the draft criteria developed by the European Union Eco-Labelling Board established under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1

ANNEX 
FRAMEWORK 
The aims of the criteria 
These criteria aim in particular at promoting the reduction of water pollution related to the key processes throughout the textile manufacturing chain, including fibre production, spinning, weaving, knitting, bleaching, dyeing and finishing. 
The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of textile products which have a lower environmental impact. 
Assessment and verification requirements 
The specific assessment and verification requirements are indicated within each criterion. 
Where the applicant is required to provide declarations, documentation, analyses test reports, or other evidence to show compliance with the criteria, it is understood that these may originate from the applicant and/or his supplier(s) and/or their supplier(s), et cetera, as appropriate. 
Where appropriate, test methods other than those indicated for each criterion may be used if their equivalence is accepted by the Competent Body assessing the application. 
The functional unit, to which inputs and outputs should be related, is 1 kg of textile product at normal conditions (65 % RH ± 2 % and 20 °C ± 2 °C; these norm conditions are specified in ISO 139 Textiles - standard atmospheres for conditioning and testing). 
Where appropriate, Competent Bodies may require supporting documentation and may carry out independent verifications. 
The Competent Bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria (note: it is not required to implement such management schemes.). 
CRITERIA 
The criteria are divided into three main categories, concerning textile fibres, processes and chemicals, and fitness for use. 
TEXTILE FIBRE CRITERIA 
Fibre-specific criteria are set in this section for acrylic, cotton and other natural cellulosic seed fibres, elastane, flax and other bast fibres, greasy wool and other keratin fibres, man-made cellulose fibres, polyamide, polyester and polypropylene. Other fibres for which no fibre specific criteria are set are also allowed, with the exception of mineral fibres, glass fibres, metal fibres, carbon fibres and other inorganic fibres. 
The criteria set in this section for a given fibre-type need not be met if that fibre contributes to less than 5 % of the total weight of the textile fibres in the product. Similarly they need not be met if the fibres are of recycled origin. In this context, recycled fibres are defined as fibres originating only from cuttings from textile and clothing manufacturers or from post-consumer waste (textile or otherwise). Nevertheless, at least 85 % by weight of all fibres in the product must be either in compliance with the corresponding fibre-specific criteria, if any, or of recycled origin.
