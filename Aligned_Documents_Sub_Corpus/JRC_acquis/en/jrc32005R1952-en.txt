Council Regulation (EC) No 1952/2005 of 23 November 2005 concerning the common organisation of the market in hops and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 1696/71, (EEC) No 1037/72, (EEC) No 879/73 and (EEC) No 1981/82 
Council Regulation (EC) No 1952/2005 
of 23 November 2005 
concerning the common organisation of the market in hops and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 1696/71, (EEC) No 1037/72, (EEC) No 879/73 and (EEC) No 1981/82 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 36 and the third subparagraph of Article 37(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament [1], 
After consulting the European Economic and Social Committee [2], 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 of 26 July 1971 on the common organisation of the market in hops [3] has been substantially amended several times, in particular by Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers [4]. For the sake of clarity, Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 should be repealed and replaced. 
(2) Council Regulation (EEC) No 1037/72 of 18 May 1972 laying down general rules for granting and financing aid for hop producers [5], Council Regulation (EEC) No 1981/82 of 19 July 1982 drawing up the list of Community regions, in which production aid for hops is granted only to recognised producer groups [6], and Council Regulation (EEC) No 879/73 of 26 March 1973 on the granting and reimbursement of aid accorded by the Member States to recognised producer groups in the hop sector [7], which have become obsolete following the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, should also be repealed. However, since Slovenia does not plan to apply the single payment scheme until 1 January 2007, provision should be made for Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 and Regulations (EEC) No 1037/72 and (EEC) No 1981/82 to continue to apply in Slovenia for the 2006 harvest. 
(3) Hops and vegetable saps and extracts of hops are products which are generally interchangeable. To enable the objectives of Article 33 of the Treaty to be achieved and ensure that the common agricultural policy has full effect in the hops sector, the measures on trade with third countries and the marketing rules adopted for hops should be extended to vegetable saps and extracts of hops. 
(4) To ensure a fair standard of living for producers, Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 lays down aid schemes for certain sectors, including hops. 
(5) A quality policy should be followed throughout the Community by implementing provisions concerning certification together with rules prohibiting, as a general rule, the marketing of products for which a certificate has not been issued or, in the case of imported products, those which do not comply with equivalent minimum quality characteristics. 
(6) To stabilise markets and ensure reasonable prices for supplies to consumers, centralisation of supply and the joint adaptation by growers of their produce to the requirements of the market should be encouraged. 
(7) To that end the grouping of growers in bodies which require their members to comply with certain common rules should further the achievement of the objectives of Article 33 of the Treaty. 
(8) To avoid any discrimination between producers and to ensure the unity and effectiveness of any action undertaken, conditions should be laid down, for the whole of the Community, with which producer groups must comply in order to be recognised by the Member States. To achieve an effective centralisation of supply, it is necessary in particular that the groups should be of an economically viable size and that the entire output of producers should be marketed either directly by the group or by the producers, according to common rules. 
(9) The measures envisaged should enable an import scheme to be provided for, based solely on application of the common customs tariff. 
(10) These measures should make it possible to waive all quantitative restrictions at the external frontiers of the Community. This procedure may, however, in exceptional cases, be found to be inadequate. In such cases, in order not to leave the Community market defenceless against any disturbances arising therefrom, the Community should be empowered to take all necessary measures quickly. These measures should be in accordance with the Community’s international obligations. 
(11) The proper functioning of the internal market would be compromised by the grant of national aid. As a result, the provisions of the Treaty governing State aid should apply to the products covered by this common market organisation. 
(12) The experience gained in the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 has revealed the need for instruments enabling preventive action to be taken where a risk of structural surpluses or market disturbance arises. 
(13) Adequate information is needed about the present state of the market within the Community and the prospects for its development. Provision should therefore be made for the registration of all contracts to supply hops produced within the Community. 
(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [8]. 
(15) The transition from Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 to this Regulation is likely to create difficulties not envisaged in this Regulation. In order to deal with those difficulties, the Commission should be authorised to adopt transitional measures, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

(a) concentrating supply and helping to stabilise the market by marketing all the produce of the members or, if necessary, by purchasing hops at a higher price in accordance with Article 7(4)(a);

(h) their statutes include the obligation to keep separate accounts for the activities in respect of which they have been recognised; 
(i) they do not hold a dominant position in the Community. 
3. The obligation provided for in paragraph 2(c) shall not apply to products covered by sales contracts concluded by producers before they joined the producer group, provided that the latter was informed of and approved such contracts.

(a) replace the obligation to have all their production marketed by the producer group provided for in paragraph 2(c)(ii) with marketing in accordance with common rules incorporated in the statutes, in order to ensure that the producer group has the right to monitor selling prices, which it must approve, failure to do so requiring the group to buy back the hops concerned at a higher price;
