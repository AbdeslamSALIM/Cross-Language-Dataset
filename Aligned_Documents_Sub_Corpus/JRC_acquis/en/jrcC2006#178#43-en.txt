Case C-249/06: Action brought on 2 June 2006 — Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Sweden 
Action brought on 2 June 2006 — Commission of the European Communities v Kingdom of Sweden 
Parties 
Applicant: Commission of the European Communities (represented by: C. Tufvesson, B. Martenczuk and H. Stølvbæk, acting as Agents) 
Defendant: Kingdom of Sweden 
Form of order sought 
- Declare that, by failing to take appropriate steps to eliminate the incompatibilities between Sweden's bilateral investment agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, together with 16 further bilateral investment agreements, and the EC Treaty, the Kingdom of Sweden has failed to fulfil its obligations under the second paragraph of Article 307 EC; 
- order the Kingdom of Sweden to pay the costs. 
Pleas in law and main arguments 
The agreements are incompatible with Community law since they do not permit the application of Community measures based in Articles 57(2) EC, 59 EC and 60 EC. Further, Sweden has not taken steps to rectify the situation. Thus Sweden has failed to fulfil its obligations under the second paragraph of Article 307 EC to take all appropriate steps to eliminate all incompatibilities between the Treaty and the investment agreements.
