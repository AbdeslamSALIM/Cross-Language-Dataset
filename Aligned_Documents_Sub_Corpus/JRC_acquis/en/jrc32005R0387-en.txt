Commission Regulation (EC) No 387/2005 
of 8 March 2005 
amending (EC) Regulation No 831/97 laying down marketing standards applicable to avocados 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables [1], and in particular Article 2(2) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The Working Party on Standardisation of Perishable Produce and Quality Development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) has recently amended standard FFV-42 concerning the marketing and commercial quality control of avocados. For the sake of clarity and international transparency, account should be taken of such amendments in Commission Regulation (EC) No 831/97 [2]. 
(2) Maturity and development of avocados can be assessed by their dry matter contents. In order to exclude fruit unable to ripen, a requirement as to the minimum dry matter content should be introduced. 
(3) Trade in small-sized Hass avocados is growing and meets the demand of certain consumers. It is therefore necessary to decrease the minimum size for avocados of this variety. 
(4) Regulation (EC) No 831/97 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
It shall apply from 1 May 2005.
