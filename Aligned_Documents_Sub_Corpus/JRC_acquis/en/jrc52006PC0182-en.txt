Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters concerning the extension of the Protocol establishing the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau on fishing off the coast of Guinea-Bissau for the period 16 June 2006 to 15 June 2007 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
The Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau expired on 15 June 2006. This proposal for a Council Decision concerns the provisional application of the extension of the Protocol for one more year, until 15 June 2007. 
The two parties agreed in December 2005 to extend this Agreement, mainly in order to give the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau time to prepare itself as well as possible for negotiations on a future partnership agreement, taking account of the political context (elections in June 2005 and change of Government in November 2005), and to implement the action programme to support the control and inspection required for the sustainable development of the fisheries sector. This extension should thus enable the new Government to conduct negotiations under reasonable conditions and within reasonable deadlines, without suspending either the Agreement or the annual financial compensation, which is essential for balancing the budget of the State of Guinea-Bissau. 
The two parties agreed to extend the Protocol for one year, from 16 June 2006 to 15 June 2007. This extension, in the form of an Exchange of Letters, was initialled by the parties on 17 January 2006, and sets out the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of EC vessels in the waters of Guinea-Bissau for the period from 16 June 2006 to 15 June 2007. 
The Commission proposes, on this basis, that the Council adopt the Regulation on the conclusion of an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters extending the Protocol. 
A proposal for a Council Decision on the provisional application of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters extending the Protocol pending its final entry into force is the subject of a separate procedure.

3.2 Duration of the action and of the financial impact: 
The Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement between the European Community and Republic of Guinea-Bissau expires on 15 June 2006. The extension of the Protocol is concluded for one year. 
The Protocol sets out the financial contribution, the types of fishing and the conditions governing the fishing activities of Community vessels in the fishing zones of Guinea-Bissau. 
The two parties agreed in December 2005 to extend this Agreement, mainly in order to give the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau time to prepare itself as well as possible for negotiations on a future partnership agreement, taking account of the political context (elections in June 2005 and change of Government in November 2005), and to implement the action programme to support the control and inspection required for the sustainable development of the fisheries sector. This extension should thus enable the new Government to conduct negotiations under reasonable conditions and within reasonable deadlines, without suspending either the Agreement or the annual financial compensation, which is essential for balancing the budget of the State of Guinea-Bissau. 
The two parties agreed to extend the Protocol for one year, from 16 June 2006 to 15 June 2007. This extension, in the form of an Exchange of Letters, was initialled by the two parties on 17 January 2006, and sets out the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of EC vessels in the waters of Guinea-Bissau for the period from 16 June 2006 to 15 June 2007.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES 
5.1 Need to be met in the short or long term 
The two parties have agreed to extend the existing Protocol for one year, from 16 June 2006 to 15 June 2007. This extension, which is aimed at enabling Community shipowners to continue fishing in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Guinea-Bissau pending the negotiations on the amendments to be made to the Protocol, was initialled by the two parties on 17 January 2006, and sets out the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of EC vessels in the waters of Guinea-Bissau for the period covered. The main elements of the extended Protocol remain the same, with respect to fishing opportunities, the financial contribution and the amount of the fees paid by shipowners. 
5.2 Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy 
Regarding the extension of this Protocol, if the Community does not act, then private agreements will spring up which would not guarantee sustainable fisheries. The Community also hopes that this extension will enable the new Government to be ready to launch the negotiations on a partnership agreement in the fisheries sector without suspending the Agreement (and, therefore, the activities of the fleet fishing under the Community Agreement) or the annual financial compensation, which is essential for balancing the budget of the State of Guinea-Bissau. 
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework 
The aim of this extension is the same as that of the current protocol with Guinea-Bissau, namely to preserve access for Community fishing vessels to Guinea-Bissau's EEZ in accordance with the types of fishing provided for in the Agreement, while allowing the new Government of Guinea-Bissau extra time to prepare for the forthcoming negotiation on the renewal of the Protocol. 
The following indicators will be used in the context of the ABM for the purposes of monitoring implementation of the Agreement: 
( monitoring the utilisation rate of the fishing opportunities; 
( gathering and analysing data on catches and the commercial value of the Agreement; 
( contribution to employment and value-added in the Community; 
( contribution to stabilising the Community market; 
( contribution to the general objectives of reducing poverty in Guinea-Bissau, including the contribution to employment, development of infrastructure and support for the State budget; 
( number of technical meetings and meetings of the Joint Committee. 
5.4 Method of implementation (indicative) 
Show below the method(s)[12] chosen for the implementation of the action. 
X Centralised Management 
X Directly by the Commission 
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
6.1 Monitoring system 
The Commission (Directorate-General for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs), in collaboration with the Commission Delegation in Guinea-Bissau), will ensure regular monitoring of the implementation of this extension, particularly as regards its use by operators and catch data. 
6.2 Assessment 
The Protocol currently in force was thoroughly evaluated in December 2005 with the assistance of a consortium of independent consultants, with a view to the possible launch of negotiations on a new protocol. Given that the proposal is for extension of the Protocol's validity for one year only, no specific ex-ante evaluation has been carried out. 
6.2.1 Ex-ante evaluation 
The review of fishing opportunities (from 16 June 2004), as outlined below, and the reduction in the financial contribution from EUR 10 200 000 to EUR 7 260 000 made it possible to improve the profitability of the Agreement and the rate of use of the fishing opportunities granted by it. 
Use of the EC/Guinea-Bissau Fisheries Agreement 2001-06 
Types of fishing | Fishing opportun-ities offered up to 15/6/06) | Use in 2001/02[13] | Use in 2002/03 | Use in 2003/04 | Fishing oppor-tunities offered (since 16/6/04) | Use in 2004/05 | Use in 2005/06[14] | 
shrimps | 9600 | 1124 (23%) | 3098 (32%) | 4234 (44%) | 4400 | 4087 (93%) | 2249 (51%) | 
fin-fish/ cephalopods | 2800 | 816 (58%) | 1980 (71%) | 1564 (56%) | 4400 | 2067 (47%) | 221 (7%) | 
tuna seiners | 40 | 29 (73%) | 30 (75%) | 29 (73%) | 40 | 25 (63%) | 15 (38%) | 
pole-and-line vessels and surface longliners | 36 | 14 (39%) | 15 (42%) | 16 (44%) | 30 | 14 (47%) | 11 (37%) | 
The Agreement is clearly advantageous in that the catch value (average of around EUR 30 million over the period 2001-04 in terms of first-sale prices for landings) exceeds the cost of the Protocol. It is also beneficial to employment: jobs created in connection with the Agreement (directly and indirectly) are estimated at 509 for the EU and 141 for the partner country. 
- Value-added of Community involvement 
The value-added/turnover ratios are 9% for shrimp fishing, 8% for fin-fish/cephalopods, 8% for tuna seiners and 33% for pole-and-line tuna vessels and surface longliners. Around a third of the value-added is direct and most of the indirect value-added is derived at a later stage. 
The Fisheries Agreement is also essential to Guinea-Bissau's economic and political stability, and to its fishing industry. It provides a substantial share of the budgetary resources of the State of Guinea-Bissau (an average of 38% of budgetary resources over the last five years). 
- Risks and alternative options: 
A failure to extend the Agreement could cause the fleet to discontinue its activity under the Agreement and fall back on private licences, with the result that sustainable monitoring of the fishing effort could no longer be guaranteed; in addition, it could generate major difficulties for the economy and political stability of Guinea-Bissau, which would be deprived of a budgetary resource essential to the operation of its public services, and financing of the sector's operating costs (control, inspection, research, training, etc.) would no longer be properly covered. 
6.2.2 Ex-ante estimate of the economic value of the Agreement and the Community's financial contribution 
The financial contribution granted by the Community under this extension is a single allocation established on the basis of one year's extension of the total appropriation for the 2001-06 Protocol, i.e. EUR 7 260 000 by way of financial compensation for fishing opportunities. 
6.2.3 Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past) 
Apart from the review of fishing opportunities (from 16 June 2004) and the reduction in the financial contribution mentioned in point 6.2.1, which made it possible to enhance the profitability of the Agreement, implementation of the support measures representing an appreciable part of the Protocol as revised in 2004 is slow, on account of the weakness of Guinea-Bissau's Ministry of Fisheries, and reprogramming of outstanding amounts, on the basis of the implementing reports transmitted regularly, is being performed in conjunction with the authorities in order to take account of the substantial control and inspection requirements. 
7. Anti-fraud measures 
The use to which the financial contribution paid by the Community under the Agreement is put is entirely at the discretion of the sovereign third country concerned. 
Nevertheless, the Commission undertakes to try and establish permanent political dialogue and cooperation with a view to improving the management of the Protocol extension and strengthening the Community's contribution to the sustainable management of resources. 
In any case, any payment which the Commission makes under a fisheries agreement is subject to its standard rules and budgetary and financial procedures. This makes it possible, in particular, to fully identify the bank accounts of the third countries onto which the financial contribution is paid.
