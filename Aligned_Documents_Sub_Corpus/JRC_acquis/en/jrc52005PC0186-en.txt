Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters concerning the provisional application of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros on fishing off the Comoros for the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2010 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
The Protocol to the Fisheries Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros expired on 31 December 2004. A new Protocol was initialled by both parties on 24 November 2004 setting out the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of Community vessels in Comorian waters during the period 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2010 (6 years). 
The new Protocol grants fishing opportunities for 40 tuna seiners and 17 surface longliners. 
The financial contribution is fixed at EUR 390 000 per year, covering an annual catch of 6 000 tonnes of tuna in Comorian waters. A large portion of this amount (60%, or EUR 234 000 per year) is earmarked, under the new partnership approach fixed in the July 2004 Council guidelines on fisheries agreements, for defining and implementing the sectoral fisheries policy in the Comoros with a view to establishing responsible fishing. 
While it is in keeping with the tuna agreements concluded by the Community with certain Indian Ocean countries, this new Protocol reinforces the concept of responsible, sustainable fisheries and makes it possible to promote a partnership focussing on compliance with the laws and regulations in force under Comorian fisheries policy. 
New provisions have been introduced to this end: (i) the exclusivity clause, which prohibits the existence of private licences or other private arrangements outside the scope of the Agreement, (ii) VMS requirements to reinforce checks on vessels operating in Comorian waters, (iii) the social clause applicable to local seamen signed on by Community vessels, (iv) rules on taking on board observers. 
Moreover, in accordance with the Council guidelines of July 2004, the new Protocol has adjusted the costs of the Agreement between the Community and shipowners. The tuna fee for fishermen has been increased from EUR 25 to EUR 35/tonne, while the Community fee has been reduced from EUR 75 to EUR 65/tonne. This reallocation, already applied in the tuna agreements in the Pacific, will gradually be applied to all tuna agreements in the Community. 
On this basis, the Commission proposes that the Council adopt by Decision the draft Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters on the provisional application of the new Protocol pending its definitive entry into force. 
A proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the new Protocol is the subject of a separate procedure. 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters concerning the provisional application of the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros on fishing off the Comoros for the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2010 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 in conjunction with Article 300(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], 
Whereas: 
1. In accordance with the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros on fishing off the Comoros[2], the Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros held negotiations to determine amendments or additions to be made to the Agreement at the end of the period of application of the Protocol to the Agreement. 
2. As a result of those negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 24 November 2004. 
3. Under that Protocol, Community fishermen enjoy fishing opportunities in the waters falling within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros for the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2010. 
4. In order to ensure uninterrupted fishing activities by Community vessels, it is essential that the new Protocol be applied as quickly as possible. For this reason, the two parties have initialled an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters providing for the provisional application of the initialled Protocol as from 1 January 2005. 
5. The Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters should be approved, subject to the conclusion of the Protocol by the Council. 
6. The method of allocating the fishing opportunities among the Member States should be defined on the basis of the traditional allocation of fishing opportunities under the Fisheries Agreement, 
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:

- surface longliners: 17 vessels. 
2. Paragraph 1 shall apply subject to Articles 4 and 5 of this Protocol. 
3. Vessels flying the flag of a Member State of the European Community may fish in Comorian waters only if they are in possession of a fishing licence issued under this Protocol in accordance with the Annex hereto. 
Article 2 Financial contribution – Methods of payment 
1. For the period referred to in Article 1, the financial contribution referred to in Article 6 of the Agreement shall be EUR 2 340 000.

If the total quantity of catches by Community vessels exceeds 6 000 tonnes per year, the total amount of the annual financial contribution shall be increased by EUR 65 for each additional tonne caught. However, the total annual amount paid by the Community shall not be more than twice the amount indicated in paragraph 3 (EUR 780 000). Where the quantities caught by Community vessels exceed the quantities corresponding to twice the total annual amount, the amount due for the quantity exceeding that limit shall be paid the following year. 
5. Payment shall be made no later than 30 September 2005 for the first year and no later than the anniversary date of the Protocol for the following years.

In accordance with Article 5 of the Agreement, based on the recommendations and resolutions adopted within the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and the best available scientific advice, the parties shall consult each other within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 7 of the Agreement and, where necessary and by mutual agreement, take measures to ensure the sustainable management of fisheries resources concerning the activities of Community vessels. 
Article 4 Voluntary review of fishing opportunities 
1. The fishing opportunities referred to in Article 1 may be increased by mutual agreement insofar as the conclusions of the scientific meeting referred to in Article 3 confirm that such an increase will not endanger the sustainable management of Comorian resources. In this case the financial contribution referred to in Article 2(1) shall be increased proportionately and pro rata temporis . However, the total amount of the financial contribution paid by the European Community shall not be more than twice the adjusted amount. 
2. Where the quantities caught by Community vessels exceed twice the quantities corresponding to the adjusted total annual amount, the amount due for the amount exceeding that limit shall be paid the following year.

4. The allocation of the fishing opportunities among different categories of vessels may also be reviewed by mutual agreement between the parties, provided that any changes comply with recommendations made by the scientific meeting regarding the management of stocks liable to be affected by such redistribution. The parties shall agree on the corresponding adjustment of the financial contribution where the redistribution of fishing opportunities so warrants. 
Article5 New fishing opportunities 
Should Community vessels be interested in fishing activities which are not indicated in Article 1, the parties shall consult each other before any authorisation is granted by the Comorian authorities. Where appropriate, the parties shall agree on the conditions applicable to these new fishing opportunities and, if necessary, make amendments to this Protocol and to the Annex thereto. 
Article 6 Suspension and review of the payment of the financial contribution on grounds of force majeure 
1. Where serious circumstances, other than natural phenomena, prevent fishing activities in Comorian waters, the European Community may suspend payment of the financial contribution provided for in Article 2(1), following consultations between the parties where possible, and provided that the Community has paid in full any amounts due at the time of suspension. 
2. Payment of the financial contribution shall resume as soon as the parties find, by mutual agreement following consultations, that the circumstances preventing fishing activities are no longer present and that the situation allows a resumption of fishing activities. 
3. The validity of the licences granted to Community vessels under Article 4 of the Agreement shall be extended by a period equal to the period during which fishing activities were suspended. 
Article 7 Support for introducing responsible fishing in Comorian waters 
1. A share of 60% of the financial contribution referred to in Article 2(1) of this Protocol shall be put towards defining and implementing a sectoral fisheries policy in the Comoros with a view to introducing responsible fishing in its waters. This contribution shall be managed in the light of objectives identified by mutual agreement between the parties, and the annual and multiannual programming to attain them. 
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, as soon as this Protocol enters into force and no later than three months after that date, the parties shall agree, within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 7 of the Agreement, on a multiannual sectoral programme and detailed implementing rules covering, in particular: 
(a) annual and multiannual guidelines for using the percentage of the financial contribution referred to in paragraph 1; 
(b) the objectives, both annual and multiannual, to be achieved with a view to introducing, over time, responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries, taking account of the priorities expressed by the Comoros in its national fisheries policy and other policies relating to or having an impact on the introduction of responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries; 
(c) criteria and procedures for evaluating the results obtained each year. 
3. Any proposed amendments to the multiannual sectoral programme must be approved by both parties within the Joint Committee. 
4. Each year, the Comoros shall allocate the percentage of the financial contribution referred to in paragraph 1 with a view to implementing the multiannual programme. For the first year of application of the Protocol, that allocation must be notified to the Community at the time when the multiannual sectoral programme is approved within the Joint Committee. For each year thereafter, the Comoros shall notify the Community of the allocation no later than 30 November of the previous year. 
5. Where the annual evaluation of the progress made in implementing the multiannual sectoral programme so warrants, the parties shall hold consultations to agree rules for reallocating the financial contribution referred to in Article 2(1) of this Protocol with a view to bringing the actual amount of financial resources allocated to implementation of the programme into line with its results. 
Article 8 Disputes – Suspension of application of the Protocol

2. Without prejudice to Article 9, application of the Protocol may be suspended at the initiative of one party if the dispute between the parties is deemed to be serious and if the consultations held within the Joint Committee under paragraph 1 have not resulted in an amicable settlement. 
3. Suspension of application of the Protocol shall require the interested party to notify its intention in writing at least three months before the date on which suspension is due to take effect. 
4. In the event of suspension, the parties shall continue to consult with a view to finding an amicable settlement to their dispute.

6. Any additional payments shall be made by the shipowners to the competent Comorian authorities by 30 August of the following year at the latest, into the account referred to in point 7 of Section 1 of this Chapter. 
7. However, if the amount of the final statement is lower than the advance referred to in point 3 of this Section, the resulting balance shall not be reimbursable to the shipowner. 
CHAPTER II – FISHING ZONES 
To avoid adverse effects on small-scale fisheries in Comorian waters, Community vessels shall not be allowed to fish within 10 nautical miles of any of the islands nor within a radius of three nautical miles of fish aggregating devices placed by the Comorian Ministry responsible for fisheries, the positions of which have been communicated to the representative of the European Commission in Mauritius. 
These provisions may be reviewed by the Joint Committee referred to in Article 7 of the Agreement. 
CHAPTER III – CATCH REPORTING ARRANGEMENTS 
1. For the purposes of this Annex, the duration of a voyage by a Community vessel shall be defined as follows: 
- either the period elapsing between entering and leaving Comorian waters; 
- or the period elapsing between entering Comorian waters and a transhipment; 
- or the period elapsing between entering Comorian waters and a landing in the Comoros; 
2. All vessels authorised to fish in Comorian waters under the Agreement shall be obliged to communicate their catches to the Comorian Ministry responsible for fisheries in the following manner: 
2.1 Declarations shall include the catches made by the vessel during each trip. They shall be transmitted to the Comorian Ministry responsible for fisheries by electronic means, with a copy to the European Commission, at the end of each trip and, in all cases, before the vessel leaves Comorian waters. Electronic receipts shall be sent at once to the vessel by both addressees, with a copy to the other. 
2.2 The original of the declarations sent electronically during the annual period of validity of the licence within the meaning of point 2 of Section 3 of Chapter I of this Annex shall be transmitted on a physical medium to Comorian Ministry responsible for fisheries within 45 days following the end of the last trip made during the said period. Hard copies shall be sent to the European Community at the same time. 
2.3 Vessels shall declare their catches on the corresponding form in the logbook, in accordance with the specimen in Appendix 2. The words “Outside Comorian EEZ” shall be entered in the abovementioned logbook in respect of periods during which the vessel is not in Comorian waters. 
2.4 The forms shall be filled in legibly and signed by the master of the ship. 
3. Where the provisions set out in this Chapter are not complied with, the Government of the Comoros reserves the right to suspend the licence of the offending vessel until formalities have been completed and to apply the penalty laid down in current Comorian legislation. The European Commission shall be informed thereof. 
CHAPTER IV – EMBARKING SEAMEN 
1. Each Community vessel shall take on board, at its own expense, at least one local seaman during a trip in Comorian waters. 
2. Shipowners shall endeavour to take on board additional local seamen. 
3. Shipowners shall be free to select the seamen they take on board their vessels from the names on a list submitted by the competent Comorian authorities. 
4. The shipowner or agent shall inform the competent Comorian authorities of the names of the local seamen taken on board the vessel concerned, mentioning their position in the crew. 
5. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work shall apply as of right to seamen signed on by EU vessels. This concerns in particular the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 
6. Local seamen’s employment contracts, a copy of which shall be given to the signatories, shall be drawn up between the shipowners’ agent(s) and the seamen and/or their trade unions or representatives in consultation with the competent Comorian authorities. These contracts shall guarantee the seamen the social security cover applicable to them, including life assurance and sickness and accident insurance. 
7. Local seamen’s wages shall be paid by the shipowners. They shall be fixed, before licences are issued, by mutual agreement between the shipowners or their agents and the Comorian authorities. However, the wage conditions granted to Comorian seamen shall not be lower than those applied to Comorian crews and shall under no circumstances be below ILO standards. 
8. All seamen employed aboard Community vessels shall report to the master of the vessel designated on the day before their proposed embarkation date. Where a seaman fails to report at the date and time agreed for embarkation, shipowners shall be automatically absolved of their obligation to take the seaman on board. 
9. Where no local seamen are taken on board for reasons other than that referred to in the previous point, Community shipowners shall be obliged to pay, for each day of the fishing trip in Comorian waters, a flat-rate amount of USD 20 per day. The payment of this amount will take place within the limits laid down in point I.2.6 of this Annex. 
10. This sum shall be used for training local seamen and shall be paid into the account specified by the Comorian authorities. 
CHAPTER V - TECHNICAL MEASURES 
1. Community vessels shall comply with the measures and recommendations adopted by Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) regarding fishing gear and the technical specifications thereof and all other technical measures applicable to their fishing activities. 
CHAPTER VI – OBSERVERS 
1. Vessels authorised to fish in Comorian waters under the Agreement shall take on board observers appointed by the Comorian authorities on the terms set out below. 
1.1 At the request of the Comorian Ministry responsible for fisheries, tuna vessels shall take on board an observer designated by the former to check catches made in Comorian waters. 
1.2 The competent Comorian authorities shall draw up a list of vessels designated to take an observer on board and a list of the appointed observers. These lists shall be kept up to date. They shall be forwarded to the European Commission as soon as they have been drawn up and every three months thereafter where they have been updated. 
1.3 The competent Comorian authorities shall inform the shipowners concerned, or their agents, of the name of the observer appointed to be taken on board their vessel at the time the licence is issued, or no later than 15 days before the observer’s planned embarkation date. 
2. The time spent on board by observers shall be one fishing trip. However, at the express request of the competent Comorian authorities, this embarkation may be spread over several trips according to the average duration of trip for a particular vessel. This request shall be made by the competent Comorian authorities when the name of the observer appointed to board the vessel in question is notified. 
3. The conditions under which observers are taken on board shall be agreed between shipowners or their agents and the Comorian authorities. 
4. Observers shall be taken on board at a port chosen by the shipowner at the beginning of the first voyage in Comorian waters after notification of the list of designated ships. 
5. Within two weeks and giving ten days’ notice, the shipowners concerned shall make known at which Comorian ports and on what dates they intend to take observers on board. 
6. Where observers are taken on board in a foreign port, their travel costs shall be borne by the shipowner. Should a vessel with a Comorian observer on board leave Comorian waters, all measures must be taken to ensure the observer’s return to the Comoros as soon as possible at the expense of the shipowner. 
7. If the observer is not present at the time and place agreed and during the twelve hours following the time agreed, shipowners shall be automatically absolved of their obligation to take the observer on board. 
8. Observers shall be treated as officers. They shall carry out the following tasks: 
8.1 observe the fishing activities of the vessels; 
8.2 verify the position of vessels engaged in fishing operations; 
8.3 perform biological sampling in the context of scientific programmes; 
8.4 note the fishing gear used; 
8.5 verify the catch data for Comorian waters recorded in the logbook; 
8.6 verify the percentages of by-catches and estimate the quantity of discards of species of marketable fin-fish, crustaceans and cephalopods; 
8.7 report fishing data by radio, including the quantity of catches and by-catches on board. 
9. Masters shall do everything in their power to ensure the physical safety and welfare of observers during performance of their duties. 
10. As far as possible, observers shall be offered every facility needed to carry out their duties. The master shall give them access to the means of communication needed for the discharge of their duties, to documents directly concerned with the vessel’s fishing activities, including in particular the logbook and the navigation log, and to those parts of the vessel necessary to facilitate the exercise of their tasks as observer. 
11. While on board, observers shall: 
11.1 take all appropriate steps to ensure that the conditions of their boarding and presence on the vessel neither interrupt nor hamper fishing operations, 
11.2 respect the material and equipment on board and the confidentiality of all documents belonging to the said vessel. 
12. At the end of the observation period and before leaving the vessel, observers shall draw up an activity report to be transmitted to the competent Comorian authorities, with a copy to the European Commission. They shall sign it in the presence of the master, who may add or cause to be added to it any observations considered relevant, followed by the master’s signature. A copy of the report shall be handed to the master when the observer is put ashore. 
13. Shipowners shall bear the cost of accommodating observers in the same conditions as the officers on the vessel. 
14. The salary and social contributions of the observer shall be borne by the competent Comorian authorities. 
15. Shipowners shall contribute USD 20 per day per vessel to the costs of scientific observation. This contribution shall be payable at the same time as, and be additional to, the fee payable by the shipowner. 
CHAPTER VII - MONITORING 
1. The European Community shall keep an up-to-date list of the vessels to which a fishing licence has been issued under this Protocol. This list shall be notified to the Comorian authorities responsible for fisheries inspection as soon as it is drawn up and each time it is updated. 
2. Community vessels may be included on the list referred to in the previous point upon receipt of notification of the advance payment referred to in point 3 of Section 2 of Chapter I of this Annex. The shipowner may then obtain a certified copy of this list to be kept on board instead of the fishing licence until the licence has been issued. 
3. Entering and leaving the zone:

Appendix 3 
PROVISIONS SPECIFYING HOW DATA IN CONNECTION WITH THE SATELLITE-BASED POSITION MONITORING OF COMMUNITY FISHING VESSELS OPERATING UNDER THE FISHERIES AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY AND THE ISLAMIC FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF THE COMOROS IS TO BE TRANSMITTED 
In view of the fact that the Union of the Comoros plans to implement a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) applicable to its national fleet and intends to extend this system on a non-discriminatory basis to all vessels operating in its fishing zone, and that Community vessels have been subject to satellite monitoring wherever they operate since 1 January 2000 under Community legislation, it is recommended that the national authorities of the flag States and of the Union of the Comoros should monitor by satellite vessels operating under the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros on fishing off the Comoros in accordance with the following arrangements: 
1. For the purposes of satellite monitoring, the Comorian authorities will communicate to the Community the coordinates (latitudes and longitudes) of the Comorian fishing zone based on the attached model (Table I) before the entry into force of these provisions. 
The Comorian authorities shall transmit this information in electronic form, expressed in decimal degrees, to the WGS-84 datum system. 
2. The parties shall exchange information on X.25 addresses and the specifications for electronic data transmission between their Control Centres in accordance with 4 to 6. Such information shall include the following where they exist: names, telephone, telex and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses (Internet or X.400) which may be used for general communications between Control Centres. 
3. The position of vessels shall be determined with a margin of error of less than 500 metres and a confidence interval of 99%. 
4. When a vessel which is fishing under the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros and is the subject of satellite-based monitoring pursuant to Community legislation enters a fishing zone of the Union of the Comoros, the subsequent position reports shall immediately be transmitted by the Control Centre of the flag State to the Comorian Fisheries Monitoring Centre (FMC) at intervals of no more than two hours. The messages concerned shall be identified as position reports. 
5. The messages specified at 4 shall be transmitted electronically in X.25 format, without any further protocol. They shall be communicated in real time in the format set out in Table II. 
6. Where the continuous satellite monitoring equipment installed on board a fishing vessel develops a technical fault or breaks down, the skipper of the vessel shall transmit the information specified at 4 to the Control Centre of the flag State in good time. In such circumstances, it will be necessary to send a position report every 12 hours while the vessel is in a fishing zone of the Union of the Comoros. The Control Centre of the flag State or the fishing vessel shall send these messages immediately to the FMC. The defective equipment shall be repaired or replaced as soon as the vessel completes its fishing trip and, in any case, within one month at the latest. After this deadline, the vessel in question may not undertake any further fishing trips until the equipment has been repaired or replaced. 
7. The Control Centres of the flag States shall monitor the movements of their vessels in Comorian waters at two-hourly intervals. If the vessels are not being monitored in accordance with the conditions laid down, the FMC shall be informed immediately and the procedure laid down at 6 shall be applicable. 
8. If the FMC establishes that the flag State is not transmitting the information specified at 4, the other party shall be informed immediately. 
9. The monitoring data communicated to the other party in accordance with these provisions is intended solely for the purposes of the Comorian authorities in controlling and monitoring the Community fleet fishing under the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros. Such data may not under any circumstances be communicated to other parties. 
10. The parties agree to take all necessary steps to meet the message requirements laid down at 4 and 6 as soon as possible, and in no case later than six months after these provisions enter into force. 
11. The parties agree to exchange upon request information on the equipment used for satellite monitoring, in order to ensure that each piece of equipment is fully compatible with the requirements of the other party for the purposes of these provisions. 
12. Any dispute over the interpretation or application of these provisions shall be the subject of consultation between the parties within the Joint Committee referred to in Article 7 of the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros on fishing off the Comoros. 
13. These provisions shall enter into force on the tenth day following notification by the Comorian authorities to the Delegation of the Commission of the European Communities in Mauritius of the entry into operation of the Comorian fisheries monitoring centre.
