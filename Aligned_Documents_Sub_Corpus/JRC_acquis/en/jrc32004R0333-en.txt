Whereas:

Economic operators in those countries must be given the possibility therefore of participating fully in those quotas upon accession.

The deadline for submitting applications should also be amended. 
(3) It is therefore necessary, for 2004, to provide for amendments and adjustments to the measures laid down in Articles 2 and 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1898/97.
