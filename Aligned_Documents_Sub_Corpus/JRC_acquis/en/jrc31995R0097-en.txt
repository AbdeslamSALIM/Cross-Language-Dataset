Commission Regulation (EC) No 97/95 of 17 January 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the minimum price and compensatory payment to be paid to potato producers and of Council Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch 
COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 97/95 of 17 January 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the minimum price and compensatory payment to be paid to potato producers and of Council Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1866/94 (2), and in particular Article 8 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1543/93 of 14 June 1993 fixing the amount of the premium paid to producers of potato starch during the 1993/94, 1994/95 and 1995/96 marketing years (3), and in particular Article 3 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 of 27 July 1994 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch (4), and in particular Article 8 thereof, 
Whereas Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 lays down a system of quotas for the production of potato starch which may benefit from Community aid; whereas Member States are to allocate such quotas on the basis of production in a reference period and of investments made by undertakings producing potato starch before 31 January 1994 which did not give rise to production in the reference period; whereas both criteria are of equal importance; whereas it is necessary to make provision for a proportionate adjustment to allocations in order to ensure that such producers do not exceed a Member State's quota; 
Whereas conditions should be set in order to ensure that only genuine investments which have given rise to more than a minimal increase in production before 31 January 1994 should be taken into account by Member States in the allocation of sub-quotas; 
Whereas conditions should be included to ensure that the reserve of 110 000 tonnes, created to cover production in Germany in the marketing year 1996/97, is used only for cases where the production results from investments irreversibly undertaken before 31 January 1994 and only after exhaustion of any quota made available as a result of the cessation of trading of undertakings producing potato starch; 
Whereas it is necessary to specify what matters should be covered by a cultivation contract between an undertaking producing potato starch and a producer so as to prevent the conclusion of contracts in excess of the undertaking's sub-quota; whereas such undertakings should be prohibited from accepting delivery of potatoes not covered by a cultivation contract, as this would put at risk the effectiveness of the quota system and the requirement that the minimum price under Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 be paid for all potatoes intended for starch production; whereas, nevertheless, it should be possible, where climatic reasons lead to production in the areas covered by the cultivation contract of a larger quantity of potatoes or of potatoes with a higher starch content than was originally foreseen, for an undertaking producing potato starch to accept such potatoes provided that it pays the minimum price, referred to above; 
Whereas potatoes having a starch content of less than 13 % cannot be considered potatoes intended for the manufacture of potato starch within the meaning of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92; whereas potatoes with a starch content of less than 13 % should not be accepted by starch producing undertakings; whereas the Commission should, where climatic reasons lead to a lower starch content, and at the request of a Member State, be able to authorize the acceptance of potatoes having a starch content of not less than 12,8 %; 
Whereas, for the sake of clarity, some of the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1543/93 which are compatible with, and necessary for, the application of the quota system should be incorporated in this Regulation; 
Whereas it is necessary to define acceptable methods for determining the underwater weight of potatoes and to provide a table showing the corresponding starch content and aid payable; 
Whereas inspection measures should be introduced to ensure that only starch produced in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation gives rise to compensatory payments or to payment of the premium; 
Whereas, in order to protect producers of potatoes intended for the production of starch, it is essential for the minimum price set out in Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 to be paid for all potatoes; whereas it is therefore necessary to provide for sanctions where the minimum price has not been paid, or where undertakings have accepted potatoes not covered by a cultivation contract; 
Whereas rules are necessary to ensure that potato starch produced in excess of an undertaking's sub-quota is exported without export refund, as is required by Article 6 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94; whereas sanctions should be applied in the event of any breach; 
Whereas it is necessary to specify what will happen to the sub-quota of undertakings which merge, change ownership or cease trading; 
Whereas, in order to enable the Member States and the Commission to control the operation of the quota system, the information to be communicated by undertakings producing potato starch to the Member State, and by the Member State to the Commission, should be specified; 
Whereas, since Regulation (EEC) No 1543/93 is to be repealed with effect from 1 July 1995, on which date the quota system comes into operation, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1711/93 (5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1993/94 (6), should be repealed; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

For the 1997/98 marketing year, only actual production in 1996/97, subject to a maximum limit of 110 000 tonnes, shall create a right to a supplementary sub-quota. 
Title II PRICE AND PREMIUM SYSTEM 
Article 4 
1. A cultivation contract shall be concluded for each marketing year. Each contract shall have an identification number and include at least the following information: 
- the name and address of the producer or group of producers, 
- the name and address of the starch-producing undertaking, 
- the areas cultivated, in hectares and ares, 
- the quantity of potatoes in tonnes to be harvested there and delivered to the undertaking, 
- the average starch content of the potatoes, based on the average starch content of the potatoes delivered by the producer to the undertaking over the last three marketing years or, if such information is not available, on the average content for the area of supply, 
- a commitment by the undertaking to pay the producer the minimum price referred to in Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92. 
2. Each starch-producing undertaking shall forward to the competent authority by 31 May preceding the marketing year in question a summary of the contracts, including for each contract, the identification number, the name of the producer and the tonnage contracted, expressed in terms of starch equivalent. 
3. The total in starch equivalent of the quantities listed in the cultivation contracts shall not exceed the sub-quota established for that undertaking. 
4. Where the quantity actually produced under the cultivation contract in starch equivalent exceeds the quantity stated in the contract, that quantity may be delivered, if the undertaking so chooses, provided the minimum price referred to in Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 is paid for it. 
5. An undertaking may not take delivery of potatoes not covered by a cultivation contract. 
Article 5 
Starch manufacturers shall take delivery of potatoes either at the starch-producing undertakings themselves or at their delivery points. The operations described in Articles 6 and 8 shall be carried out at the time of delivery and under the authority of an inspector approved by the Member State. 
Article 6

2. The undertaking shall refuse consignments which have a starch content of less than 13 %. 
However, on receipt of a reasoned request from the Member State, a derogation from this rule may be granted, in particular for climatic reasons, and a starch content of not less than 12,8 % accepted. In that case the minimum price to be paid shall be that for a starch content of 13 %. The Commission shall adopt rules to implement this paragraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92. 
3. The net weight of the potatoes shall be determined by one of the methods described in Annex I. 
Article 7 
1. The premium shall be granted to starch-producing undertakings in respect of starch produced from potatoes of sound and fair marketable quality, on the basis of the quantity of potatoes used and their starch content, at the rates laid down in Annex II up to the quantity of starch for which they hold a sub-quota. 
Where the starch content of the potatoes is calculated by Reimann's or Parrow's scale and corresponds to a figure appearing on two or three lines in the second column of Annex II, the rates applicable shall be those for the second or third line. 
2. Where the batches delivered contain 25 % or more of potatoes which can pass through a screen with a square mesh of 28 mm (hereinafter described as 'tailings'), the net weight used for determining the minimum price to be paid by the starch manufacturer shall be reduced as follows: 
%quot%%quot% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%25 to 30 %%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%10 %%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%31 to 40 %%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%15 %%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%41 to 50 %%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%20 %%quot%%gt% 
If the batches contain more than 50 % of tailings, they shall be dealt with by mutual agreement and no premium shall be paid thereon. 
The percentage of tailings shall be determined at the same time as the net weight. 
3. Observance of the limits of the sub-quota by the undertakings shall be determined on the basis of the quantity and starch content of the potatoes used, in accordance with the rates laid down in Annex II. 
Article 8 
The starch content of the potatoes shall be determined on the basis of an underwater weight valid for 5 050 grams of potatoes supplied. 
The water used shall be clean and without additives and its temperature shall be less than 18 °C. 
Article 9 
1. A receipt form shall be drawn up under the joint responsibility of the starch-producing undertaking, the approved inspector and the supplier. The undertaking shall deliver a copy to the producer and retain the original so that it may, if necessary, be submitted to the agency responsible for the monitoring of premiums.

1. In the event of the merger or transfer of starch-producing undertakings and in the event of the transfer of starch factories, the quotas referred to in Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 shall be adjusted as follows: 
(a) in the event of the merger of starch-producing undertakings, the Member State shall allocate to the undertaking resulting from the merger a sub-quota equal to the sum of the sub-quotas allocated prior to the merger to the starch-producing undertakings concerned; 
(b) in the event of the transfer of a starch-producing undertaking, the Member State shall allocate to the transferee undertaking the sub-quota of the undertaking transferred. Where there is more than one transferee undertaking, the sub-quota shall be allocated in proportion to the production of starch which each has absorbed; 
(c) in the event of the transfer of a starch factory, the Member State shall reduce the sub-quota of the undertaking transferring ownership of the factory and increase the sub-quota of the starch-producing undertaking or undertakings purchasing the factory in question by the quantity deducted, in proportion to the production absorbed. 
2. In the event of the closure, in circumstances other than those referred to in paragraph 1, of: 
(a) a starch-producing undertaking; 
(b) one or more factories of a starch-producing undertaking, 
the Member State may allocate the sub-quotas involved by such closure to one or more starch-producing undertakings. 
3. In the event of the lease of a factory belonging to a starch-producing undertaking, the Member State shall reduce the sub-quota of the undertaking which offers the factory for rent and shall allocate the portion by which the sub-quota was reduced to the undertaking which rents the factory in order to produce starch in it. 
If the lease is terminated before the term referred to in Article 1 (k), the adjustment of the sub-quota pursuant to the preceding subparagraph shall be cancelled retroactively by the Member State as from the date on which the lease took effect. 
Article 18 
The measures referred to in Article 17 shall take effect when the closure of the undertaking or factory, the merger or transfer occurs: 
(a) between 1 July and 31 March of the following year, for the marketing year current during that period; 
(b) between 1 April and 30 June of the same year, for the marketing year following that period.

ANNEX I 
Method A The net weight of the potatoes is determined by taking samples. Samples are taken from several parts of the means of transport used and at three different levels, namely the upper, middle and lower levels. 
The residual earth is discharged before the means of transport is weighed empty. 
Samples taken for weight checking should weigh not less than 20 kilograms. The tubers are washed, cleaned of any extraneous matter and re-weighed. 
The recorded weight is reduced by 2 % to allow for the quantity of water absorbed during washing. The result constitutes the total reduction to be applied to 1 000 kilograms of potatoes. 
Method B The potatoes constituting a batch from a single grower are collected in silos. 
The potatoes are washed, the extraneous matter is removed and the total actual weight of the potatoes in the silos is determined, allowing 2 % for absorbed water. 
Method C 1. This method of determining the actual weight of the potatoes shall apply where batches of potatoes from different growers are collected in the same silo, provided that the growers have first agreed to the use of this method. 
Before the total actual weight of the batches is determined, the net weight of each batch must be determined by means of Method A. 
2. The potatoes collected in the silo are then washed, the extraneous matter is removed and their total actual weight is determined, allowing 2 % for absorbed water. 
3. If the total weight of the batches of washed potatoes is different from the sum of the weights obtained by means of Method A, the following correction is applied: the total weight mentioned at point 2 above is multiplied by the net weight obtained by means of Method A for each batch in turn. 
Each result is divided by the total net weight of the batches as determined by means of Method A.
