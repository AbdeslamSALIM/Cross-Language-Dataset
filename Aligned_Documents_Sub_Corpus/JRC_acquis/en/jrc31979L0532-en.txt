Council Directive 79/532/EEC of 17 May 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the component type-approval of lighting and light- signalling devices on wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 17 May 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the component type-approval of lighting and light-signalling devices on wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors (79/532/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas the technical requirements which tractors must satisfy pursuant to national laws relate inter alia to their lighting and light-signalling devices; 
Whereas those requirements differ from one Member State to another ; whereas it is therefore necessary that all Member States adopt the same requirements, either in addition to or in place of their existing rules, in order, in particular, to allow the EEC type-approval procedure which was the subject of the Council Directive 74/150/EEC of 4 March 1974 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors (4), to be applied in respect of each type of tractor; 
Whereas in Directive 78/933/EEC (5) the Council laid down common requirements for the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors; 
Whereas such lighting and light-signalling devices possess the same characteristics as those fitted to motor vehicles ; whereas, therefore, devices having received an EEC component type-approval mark in accordance with the Directives already adopted on this subject in connection with the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers may also be used on agricultural tractors, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
