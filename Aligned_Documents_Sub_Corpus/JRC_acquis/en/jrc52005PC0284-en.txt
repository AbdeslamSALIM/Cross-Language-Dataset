Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
concerning the placing on the market, in accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, of a maize product ( Zea mays L., line 1507) genetically modified for resistance to certain lepidopteran pests and for tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. In accordance with Article 13 of Directive 2001/18/EC, the Dutch authorities received a notification (Reference C/NL/00/10) concerning the placing on the market of maize product ( Zea mays L . line 1507), genetically modified for resistance to certain lepidopteran pests and for tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium. 
2. The notification covers importation and use as for any other maize grains including feed, with the exception of cultivation and uses as or in food, in the Community, of varieties derived from the 1507 transformation event. 
3. In accordance with Article 14 of the Directive, the Dutch competent authority forwarded to the Commission its assessment report of the notification, which concluded that no reasons have emerged on the basis of which consent for the placing on the market of the Zea mays L. line 1507 should be withheld, provided that specific conditions are fulfilled. 
4. The Commission forwarded the assessment report to all other Member States, some of which raised and maintained objections to the said report in terms of molecular characterisation, sampling methods, allergenicity, toxicity and monitoring of the product. 
5. Since objections were maintained, the Commission decided to consult the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The EFSA concluded, in an opinion adopted on 24 September 2004, that from all evidence provided, the Zea mays L. line 1507 is unlikely to have an adverse effect on human and animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed use. The EFSA also found that the scope of the monitoring plan provided by the applicant is in line with the intended uses of 1507 maize. 
6. Under such circumstances, Article 18 of Directive 2001/18/EC requires the Commission to take a decision in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2) of the Directive to which Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof. 
7. Since both the Dutch authorities and the EFSA gave a positive assessment concerning the placing on the market of 1507 maize, the Commission prepared a draft Decision authorising the use of this product, with the exception of cultivation and uses as or in food, and its placing on the market subject to specific conditions. 
8. The draft Decision was submitted, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Decision 1999/468/EC, for opinion, to the Committee set up under Article 30 of Directive 2001/18/EC. 
9. The Committee did not deliver an opinion on 17 May 2005, which requires that, the Commission, in accordance with Article 5(4) of Decision 1999/468/EC, shall, without delay, submit to the Council a proposal relating to the measures to be taken and shall inform the European Parliament – which was informed on 24 May 2005. 
10. Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC provides that the Council may, where appropriate in view of any such position, act by qualified majority within a period set at three months in accordance with Article 30(2) of Directive 2001/18/EC. If within that three-month period, the Council has indicated by qualified majority that it opposes the proposal, the Commission shall re-examine it; whereas if, on expiry of that period the Council has neither adopted the proposed implementing act nor indicated its opposition, then the proposed implementing act shall be adopted by the Commission. 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
concerning the placing on the market, in accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, of a maize product ( Zea mays L., line 1507) genetically modified for resistance to certain lepidopteran pests and for tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate-ammonium

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC[1], and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 18(1) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
1. Pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC, the placing on the market of a product containing or consisting of a genetically modified organism or a combination of genetically modified organisms is subject to written consent being granted by the competent authority of a Member State, in accordance with the procedure laid down in that Directive. 
2. A notification concerning the placing on the market of a genetically modified maize product ( Zea mays L., line 1507) was submitted by Pioneer Hi-Bred International, INC and Mycogen Seeds to the competent authority of the Netherlands (ref C/NL/00/10). 
3. The notification covers importation and use as for any other maize grains including feed, with the exception of cultivation and uses as or in food, in the Community, of varieties derived from the 1507 transformation event. 
4. In accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 14 of Directive 2001/18/EC, the competent authority of the Netherlands prepared an assessment report, which was submitted to the Commission and the competent authorities of the other Member States; whereby the assessment report concluded that no reasons have emerged on the basis of which consent for the placing on the market of Zea mays L. line 1507 should be withheld, provided that specific conditions are fulfilled. 
5. The competent authorities of other Member States raised objections to the placing on the market of the product. 
6. The opinion adopted on 24 September 2004 by the European Food Safety Authority, concluded that Zea mays L. line 1507 is unlikely to have an adverse effect on human and animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed use. The European Food Safety Authority also deemed that the monitoring plan provided by the applicant was in line with the intended uses of 1507 maize. 
7. An examination of each of the objections in the light of Directive 2001/18/EC, of the information submitted in the notification and of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, discloses no reason to believe that the placing on the market of Zea mays L. line 1507 will adversely affect human or animal health or the environment. 
8. A unique identifier should be assigned to the 1507 maize for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC[2] and Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms[3]. 
9. Adventitious or technically unavoidable traces of genetically modified organisms in products are exempted from labelling and traceability requirements in accordance with thresholds established under Directive 2001/18/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed[4]. 
10. In view of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, it is not necessary to establish specific conditions for the intended uses with regard to the handling or packaging of the product and the protection of particular ecosystems, environments or geographical areas. 
11. Prior to the placing on the market of the product, the necessary measures to ensure its labelling and traceability at all stages of its placing on the market, including verification by appropriate validated detection methodology, should be applicable. 
12. The Committee established under Article 30 of Directive 2001/18/EC has not delivered an opinion on the measures laid down in a draft Commission Decision, following its consultation, on 17 May 2005, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30(2) of that Directive,
