(5) Community assistance for Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo as defined by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999, and in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is programmed in Country Strategy Papers for the period 2002 to 2006, in line with the Community's financial perspectives. The Commission is in the process of proposing multi-annual indicative programmes for the period 2005-2006 for these countries and territories.
