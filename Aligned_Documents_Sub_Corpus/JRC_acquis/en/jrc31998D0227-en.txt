Whereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee in its report of 3 June 1996 has given an opinion concerning microbiological testing methods offering equivalent guarantees and whereas account should be taken of it; 
Whereas it is therefore appropriate to amend Decisions 95/409/EC (4), 95/410/EC (5) and 95/411/EC (6) laying down microbiological testing by sampling for certain meat intended for Finland and Sweden, in order to introduce the possibility, firstly, of using the microbiological method offering equivalent guarantees proposed in the opinion and, secondly, of authorizing new methods offering equivalent guarantees; 
Whereas for the authorisation of new methods offering equivalent guarantees, it is appropriate to provide for a procedure of close cooperation between the Commission and the Member States analogous to those set out in Article 16 of Directive 64/433/EEC or in Article 21 of Directive 71/118/EEC or in Article 32 of Directive 90/539/EEC,
