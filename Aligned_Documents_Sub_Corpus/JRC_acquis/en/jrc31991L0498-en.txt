Council Directive 91/498/EEC of 29 July 1991 on the conditions for granting temporary and limited derogations from specific Community health rules on the production and marketing of fresh meat 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 29 July 1991 on the conditions for granting temporary and limited derogations from specific Community health rules on the production and marketing of fresh meat (91/498/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas fresh meat is included on the list of products in Annex II to the Treaty; whereas their marketing provides a source of income for a large part of the farming population; 
Whereas, to ensure rational development of the sector, increase productivity and progressively to establish the conditions for an internal market, health rules applying 
to production and marketing have been laid down at Community level by Directive 64/433/EEC (4) as amended and codified by Directive 91/497/EEC (5); 
Whereas it is possible that, because of particular circumstances, some establishments will be unable, by 
1 January 1993, to comply with all of the specific rules laid down; whereas in order to take account of local situations and to prevent abrupt closures of establishments, arrangements should be made for limited and temporary derogations for establishments in operation before 1 January 1992; 
Whereas the granting of derogations from specific Community health rules to certain establishments is without prejudice to the requirement that all production and marketing operations conform to the hygiene rules laid down by Directive 64/433/EEC; 
Whereas to forestall any risk of abuse, these derogations must be strictly controlled by the Commission; whereas to this end, there should be a procedure for close and effective cooperation between the Commission and the Member States within the Standing Veterinary Committee, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

2. Derogations as referred to in paragraph 1 may be granted only to establishments which have, before 1 April 1992, submitted an application for a derogation to the relevant national authority. 
This application must be accompanied by a work plan and programme indicating the period within which it would be possible for the establishment to comply with the requirements referred to in paragraph 1.

to in the first subparagraph or whose applications have been 
refused by the Member State concerned shall be withdrawn before 1 January 1993.
