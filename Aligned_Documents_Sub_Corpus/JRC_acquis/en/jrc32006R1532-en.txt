Council Regulation (EC) No 1532/2006 
of 12 October 2006 
on the conditions for certain import quotas of high quality beef 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) It is advisable to adopt measures that would ensure compliance with the conditions for certain tariff quotas for imports of high quality beef into the Community. 
(2) Discussions with the countries exporting high quality beef within the EC-WTO tariff quotas of 11000 t, 5000 t and 4000 t respectively have revealed the need to better adapt the import conditions for these quotas. 
(3) To clarify the situation, it is appropriate to allocate the relevant tariff quotas for which Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay are the sole suppliers to the respective country. 
(4) The Commission should subsequently adopt definitions which are more easily auditable and verifiable in accordance with the procedure foreseen in Article 32(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal [1] so as to allow for an ex post verification and audit of the definition compliance, without changing the basic import conditions, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
The conditions for the EC-WTO tariff quotas of 11000 t, 5000 t and 4000 t respectively for imports of high quality beef of CN codes 02013000, 02023090, 02061095 and 02062991 into the Community shall apply as specified in the Annex to this regulation. 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
