Council Directive 90/496/EEC of 24 September 1990 on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs 
***** 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 
of 24 September 1990 
on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs 
(90/496/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas it is important that measures should be adopted with a view to the progressive establishment of the internal market by 31 December 1992; whereas the internal market is an area without internal frontiers in which freedom of movement is ensured for goods, persons, services and capital; 
Whereas there is growing public interest in the relationship between diet and health and in the choice of an appropriate diet to suit individual needs; 
Whereas the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, in their resolution of 7 July 1986 on the European programme against cancer, considered the improvement of nutrition to be a priority; 
Whereas knowledge of the basic principles of nutrition and appropriate nutrition labelling of foodstuffs would contribute significantly towards enabling the consumer to make this choice; 
Whereas the provision of nutrition labelling should assist action in the area of nutrition education for the public; 
Whereas, for the benefit of the consumer on the one hand, and to avoid any possible technical barriers to trade on the other, nutrition labelling should be presented in a standardized form applying throughout the Community; 
Whereas foodstuffs bearing nutrition labelling should conform to the rules laid down in this Directive; 
Whereas all other forms of nutrition labelling should be prohibited but foodstuffs bearing no nutrition labelling should be able to circulate freely; 
Whereas, to appeal to the average consumer and to serve the purpose for which it is introduced, and given the current low level of knowledge on the subject of nutrition, the information provided should be simple and easily understood; 
Whereas application of this Directive for a certain length of time will enable valuable experience on the subject to be gained and consumer reaction to the way in which nutrition information is presented to be evaluated thus enabling the Commission to review the rules and propose any appropriate amendments; 
Whereas in order to encourage interested parties, especially small and medium-sized undertakings, to provide nutrition labelling for as many products as possible, measures to make information more complete and more balanced should be introduced gradually; 
Whereas the rules laid down in this Directive should also take into account the Codex Altimentarius guidelines on nutrition labelling; 
Whereas general labelling provisions and definitions are contained in Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer (4), as last amended by Directive 89/395/EEC (5); whereas this Directive can therefore be confined to those provisions pertaining to nutrition labelling, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
1. This Directive concerns nutrition labelling of foodstuffs to be delivered as such to the ultimate consumer. It shall also apply to foodstuffs intended for supply to restaurants, hospitals, canteens and other similar mass caterers (hereinafter referred to as 'mass caterers'). 
2. This Directive shall not apply to: 
- natural mineral waters or other waters intended for human consumption, 
- diet integrators/food supplements. 
3. This Directive shall apply without prejudice to the labelling provisions of Council Directive 89/398/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses (3) and specific Directives as referred to in Article 4 of that Directive. 
4. For the purposes of this Directive: 
(a) 'nutrition labelling' means any information appearing on labelling and relating to: 
(i) energy value; 
(ii) the following nutrients: 
- protein, 
- carbohydrate, 
- fat, 
- fibre, 
- sodium, 
- vitamins and minerals listed in the Annex and present in significant amounts as defined in that Annex. 
Changes to the list of vitamins, minerals and their recommended daily allowances shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10; 
(b) 'nutrition claim' means any representation and any advertising message which states, suggests or implies that a foodstuff has particular nutrition properties due to the energy (calorific value) it 
- provides, 
- provides at a reduced or increased rate or 
- does not provide, 
and/or due to the nutrients it 
- contains, 
- contains in reduced or increased proportions or 
- does not contain. 
A reference to qualities or quantities of a nutrient does not constitute a nutrition claim in so far as it is required by legislation. 
In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10, it may be decided in certain cases whether the conditions described in this point are satisfied; 
(c) 'protein' means the protein content calculated using the formula: protein = total Kjeldahl nitrogen Ã— 6,25; 
(d) 'carbohydrate' means any carbohydrate which is metabolized in man, and includes polyols; 
(e) 'sugars' means all monosaccharides and disaccharides present in food, but excludes polyols; 
(f) 'fat' means total lipids, and includes phospholipids; 
(g) 'saturates' means fatty acids without double bond; 
(h) 'mono-unsaturates' means fatty acids with one cis double bond; 
(i) 'polyunsaturates' means fatty acids with cis, cis-methylene interrupted double bonds; 
(j) 'fibre' means the material to be defined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10 and measured by the method of analysis to be determined in accordance with that procedure; 
(k) 'average value' means the value which best represents the amount of the nutrient which a given food contains, and reflects allowances for seasonal variability, patterns of consumption and other factors which may cause the actual value to vary. 
Article 2 
1. Subject to paragraph 2, nutrition labelling shall be optional. 
2. Where a nutrition claim appears on labelling, in presentation or in advertising, with the exclusion of generic advertising, nutrition labelling shall be compulsory. 
Article 3 
The only nutrition claims permitted shall be those relating to energy, to the nutrients listed in Article 1 (4) (a) (ii) and to substances which belong to or which are components of a category of those nutrients. Provisions restricting or prohibiting nutrition claims within the meaning of this Article may be adopted by the procedure laid down in Article 10. 
Article 4 
1. Where nutrition labelling is provided, the information to be given shall consist of either group 1 or group 2 in the following order: 
Group 1 
(a) energy value; 
(b) the amounts of protein, carbohydrate and fat. 
Group 2 
(a) energy value; 
(b) the amounts of protein, carbohydrate, sugars, fat, saturates, fibre and sodium. 
2. Where a nutrition claim is made for sugars, saturates, fibre or sodium, the information to be given shall consist of group 2. 
3. Nutrition labelling may also include the amounts of one or more of the following: 
- starch, 
- polyols, 
- mono-unsaturates, 
- polyunsaturates, 
- cholesterol, 
- any of the minerals or vitamins listed in the Annex and present in significant amounts as defined in that Annex.

In addition, where the amount of polyunsaturates and/or mono-unsaturates and/or the cholesterol rate is given, the amount of saturates shall also be given, the declaration of the latter not constituting - in this case - a nutrition claim within the meaning of paragraph 2. 
Article 5 
1. The energy value to be declared shall be calculated using the following conversion factors: 
- carbohydrate (except polyols) 4 kcal/g - 17 kJ/g 
- polyols 2,4 kcal/g - 10 kJ/g 
- protein 4 kcal/g - 17 kJ/g 
- fat 9 kcal/g - 37 kJ/g 
- alcohol (ethanol) 7 kcal/g - 29 kJ/g
