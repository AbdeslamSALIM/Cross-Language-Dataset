THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1706/98 of 20 July 1998 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 715/90 (1), and in particular Article 30(1) thereof, 
Whereas pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1706/98 certain products listed in Annex A to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (2), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 923/96 (3), are imported into the Community free of customs duties; whereas the other products listed in the above Annex and in Article 1(1)(c) of Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2072/98 (5), are imported into the Community at a reduced rate of duty provided they originate in the ACP States; 
Whereas the detailed rules for the application of such arrangements to products falling within CN codes 0714 10 91 and 0714 90 11 should be limited to imposing an obligation to import the product at zero duty or at the reduced rate from the ACP State indicated in the import licence, and to setting up a regular notification system; 
Whereas, pursuant to Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1706/98, customs duties are not applied to direct imports into the French overseas departments of products falling within CN codes 0714 10 91 and 0714 90 11 and originating in the ACP States and overseas countries and territories within the limit of an annual quota of 2 000 tonnes; whereas the detailed rules for the application of such arrangements should relate to the lodging of applications for import licences and the issue of such licences and guarantee direct importation into the French overseas departments and observance of the maximum quantity laid down; whereas, in order to comply with the objective of the measure and ensure the management and supervision of the tariff quota, the use of licences for release for free circulation into the above departments should be strictly limited; 
Whereas these detailed rules either supplement or derogate from, as the case may be, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1044/98 (7), or Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 of 23 May 1995 on special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice (8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/98 (9); 
Whereas, so that the actual use made of licences can be monitored better, the provision in Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 on early submission of proof of release for free circulation should apply; 
Whereas the partial reimbursement of import duties resulting from the reduction in duties applicable from 1 January 1996 is to be carried out in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 82/97 (11), and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1677/98 (13); 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2245/90 of 31 July 1990 laying down detailed rules for the application of the import arrangements applicable to products falling within CN codes 0714 10 91 and 0714 90 11 and originating in the ACP States or in the overseas countries and territories (14), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1431/97 (15), should be repealed; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
