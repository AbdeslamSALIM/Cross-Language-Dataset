(2005/C 195/06) 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 88/97 [1] of 20 January 1997 (the "exemption Regulation") authorises the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty on imports of certain bicycle parts originating in the People's Republic of China. This duty resulted from the extension by Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97 [2] of the anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93 [3] and maintained by Council Regulation (EC) No 1524/2000 [4]. 
In this framework, and by successive Commission Decisions, a certain number of bicycle producers have been exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty: inter alia, F.lli Masciaghi SpA, Italy (Taric additional code 8067) [5], Field SA, Greece (Taric additional code 8034) [6], Bottecchia Cicli Srl, Italy (Taric additional code A087) [7], Fabbrica Biciclette Trubbiani e C. SNC, Italy (Taric additional code A232) [8], and, Family Bike Srl, Italy (Taric additional code A254) [9]. 
Furthermore, by Commission Notice of 22 April 2004 [10], references to Bottecchia Cicli Srl, Via dell'Industria 7, I-35028 Piove di Sacco (PD), were changed into Bottecchia Cicli Srl, Via Matteotti 26, I-35020 Arzergrande (PD). 
F.lli Masciaghi SpA, Italy, has informed the Commission that the legal address of the company has changed from Via Santa Maria in Campo, 1, I-20040 Cavenago Brianza (MI), to Via Gramsci, 10, I-20052 Monza (MI). 
Field SA has informed the Commission that the legal form and address of the company that carries out the assembly operation and consequently requires the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty have changed from Field SA, 32 Olympou Street, EL-57 009 Kalochori, Thessaloniki, to Field ABEE, Industrial Area of Thessaloniki, A5 Road, EL-57 022 Sindos. 
Bottecchia Cicli Srl has informed the Commission that the legal address of the company has changed from Via Matteotti 26, I-35020 Arzergrande (PD) to Viale Enzo Ferrari, 15/17, I-30014 Cavarzere (VE). 
Fabbrica Biciclette Trubbiani e C. SNC, Santa Maria in Selva Via Arno, 1, I-62010 Treia (MC), has informed the Commission that the legal denomination of the company that carries out the assembly operation and consequently requires the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty is now Fabbrica Biciclette Trubbiani Srl with the same legal address. 
Family Bike Srl has informed the Commission that the legal name and address of the company that carries out the assembly operation and consequently requires the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty have changed from Family Bike Srl, Via Serenissima 6, I-36041 Montecchio Maggiore (VI) to Veneta Tecnologie Srl, Via Serenissima 4, I-36075 Montecchio Maggiore (VI). 
The Commission, after having examined the information supplied, has established that the changes in the companies' names and legal addresses do not affect the assembly operations with regards to the stipulations of the exemption Regulation and therefore the Commission does not consider that these changes should affect the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty.
