Regulation (EC) No 1161/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6&amp;nbsp;July 2005 on the compilation of quarterly non-financial accounts by institutional sector 
Regulation (EC) No 1161/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 6 July 2005 
on the compilation of quarterly non-financial accounts by institutional sector 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank [1], 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2], 
Whereas: 
(1) The Action Plan on Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) Statistical Requirements endorsed by the Ecofin Council in September 2000 specifies that a limited set of quarterly sector accounts is urgently needed, and that these should be available within 90 days of the end of the quarter concerned. 
(2) The Joint Report of the Ecofin Council and the Commission to the European Council on Eurozone statistics and indicators, as adopted by the Ecofin Council on 18 February 2003, emphasises that high priority actions in several fields, including quarterly national accounts by institutional sector, should be fully implemented by 2005. 
(3) The analysis of cyclical movements in the European Union economy and the conduct of monetary policy within the EMU require macroeconomic statistics on the economic behaviour and the interrelationship of individual institutional sectors which are impossible to identify in data compiled at the level of the economy as a whole. There is, therefore, a need to produce quarterly accounts by institutional sector, for the European Union as a whole and for the euro area. 
(4) Production of these accounts is part of the overall aim to compile a system of annual and quarterly accounts for the European Union and for the euro area. The system includes the main macroeconomic aggregates and the financial and non-financial accounts by institutional sector. The aim is to achieve consistency across all these accounts and, with regard to the rest of the world accounts, between the balance of payments and the national accounts data. 
(5) The compilation of European accounts by institutional sector, in accordance with the principles of the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 [3], requires the transmission by Member States of quarterly national accounts by institutional sector. However, the European accounts must reflect the economy of the European area as a whole and may differ from the simple aggregation of Member States√¢&#x20AC;&#x2122; accounts. In particular, the objective is to take account of the transactions of the institutions and bodies of the European Union in the accounts of the area concerned (the European Union or the euro-zone, whichever is applicable). 
(6) The production of specific Community statistics is governed by the rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics [4]. 
(7) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the compilation of quarterly non-financial accounts by institutional sector for the European Union and the euro area, cannot be achieved satisfactorily by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective. In particular, where Member States make a negligible contribution to the European totals, they should not be required to report the full detail of data. 
(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [5]. 
(9) The Statistical Programme Committee set up by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom [6] and the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics set up by Council Decision 91/115/EEC [7] have been consulted, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
