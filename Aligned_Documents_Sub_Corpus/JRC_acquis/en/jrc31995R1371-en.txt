COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1371/95 of 16 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the egg sector 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in eggs (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden and by Regulation (EEC) No 3290/94 (2), and in particular Articles 3 (2), 8 (12) and 15 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 of 22 December 1994 on the adjustments and transitional arrangements required in the agricultural sector in order to implement the agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, and in particular Article 3 (1) thereof, 
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides that from 1 July 1995 all exports for which export refunds are requested, with the exception of exports of hatching eggs, shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence with advance fixing of the refund; whereas therefore specific implementing rules should be laid down for the egg sector which should, in particular, include provisions for the submission of the applications and the information which must appear on the applications and licences, in addition to those contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing licences for agricultural products (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1199/95 (4); 
Whereas, in order to assure proper administration of the system, the rate of the security for export licences under the said system should be fixed; whereas in view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in the egg sector, export licences should not be transferable and precise conditions governing access by traders to the said system should be laid down; 
Whereas Article 8 (12) of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides that compliance with the obligations arising from agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations regarding the export volume shall be ensured on the basis of the export licences; whereas therefore a detailed schedule for the lodging of applications and for the issuing of licences should be laid down; 
Whereas, in addition, the decision regarding applications for export licences should be communicated only after a period of consideration; whereas this period would allow the Commission to appreciate the quantities applied for as well as the expenditure involved and, if appropriate, to take specific measures applicable in particular to the applications which are pending; whereas it is in the interest of trader to allow the licence application to be withdrawn after the acceptance coefficient has been fixed; 
Whereas, in the case of applications concerning quantities equal to or less than 25 tonnes, the export licence should be issued immediately if the trader requests it; whereas these licences, however, should benefit from refunds only in accordance with the measures which the Commission might possibly have taken for the period in question; 
Whereas in order to ensure an exact follow up of the quantities to be exported, a derogation from the rules regarding the tolerances laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 should be laid down; 
Whereas the Commission must dispose of precise information concerning applications for licences and of the use of licences issued, in order to be able to manage this system; whereas, in the interest of efficient administration, the notifications from Member States to the Commission should be made according to a uniform model; 
Whereas to avoid any interruption of exports at the time of entry into force of the Agreement on Agriculture of the Uruguay Round, authorization should be given for export licences to be applied for and issued before the date of the entry into force of this Agreement, but for use after that date; 
Whereas Article 8 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides that for hatching eggs export refunds may be granted on the basis of an ex post export licence; whereas therefore implementing rules for such a system should be laid down with the aim of ensuring efficient verification with the obligations arising from the agreements concluded in the framework of the Uruguay Round negotiations are complied with; whereas, however, it would appear unnecessary to require the lodging of a security in the case of licences applied for after exportation; 
Whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 572/73 of 26 February 1973 establishing egg and poultrymeat products eligible for the advance fixing of export refunds (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3501/93 (2), and of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3652/81 of 18 December 1981 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of advance fixing certificates for refunds in the poultrymeat and eggs sector (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1030/95 (4), were repealed by the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1372/95 (5) as from the date of entry into force of the Agreement on Agriculture of the Uruguay Round; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1
