2. If a Member State has reasons to believe that landings or imports of Dissostichus spp. declared as having been caught on the high seas outside the CCAMLR area consist in actual fact of Dissostichus spp. caught in the CCAMLR area, the Member State shall request the Flag State to carry out an additional verification of the catch document by the use of, inter alia, data reports provided through an automated satellite-linked VMS.
