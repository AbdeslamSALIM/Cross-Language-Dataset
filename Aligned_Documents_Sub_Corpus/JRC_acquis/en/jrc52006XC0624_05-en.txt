Proof of origin Manufacturing undertakings listed in the register held by the Regulatory Board are subject to regular inspections to monitor compliance with the requirements for registration. 
During inspections, information is gathered on the manufacturing process, the raw materials used (for which samples can be taken), the production and storage of the product and production volumes. 
Registered manufacturing undertakings must submit an application on an official form for the certification of each production batch to enable the Regulatory Board to take the required samples. 
To receive certification, a production batch must fulfil the administrative, technical and regulatory requirements laid down in the product specification. The Regulatory Board will decide whether or not to certify the batch on the basis of a dossier containing the findings of the inspections, the analysis results and other documentation held in its files. 
After certification, the product is marketed under the control of the Regulatory Board. Each package bears the secondary label of the PGI, showing, in addition to the name %quot%Alfajor de Medina Sidonia%quot% and the logo, a unique serial number. 
Method of production : 
The product is manufactured using a recipe that has been used in the town for centuries. The process starts with heating the honey. When the correct temperature has been reached, the almonds and hazelnuts (chopped and roasted), breadcrumbs, flour, the roasted sesame and the coriander, cloves and aniseed (roasted and crushed) are added. The ingredients are mixed together and the resulting dough is then cut, while still warm, and the mixture allowed to cool to room temperature before being shaped into the elongated cylinders characteristic of %quot%Alfajor de Medina Sidonia%quot%. It is permitted to add cinnamon to the warm dough. 
Finally, the pieces of dough are dipped in syrup and coated with sugar and cinnamon powder before being wrapped and packaged.
