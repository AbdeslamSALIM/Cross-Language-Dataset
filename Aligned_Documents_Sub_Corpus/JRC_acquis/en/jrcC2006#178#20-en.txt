Order of the Court (Fourth Chamber) of 30 May 2006 — (reference for a preliminary ruling from the Cour de cassation, Belgium) — Criminal proceedings against Sébastien Victor Leroy 
(Case C-435/04) [1] 
Referring court 
Cour de cassation 
Criminal proceedings against 
Sébastien Victor Leroy 
Action 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Cour de cassation, Belgium — Interpretation of Articles 49 to 55 of the EC Treaty with regard to national legislation prohibiting, on pain of criminal penalties, a person who resides and works in the national territory from using a vehicle which belongs to a leasing company established in another Member State and registered in that State 
Operative part of the judgment 
Articles 49 EC to 55 EC do not preclude the domestic legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, from prohibiting a person who resides and works in that State from using, in that State, a vehicle which he has rented from a leasing company established in another Member State, when that vehicle has not been registered in the first State and it is intended that it should be used there essentially on a permanent basis or is, in fact, used in that manner.
