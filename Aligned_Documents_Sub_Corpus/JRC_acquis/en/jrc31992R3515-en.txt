COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3515/92 of 4 December 1992 laying down common detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1055/77 on the storage and movement of products bought in by an intervention agency 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1055/77 of 17 May 1977 on the storage and movement of products bought in by an intervention agency (1), and in particular Article 4 thereof, 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/77 (2) as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3826/85 (3) lays down common detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1055/77; whereas in connection with the abolition of controls and formalities at the internal frontiers and for reasons of clarity and administrative efficiency, the rules concerned should be redrafted; whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1722/77 should accordingly be repealed; 
Whereas the competent authorities are informed of all trade in the products in question; whereas, therefore, for the sake of administrative simplicity it is desirable that a licence should not be required in respect of products held by an intervention agency which are exported to a non-member country for storage there or returned to the Member State of departure; 
Whereas the export of intervention products for storage in a third country is to be considered an export as referred to in Article 3 (2) (c) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2726/90 of 17 September 1990 on Community transit (4);
