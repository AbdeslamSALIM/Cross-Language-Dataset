Whereas: 
(1) Article 11(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 stipulates that products which are imported from a third country may be marketed only where they originate from a third country appearing in a list drawn up in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 11(2) of the Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91.
