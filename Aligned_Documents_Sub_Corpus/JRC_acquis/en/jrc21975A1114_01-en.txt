2. However, to prevent abuses, customs authorities may in exceptional cases, and particularly when irregularity is suspected, carry out an examination of the goods at such offices. 
CHAPTER II ISSUE OF TIR CARNETS Liability of guaranteeing associations 
Article 6 
1. Subject to such conditions and guarantees as it shall determine, each Contracting Party may authorize associations to issue TIR carnets, either directly or through corresponding associations, and to act as guarantors. 
2. An association shall not be approved in any country unless its guarantee also covers the liabilities incurred in that country in connection with operations under cover of TIR carnets issued by foreign associations affiliated to the same international organization as that to which it is itself affiliated. 
Article 7 
TIR carnet forms sent to the guaranteeing associations by the corresponding foreign associations or by international organizations shall not be liable to import and export duties and taxes and shall be free of import and export prohibitions and restrictions. 
Article 8 
1. The guaranteeing association shall undertake to pay the import or export duties and taxes, together with any default interest, due under the customs laws and regulations of the country in which an irregularity has been noted in connection with a TIR operation. It shall be liable, jointly and severally with the persons from whom the sums mentioned above are due, for payment of such sums. 
2. In cases where the laws and regulations of a Contracting Party do not provide for payment of import or export duties and taxes as provided for in paragraph 1 above, the guaranteeing association shall undertake to pay, under the same conditions, a sum equal to the amount of the import or export duties and taxes and any default interest. 
3. Each Contracting Party shall determine the maximum sum per TIR carnet, which may be claimed from the guaranteeing association on the basis of the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 above. 
4. The liability of the guaranteeing association to the authorities of the country where the customs office of departure is situated shall commence at the time when the TIR carnet is accepted by the customs office. In the succeeding countries through which goods are transported under the TIR procedure, this liability shall commence at the time when the goods are imported or, where the TIR operation has been suspended under Article 26 (1) and (2), at the time when the TIR carnet is accepted by the customs office where the TIR operation is resumed. 
5. The liability of the guaranteeing association shall cover not only the goods which are enumerated in the TIR carnet but also any goods which, though not enumerated therein, may be contained in the sealed section of the road vehicle or in the sealed container. It shall not extend to any other goods. 
6. For the purpose of determining the duties and taxes mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, the particulars of the goods as entered in the TIR carnet shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be assumed to be correct. 
7. When payment of sums mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article becomes due, the competent authorities shall so far as possible require payment from the person or persons directly liable before making a claim against the guaranteeing association. 
Article 9 
1. The guaranteeing association shall fix the period of validity of the TIR carnet by specifying a final date of validity after which the carnet may not be presented for acceptance at the customs office of departure. 
2. Provided that it has been accepted by the customs office of departure on or before the final date of validity as provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article, the carnet shall remain valid until the termination of the TIR operation at the customs office of destination. 
Article 10 
1. The TIR carnet may be discharged unconditionally or conditionally ; where discharge is conditional this shall be on account of facts connected with the TIR operation itself. These facts shall be clearly indicated in the TIR carnet. 
2. When the customs authorities of a country have discharged a TIR carnet unconditionally they can no longer claim from the guaranteeing association payment of the sums mentioned in Article 8 (1) and (2) unless the certificate of discharge was obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner. 
Article 11 
1. Where a TIR carnet has not been discharged or has been discharged conditionally, the competent authorities shall not have the right to claim payment of the sums mentioned in Article 8 (1) and (2) from the guaranteeing association unless, within a period of one year from the date of acceptance of the TIR carnet by those authorities, they have notified the association in writing of the non-discharge or conditional discharge. The same provision shall apply where the certificate of discharge was obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner, save that the period shall be two years. 
2. The claim for payment of the sums referred to in Article 8 (1) and (2) shall be made to the guaranteeing association at the earliest three months after the date on which the association was informed that the carnet had not been discharged or had been discharged conditionally or that the certificate of discharge had been obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner and at the latest not more than two years after that date. However, in cases which, during the abovementioned period of two years, become the subject of legal proceedings, any claim for payment shall be made within one year of the date on which the decision of the court becomes enforceable. 
3. The guaranteeing association shall have a period of three months, from the date when a claim for payment is made upon it, in which to pay the amounts claimed. The sums paid shall be reimbursed to the association if, within the two years following the date on which the claim for payment was made, it has been established to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that no irregularity was committed in connection with the transport operation in question.

Nevertheless, Contracting Parties shall avoid delaying traffic when the defects found are of minor importance and do not involve any risk of smuggling.

Article 16 
When a road vehicle or combination of vehicles is carrying out a TIR operation, one rectangular plate bearing the inscription %quot%TIR%quot% and conforming to the specifications given in Annex 5 to this Convention shall be affixed to the front and another to the rear of the road vehicle or combination of vehicles.

The said customs authorities may, however, if control requirements make it necessary, add their own seals. 
2. The customs seals thus accepted by a Contracting Party shall have in the territory of that Contracting Party the benefit of the same legal protection as is accorded to the national seals. 
Article 23

When transport under cover of a TIR carnet takes place in part in the territory of a State which is not a Contracting Party to this Convention, the TIR operation shall be suspended during that part of the journey. In that case, the customs authorities of the Contracting Party on whose territory the journey continues shall accept the TIR carnet for the resumption of the TIR operation, provided that the customs seals and/or identifying marks have remained intact. 
2. The same shall apply where for a part of the journey the TIR carnet is not used by the holder of the carnet in the territory of a Contracting Party because of the existence of simpler customs transit procedures or when the use of a customs transit regime is not necessary. 
3. In such cases the customs offices where the TIR operation is suspended or resumed shall be deemed to be customs offices of exit en route and customs offices of entry en route respectively.

ANNEX 2 REGULATIONS ON TECHNICAL CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO ROAD VEHICLES WHICH MAY BE ACCEPTED FOR INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT UNDER CUSTOMS SEAL 
Article 1 
Basic principles 
Approval for the international transport of goods under customs seal may be granted only to vehicles, the load compartments of which are constructed and equipped in such a manner that: (a) no goods can be removed from, or introduced into, the sealed part of the vehicle without leaving obvious traces of tampering or without breaking the customs seal; 
(b) customs seals can be simply and effectively affixed to them; 
(c) they contain no concealed spaces where goods may be hidden; 
(d) all spaces capable of holding goods are readily accessible for customs inspection. 
Article 2 
Structure of load compartments 
1. To meet the requirements of Article 1 of these Regulations: (a) the constituent parts of the load compartment (sides, floor, doors, roof, uprights, frames, cross-pieces, etc.) shall be assembled either by means of devices which cannot be removed and replaced from the outside without leaving obvious traces or by such methods as will produce a structure which cannot be modified without leaving obvious traces. When the sides, floor, doors and roof are made up of various components, these shall meet the same requirements and be of sufficient strength; 
(b) doors and all other closing systems (including stopcocks, manhole-covers, flanges, etc.) shall be fitted with a device on which customs seals can be fixed. This device must be such that it cannot be removed and replaced from the outside without leaving obvious traces, or the door or fastening be opened without breaking the customs seals. The latter shall be adequately protected. Opening roofs shall be permitted; 
(c) apertures for ventilation and drainage shall be provided with a device preventing access to the interior of the load compartment. This device must be such that it cannot be removed and replaced from the outside without leaving obvious traces. 
2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1 (c) of these Regulations, constituent parts of the load compartment which, for practical reasons, have to include empty spaces (for example, between the partitions of a double wall) shall be permitted. In order that the said spaces cannot be used to conceal goods: (i) where it covers the full height from floor to roof, or, in other cases, where the space between it and the outer wall is completely enclosed, the lining inside the load compartment shall be so fitted that it cannot be removed and replaced without leaving obvious traces, and 
(ii) where a lining is of less than full height and the spaces between the lining and the outer wall are not completely enclosed, and in all other cases where spaces occur in the construction of a load compartment, the number of such spaces shall be kept to a minimum and these spaces shall be readily accessible for customs inspection. 
3. Windows shall be allowed provided that they are made of materials of sufficient strength and that they cannot be removed and replaced from the outside without leaving obvious traces. Glass shall nevertheless be permitted, but in this case the window shall be fitted with a fixed metal grille which cannot be removed from the outside ; the mesh of the grille shall not exceed 10 mm. 
4. Openings made in the floor for technical purposes, such as lubrication, maintenance and filling of the sandbox, shall be allowed only on condition that they are fitted with a cover capable of being fixed in such a way as to render the load compartment inaccessible from the outside. 
Article 3 
Sheeted vehicles 
1. Where applicable, the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of these Regulations shall apply to sheeted vehicles. In addition, these vehicles shall conform to the provisions of this Article. 
2. The sheet shall be either of strong canvas or of plastic-covered or rubberized cloth, which shall be of sufficient strength and unstretchable. It shall be in good condition and made up in such a way that once the closing device has been secured, it is impossible to gain access to the load compartment without leaving obvious traces. 
3. If the sheet is made up of several pieces, their edges shall be folded into one another and sewn together with two seams at least 15 mm apart. These seams shall be made as shown in Sketch No 1 appended to these Regulations ; however, where in the case of certain parts of the sheet (such as flaps and reinforced corners) it is not possible to assemble the pieces in that way, it shall be sufficient to fold the edge of the top section and make the seams as shown in Sketch No 2 or 2 (a) appended to these Regulations. One of the seams shall be visible only from the inside and the colour of the thread used for that seam shall be clearly different from the colour of the sheet itself and from the colour of the thread used for the other seam. All seams shall be machine-sewn. 
4. If the sheet is of plastic-covered cloth, and is made up of several pieces, the pieces may alternatively be welded together in the manner shown in Sketch No 3 appended to these Regulations. The edges of the pieces shall overlap by at least 15 mm. The pieces shall be fused together over the whole width of the overlap. The edge of the outer sheet shall be covered with a band of plastic material at least 7 mm wide, affixed by the same welding process. The plastic band and the sheet on each side of it for a width of at least 3 mm shall have a clearly-defined uniform relief pattern stamped on them. The pieces shall be welded in such a way that they cannot be separated and rejoined without leaving obvious traces. 
5. Repairs shall be made in accordance with the method described in Sketch No 4 appended to these Regulations ; the edges shall be folded into one another and sewn together with two visible seams at least 15 mm apart ; the colour of the thread visible from the inside shall be different from that of the thread visible from the outside and from that of the sheet itself ; all seams shall be machine-sewn. When a sheet which has been damaged near the edges is repaired by replacing the damaged part by a patch, the seam can also be made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article and Sketch No 1 appended to these Regulations. Sheets of plastic-covered cloth may alternatively be repaired in accordance with the method described in paragraph 4 of this Article, but in that case the plastic band must be affixed to both sides of the sheet, the patch being fitted on the inside of the sheet. 
6. 
(a) The sheet shall be fixed to the vehicle in strict compliance with the conditions set forth in Article 1 (a) and (b) of these Regulations. The following types of fastening shall be provided: (i) metal rings fixed to the vehicles, 
(ii) eyelets let into the edge of the sheet, 
(iii) a fastening passing through the rings above the sheet and visible from the outside for its entire length. 
The sheet shall overlap solid parts of the vehicle by at least 250 mm, measured from the centre of the securing rings, unless the system of construction of the vehicle in itself prevents all access to the load compartment. 
(b) When any edge of a sheet is to be permanently secured to a vehicle, the two surfaces shall be joined together without a break and shall be held in place by strong devices. 
7. The sheet shall be supported by an adequate superstructure (uprights, sides, arches, slats, etc.). 
8. The spaces between the rings and the spaces between the eyelets shall not exceed 200 mm. The eyelets shall be reinforced. 
9. The following fastenings shall be used: (a) steel wire ropes of at least 3 mm diameter ; or 
(b) ropes of hemp or sisal of at least 8 mm diameter encased in a transparent sheath of unstretchable plastic. 
Wire ropes may have a transparent sheath of unstretchable plastic. 
10. Each rope shall be in one piece and have a hard metal end-piece at each end. The fastener of each metal end-piece shall include a hollow rivet passing through the rope so as to allow the introduction of the thread or strap of the customs seal. The rope shall remain visible on either side of the hollow rivet so that it is possible to ensure that the rope is in one piece (see Sketch No 5 appended to these Regulations). 
11. At the openings in the sheet, used for loading and unloading, the two edges of the sheet shall have an adequate overlap. They shall also be fastened by: (a) a flap sewn or welded in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article; 
(b) rings and eyelets meeting the conditions of paragraph 8 of this Article ; and 
(c) a thong made of appropriate material, in one piece and unstretchable, at least 20 mm wide and 3 mm thick, passing through the rings and holding together the two edges of the sheet and the flap ; the thong shall be secured inside the sheet and fitted with an eyelet to take the rope mentioned in paragraph 9 of this Article. 
A flap shall not be required if a special device, such as a baffle plate, is fitted, which prevents access to the load compartment without leaving obvious traces.

ANNEX 3 PROCEDURE FOR THE APPROVAL OF ROAD VEHICLES COMPLYING WITH THE TECHNICAL CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE REGULATIONS CONTAINED IN ANNEX 2 
General 
1. Road vehicles may be approved by one of the following procedures: (a) individually ; or 
(b) by design type (series of road vehicles). 
2. An approval certificate conforming to the standard form of Annex 4 shall be issued for approved vehicles. This certificate shall be printed in the language of the country of issue and in French or English. When the authority which has granted the approval deems it necessary, photographs or diagrams authenticated by that authority shall be attached to the certificate. The number of those documents shall then be inserted by that authority under item 6 of the approval certificate. 
3. The approval certificate shall be kept on the road vehicle. 
4. Road vehicles shall be produced every two years, for the purposes of inspection and of renewal of approval, where appropriate, to the competent authorities of the country in which the vehicle is registered or, in the case of unregistered vehicles, of the country in which the owner or user is resident. 
5. If a road vehicle no longer complies with the technical conditions prescribed for its approval, it shall, before it can be used for the transport of goods under cover of TIR carnets, be restored to the condition which had justified its approval so as to comply again with the said technical conditions. 
6. If the essential characteristics of a road vehicle are changed, the vehicle shall cease to be covered by the approval and shall be reapproved by the competent authority before it can be used for the transport of goods under cover of TIR carnets. 
7. The competent authorities of the country of registration of the vehicle or, in the case of vehicles for which registration is not required, the competent authorities of the country where the owner or user of the vehicle is established may, as the case may be, withdraw or renew the approval certificate or issue a new approval certificate in the circumstances set out in Article 14 of this Convention and in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this Annex. 
Procedure for individual approval 
8. The owner, the operator or the representative of either shall apply to the competent authority for individual approval. The competent authority shall inspect the road vehicle produced in accordance with the general rules laid down in paragraphs 1 to 7 above and shall satisfy itself that the vehicle complies with the technical conditions prescribed in Annex 2, and after approval shall issue a certificate conforming to the model in Annex 4. 
Procedure for approval by design type (series of road vehicles) 
9. Where road vehicles are manufactured by type series, the manufacturer may apply to the competent authority of the country of manufacture for approval by design-type. 
10. The manufacturer shall state in his application the identification numbers or letters which he assigns to the type of road vehicle to which his application for approval relates. 
11. The application shall be accompanied by drawings and a detailed design specification of the type of road vehicle to be approved. 
12. The manufacturer shall give an undertaking in writing that he will: (a) produce to the competent authority such vehicles of the type concerned as that authority may wish to examine; 
(b) permit the competent authority to examine further units at any time during the production of the type series concerned; 
(c) advise the competent authority of any change, however small, in the design or specification before proceeding with such change; 
(d) mark the road vehicles in a visible place with the identification numbers or letters of the design-type and the serial number of the vehicle in the type series (manufacturer's number); 
(e) keep a record of vehicles manufactured to the approved design-type. 
13. The competent authority shall state what changes, if any, must be made to the proposed design-type in order that approval may be granted. 
14. No approval by design-type shall be granted unless the competent authority has satisfied itself by examination of one or more vehicles manufactured to the design-type concerned that vehicles of that type comply with the technical conditions prescribed in Annex 2. 
15. The competent authority shall notify the manufacturer in writing of its decision to grant approval by design-type. This decision shall be dated and numbered. The authority which took the decision shall be clearly designated. 
16. The competent authority shall take the necessary steps to issue an approval certificate, which it has duly signed, in respect of every vehicle built in conformity with an approved design-type. 
17. The holder of the approval certificate shall, before using the vehicle for the carriage of goods under the cover of a TIR carnet, fill in, as may be required, on the approval certificate: - the registration number given to the vehicle (item 1) or, 
- in the case of a vehicle not subject to registration, particulars of his name and business address (item 8). 
18. When a vehicle which has been approved by design-type is exported to another country which is a Contracting Party to this Convention, no further approval procedure shall be required in that country on account of its importation. 
Procedure for endorsement of the certificate of approval 
19. When an approved vehicle, carrying goods under cover of a TIR carnet, is found to have major defects, the competent authorities of Contracting Parties may either refuse to allow the vehicle to continue its journey under a TIR carnet, or allow the vehicle to continue its journey under a TIR carnet on its territory while taking the necessary security precautions. The approved vehicle must be restored to a satisfactory state as rapidly as possible, and in any case before it is again used for the transport of goods under cover of a TIR carnet. 
20. In each of these cases the customs authorities shall make an appropriate endorsement in item 10 of the certificate of approval of the vehicle. When the vehicle has been restored to a condition which justifies approval, it shall be presented to the competent authorities of a Contracting Party who shall revalidate the certificate by adding an endorsement to item 11 cancelling the earlier observations. No vehicle, the certificate of which has been endorsed at item 10 under the provisions of the preceding paragraph, may again be used for the transport of goods under a TIR carnet until it has been restored to a satisfactory condition and until the endorsement in item 10 has been cancelled as stated above. 
21. Each endorsement made on the certificate shall be dated and authenticated by the competent authorities. 
22. When a vehicle is found to have defects which the customs authorities consider to be of minor importance and not involving the risk of smuggling, the continued use of the vehicle for the transport of goods under cover of a TIR carnet can be authorized. The holder of the approval certificate shall be notified of the defects and shall restore his vehicle to a satisfactory state within a reasonable time.

ANNEX 6 EXPLANATORY NOTES 
INTRODUCTION 
(i) In accordance with the provisions of Article 43 of this Convention, the Explanatory Notes interpret certain provisions of this Convention and of its Annexes. They also describe certain recommended practices. 
(ii) The Explanatory Notes do not modify the provisions of this Convention or of its Annexes but merely make their contents, meaning and scope more precise. 
(iii) In particular, having regard to the provisions of Article 12 of this Convention and of Annex 2 relating to the technical conditions for the approval of road vehicles for transport under customs seal, the Explanatory Notes specify, where appropriate, the construction techniques to be accepted by the Contracting Parties as complying with those provisions. The Explanatory Notes also specify, where appropriate, which construction techniques do not comply with those provisions. 
(iv) The Explanatory Notes provide a means of applying the provisions of this Convention and of its Annexes so as to take into account the development of technology and economic requirements. 
0. MAIN TEXT OF THE CONVENTION 
0.1. Article 1 
0.1. (b) The fees and charges excepted in Article 1 (b) mean all sums, other than import or export duties and taxes, levied by Contracting Parties on or in connection with importation or exportation. These sums shall be limited in amount to the approximate cost of the services rendered and shall not represent an indirect protection to domestic products or a tax on imports or exports for fiscal purposes. Such fees and charges include inter alia payments relating to: - certificates of origin if they are required for transit, 
- analyses carried out by customs laboratories for control purposes, 
- customs inspections and other clearance operations carried out outside normal working hours or away from customs offices, 
- inspections for sanitary, veterinary or phytopathological reasons. 
0.1.(e) The term %quot%demountable body%quot% means a load compartment which has no means of locomotion and which is designed to be transported upon a road vehicle, the chassis of which, together with the under-framing of the body, is specially adapted for this purpose. 
0.1.(e)(i) The term %quot%partially enclosed%quot%, as applied to equipment in Article 1 (e) (i), relates to equipment generally consisting of a floor and a superstructure marking off a loading space equivalent to that of a closed container. The superstructure is generally made up of metal members forming the frame of a container. Containers of this type may also comprise one or more lateral or frontal walls. In some cases there is only a roof attached to the floor by uprights. This type of container is used in particular for the transport of bulky goods (motor cars, for example). 
0.2. Article 2 
0.2-1. Article 2 provides that a transport operation under cover of a TIR carnet may begin and end in the same country on condition that part of the journey is performed in foreign territory. In such cases there is nothing to prevent the customs authorities of the country of departure from requiring, in addition to the TIR carnet, a national document, intended to ensure duty-free re-importation of the goods. It is nevertheless recommended that customs authorities should not insist on the use of such a document but accept instead an appropriate endorsement on the TIR carnet. 
0.2-2. The provisions of this Article allow goods to be carried under cover of a TIR carnet when only part of the journey is made by road. They do not specify what part of the journey has to be made by road and it is sufficient that this should occur at some point between the beginning and the end of the TIR operation. However, it may happen that, for unforeseen reasons of a commercial or accidental nature, no part of the journey can be made by road, despite the intentions of the sender at the start of the journey. In these exceptional cases the Contracting Parties shall nevertheless accept the TIR carnet and the liability of the guaranteeing associations shall remain in force. 
0.5. Article 5 
This Article does not exclude the right to carry out spot checks on the goods but stresses that these checks should be very limited in number. The international TIR carnet procedure, in fact, provides protection greater than that given by national procedures. Firstly the particulars on the TIR carnet relating to the goods must agree with the particulars given on the customs documents which may be required in the country of departure. In addition the countries of transit and destination are given protection by the controls which are carried out at departure and which are certified by the customs authorities at the office of departure (see note to Article 19). 
0.6.2. Article 6 (2) 
Under the provisions of this paragraph, the customs authorities of a country may approve more than one association, each of which may incur liability arising from the operations undertaken under cover of the carnets issued by it or by its corresponding associations. 
0.8.3. Article 8 (3) 
Customs authorities are recommended to limit to a sum equal to $ US 50 000 per TIR carnet the maximum amount which may be claimed from the guaranteeing association. 
0.8.6. Article 8 (6) 1. In the absence in the TIR carnet of particulars detailed enough to enable charges on the goods to be determined, the parties concerned may produce evidence of their precise nature. 
2. If no evidence is furnished, duties and taxes will be charged, not at a flat rate unrelated to the nature of the goods, but at the highest rate applicable to the kind of goods covered by the particulars in the TIR carnet. 
0.10. Article 10 
The certificate of discharge of the TIR carnet shall be regarded as having been obtained in an improper or fraudulent manner when the TIR operation has been carried out by means of load compartments or containers adapted for fraudulent purposes, or when such malpractices as the use of false or inaccurate documents, the substitution of goods, tampering with customs seals, etc., have been discovered, or when the certificate has been obtained by other illicit means. 
0.11. Article 11 
0.11-1. In deciding whether or not to release the goods or vehicle, customs authorities should not, when they have other means in law of protecting the interests for which they are responsible, be influenced by the fact that the guaranteeing association is liable for the payment of duties, taxes and default interest payable by the holder of the carnet. 
0.11-2. If a guaranteeing association is asked, in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 11, to pay the sums referred to in Article 8 (1) and (2) and fails to do so within the time limit of three months prescribed by the Convention, the competent authorities may rely on national regulations in requiring payment of the sums in question because what is involved in such cases is a failure to carry out a contract of guarantee entered into by the guaranteeing association under national law. 
0.15. Article 15 
Certain difficulties may arise in the case of vehicles not subject to registration, such as in some countries, trailers or semi-trailers, when customs documents are not required for temporary admission. In that case, the provisions of Article 15 may be observed, while assuring adequate protection for the customs authorities, by recording particulars of these vehicles (make and numbers) on vouchers 1 and 2 of the TIR carnet used by the countries concerned and on the corresponding counterfoils. 
0.17. Article 17 
0.17-1. The provision that the manifest of the goods covered by the TIR carnet shall show separately the contents of each vehicle of a combination of vehicles, or of each container, is only intended to simplify customs inspection of the contents of each vehicle or container. This provision shall not therefore be interpreted so rigidly that each variation between the actual contents of a vehicle or container and the contents of that vehicle or container as shown on the manifest is considered a breach of the provisions of the Convention. If the carrier can satisfy the relevant authorities that, notwithstanding such a variation, all the goods shown on the manifest agree with the total of goods loaded in the combination of vehicles or in all the containers covered by the TIR carnet, this shall not normally be considered a breach of customs requirements. 
0.17-2. In the case of household removals, the procedure laid down in paragraph 10 (c) of the rules for the use of the TIR carnet can be applied, the list of articles concerned being reasonably condensed. 
0.18. Article 18 
0.18-1. It is essential for the smooth operation of the TIR procedure that the customs authorities of one country should refuse to designate a customs office of exit as a customs office of destination for a transport operation which is going on to a neighbouring country when that country is also a Contracting Party to this Convention, unless there are some special circumstances to justify the request. 
0.18-2. 1. Goods should be so loaded that the consignment to be unloaded at the first unloading point can be taken out of the vehicle or the container without it being necessary to unload the other consignment or consignments of goods due to be unloaded at the other unloading points. 
2. Where a transport operation involves unloading at more than one office it is necessary that, after a partial unloading, a record of it should be made in box 12 on all the remaining manifests of the TIR carnet, and at the same time another record should be made on the remaining vouchers and the corresponding counterfoils to the effect that new seals have been affixed. 
0.19. Article 19 
The requirement that the customs office of departure should check the accuracy of the goods manifest implies the need to verify at least that the particulars in the goods manifest tally with those in the export documents and in the transport or other commercial documents relating to the goods ; the customs office of departure may also have to examine the goods. The customs office of departure must also, before affixing seals, check the condition of the road vehicle or container and, in the case of sheeted vehicles or containers, the condition of the sheets and sheet fastenings, as this equipment is not included in the certificate of approval. 
0.20. Article 20 
When fixing time limits for the transport of goods within their territory, customs authorities must likewise take into account inter alia any special regulations to which carriers are subject, particularly regulations concerning working hours and mandatory rest periods for drivers of road vehicles. It is recommended that these authorities should exercise their right to prescribe a route only when they consider it essential. 
0.21. Article 21 
0.21-1. The provisions of this Article do not restrict the right of customs authorities to examine all parts of a vehicle other than the sealed load compartment. 
0.21-2. The customs office of entry may turn back the carrier to the customs office of exit of the adjacent country if it finds that no clearance has been given by that office or that clearance has not been given in due form. In such cases the customs office of entry inserts a note in the TIR carnet for the customs office of exit concerned. 
0.21-3. If in the course of an examination, customs authorities draw samples of goods, a note recording full particulars of the goods taken must be made by those authorities on the goods manifest of the TIR carnet. 
0.28. Article 28 
1. Article 28 provides that discharge of the TIR carnet at the office of destination shall take place without delay, on condition that the goods are placed under another customs procedure or cleared for home use. 
2. The use of the TIR carnet must be restricted to the function which it was intended to cover, namely the transit operation. The TIR carnet must not, for example, be used to cover the storage of goods under customs control at destination. Where no irregularity has taken place, the office of destination must discharge the TIR carnet as soon as the goods covered by the carnet have come under another customs procedure or have been cleared for home use. In practice discharge must be given as soon as the goods have been directly re-exported (as, for example, when they are shipped on arrival at a port), or as soon as a declaration for customs purposes has been made at the place of destination, or as soon as the goods have been received into a place approved for storage while awaiting a declaration for customs purposes (for example, a transit shed), in accordance with the regulations in force in the country of destination. 
0.29. Article 29 
No certificate of approval is required for road vehicles or containers transporting heavy or bulky goods. It is, nevertheless, the responsibility of the customs office of departure to make sure that the other conditions laid down in this Article for this type of transport operation are met. Customs offices of other Contracting Parties shall accept the decision of the customs office of departure unless in their opinion it is clearly in conflict with the provisions of Article 29. 
0.38.1. Article 38 (1) 
A business enterprise should not be excluded from the TIR system because of offences committed by one of its drivers without the knowledge of the management. 
0.38.2. Article 38 (2) 
Where a Contracting Party has been notified that a person established or resident in its territory has committed an offence on the territory of a foreign country, it need not cease to allow the issue of TIR carnets to that person. 
0.39. Article 39 
The expression %quot%mistakes committed through negligence%quot% is to be taken to mean acts which, although not committed deliberately and in full knowledge of the facts, are due to a failure to take reasonable and necessary steps to ensure the accuracy of the facts in any particular case. 
0.45. Article 45 
Contracting Parties are recommended to make the largest possible number of customs offices, both inland and at the frontier, available for dealing with TIR operations. 
2. ANNEX 2 
2.2. Article 2 
2.2.1.(a) Subparagraph 1 (a) - Assembly of constituent parts (a) Where joining devices (rivets, screws, bolts and nuts, etc.) are used, a sufficient number of such devices shall be inserted from outside, traverse the assembled constituent parts, protrude inside and there be firmly secured (e.g. riveted, welded, bushed or bolted and swaged or welded on the nut). However, conventional rivets (i.e. rivets whose placing requires handling from both sides of the assembly of constituent parts) may be inserted from the inside. Notwithstanding the above, load compartment floors may be secured by means of self-tapping screws, or self-drilling rivets or rivets inserted by means of an explosive charge, when placed from inside and passing at right-angles through the floor and the metallic cross-pieces underneath, on condition, except in the case of self-tapping screws, that some of their ends be flush with the level of the outside part of the cross-piece or be welded on to it. 
(b) The competent authority shall determine what joining devices, and how many of them, must fulfil the requirements of subparagraph (a) of this note ; they shall do so by making sure that the constituent parts so assembled cannot be displaced and replaced without leaving obvious traces. The choice and placing of other joining devices are not subject to any restriction. 
(c) Joining devices which can be removed and replaced from one side without leaving obvious traces (i.e. without requiring handling from both sides of the constituent parts to be assembled) shall not be allowed under subparagraph (a) of this note. Examples of such devices are expansion rivets, blind rivets and the like. 
(d) The assembly methods described above shall apply to special vehicles, for example to insulated vehicles, refrigerated vehicles and tank-vehicles in so far as they are not incompatible with the technical requirements which such vehicles must fulfil having regard to their use. Where, due to technical reasons, it is not practicable to secure parts in the manner described in subparagraph (a) of this note, the constituent parts may be joined by means of the devices mentioned in subparagraph (c) of this note provided that the devices used on the inner face of the wall are not accessible from the outside. 
2.2.1.(b) Subparagraph 1 (b) - Doors and other closing systems (a) The device on which customs seals can be fixed must: (i) be secured by welding, or by not less than two joining devices conforming to subparagraph (a) of Explanatory Note 2.2.1 (a), or 
(ii) be so designed that when the load compartment has been closed and sealed the device cannot be removed without leaving obvious traces. 
It must also: (iii) incorporate holes of not less than 11 mm in diameter or slots of at least 11 mm in length by 3 mm in width, and 
(iv) afford equal security whatever type of seal is used. 
(b) Butt hinges, strap hinges, hinge-pins and other devices for hanging doors and the like must be secured in conformity with the requirements of subparagraphs (a) (i) and (ii) of this note. Moreover, the various components of such devices (e.g. hingeplates, pins or swivels) must be so fitted that they cannot be removed or dismantled when the load compartment is closed and sealed without leaving obvious traces. However, where such a device is not accessible from outside it will suffice if, when the door or the like has been closed and sealed, it cannot be detached from the hinge or similar device without leaving obvious traces. Where a door or closure-device has more than two hinges, only those two hinges nearest to the extremities of the door need to be fixed in conformity with the requirements of subparagraph (a) (i) and (ii) above. 
(c) Exceptionally, in the case of vehicles having insulated load compartments, the customs sealing device, the hinges and any fittings, the removal of which would give access to the interior of the load compartment or to spaces in which goods could be concealed, may be fixed to the doors of such load compartments by means of set bolts or set screws which are inserted from the outside but which do not otherwise meet the requirements of Explanatory Note 2.2.1 (a), subparagraph (a) above, on condition that: (i) the tails of the set bolts or set screws are fixed into a tapping plate or similar device fitted behind the outer layer or layers of the door structure, and 
(ii) the heads of the appropriate number of set bolts or set screws are so welded to the customs sealing device, hinges, etc., that they are completely deformed and that the set bolts or set screws cannot be removed without leaving visible signs of tampering (1). 
The term %quot%insulated load compartment%quot% is to be taken to include refrigerated and isothermic load compartments. 
(d) Vehicles comprising a large number of such closures as valves, stopcocks, manhole covers, flanges and the like must be designed so as to keep the number of customs seals to a minimum. To this end, neighbouring closures must be interconnected by a common device requiring only one customs seal, or must be provided with a cover meeting the same purpose. 
(e) Vehicles with opening roofs must be constructed in such a manner as to permit sealing with a minimum number of customs seals. 
2.2.1.(c)-1. Subparagraph 1 (c) - Ventilation apertures (a) Their greatest dimension must, in principle, not exceed 400 mm. 
(b) Apertures permitting direct access to the load compartment, must be obstructed by means of wire gauze or perforated metal screens (maximum dimension of holes : 3 mm in both cases) and protected by welded metal lattice work (maximum dimension of holes : 10 mm). 
(c) Apertures not permitting direct access to the load compartment (e.g. because of elbow or baffle-plate systems) must be provided with the same devices, in which, however, the dimensions of the holes may be as much as 10 and 20 mm respectively. 
(d) Where openings are made in sheets, the devices referred to in subparagraph (b) of this note must in principle be prescribed. However, blocking devices in the form of a perforated metal screen fitted outside, and wire or other gauze fitted inside, will be allowed. 
(e) Identical non-metal devices may be allowed provided that the holes are of the requisite dimensions and the material used is strong enough to prevent the holes from being substantially enlarged without visible damage. In addition, it must be impossible to replace the ventilation device by working from one side of the sheet only. 
2.2.1.(c)- 2. Subparagraph 1 (c) - Drainage apertures (a) Their greatest dimension must, in principle, not exceed 35 mm. 
(b) Apertures permitting direct access to the load compartment must be provided with the devices described in subparagraph (b) of Explanatory Note 2.2.1 (c) - 1 for ventilation apertures. 
(c) When drainage apertures do not permit direct access to the load compartment, the devices referred to in subparagraph (b) of this note will not be prescribed, on condition that the apertures are provided with a reliable baffle system readily accessible from inside the load compartment. 
2.3. Article 3 
2.3.3. Paragraph 3 - Sheets made up of pieces (a) The several pieces constituting one sheet may be made of different materials conforming to the provisions of Article 3 (2) of Annex 2. (1) See Sketch No 1 appended to this Annex. 
(b) Any arrangement of the pieces which adequately guarantees security will be allowed in making up the sheet, on condition that the pieces are assembled in conformity with the requirements of Article 3 of Annex 2. 
2.3.6.(a) Subparagraph 6 (a) - Vehicles with sliding rings 
Metal securing rings sliding on metal bars fixed to the vehicles are acceptable for the purpose of this paragraph (see Sketch No 2 appended to this Annex) provided that: (a) the bars are affixed to the vehicles at maximum spacings of 60 cm and in such a manner that they cannot be removed and replaced without leaving obvious traces; 
(b) the rings are made with a double hoop or equipped with a central bar and made in one piece without the use of welding ; and 
(c) the sheet is fixed to the vehicle in strict compliance with the conditions set forth in Article 1 (a) of Annex 2 to this Convention. 
2.3.6.(b) Subparagraph 6 (b) - Permanently-secured sheets 
Where one or more edges of the sheet are permanently attached to the body of the vehicle, the sheet shall be held in place by one or more strips of metal or other suitable material secured to the body of the vehicle by joining devices meeting the requirements of subparagraph (a) of Explanatory Note 2.2.1 (a) of this Annex. 
2.3.9. Paragraph 9 - Textile-cored steel fastening ropes 
For purposes of this paragraph, ropes comprising a textile core surrounded by six strands consisting solely of steel wire and completely covering the core will be allowed on condition that the ropes (without taking into account the transparent plastic sheath, if any) are not less than 3 mm in diameter. 
2.3.11.(a) Subparagraph 11 (a) - Sheet-tensioning flaps 
The sheets of many vehicles are provided on the outside with a horizontal flap pierced by eyelets running along the length of the side of the vehicle. Such flaps, known as tensioning flaps, are used to tauten the sheet by means of tensioning cords or similar devices. Such flaps have been used to conceal horizontal slits made in the sheets giving improper access to the goods carried in the vehicle. It is therefore recommended that the use of flaps of this type should not be allowed. The following devices may be used instead: (a) tensioning flaps of similar design fixed on the inside of the sheet ; or 
(b) small individual flaps each pierced by one eyelet secured to the outside surface of the sheet and spaced at such distances as will permit an adequate tensioning of the sheet. 
Alternatively, it may be possible in certain cases to avoid the use of tensioning flaps on sheets. 
2.3.11.(c) Subparagraph 11 (c) - Sheet thongs 
2.3.11.(c)-1. The following materials are regarded as suitable for making thongs: (a) leather; 
(b) non-tensile textile materials including plastic-covered or rubberized cloth, provided that such materials cannot after severance be welded or reconstituted without leaving obvious traces. Furthermore, the plastic material used to cover thongs shall be transparent and smooth-surfaced. 
2.3.11.(c)-2. The device shown in Sketch No 3 appended to this Annex meets the requirements of the last part of Article 3 (11) of Annex 2. It also meets the requirements of Article 3 (6) of Annex 2. 
3. ANNEX 3 
3.0.17. Approval procedure 1. Annex 3 provides that the competent authorities of a Contracting Party may issue a certificate of approval in respect of a vehicle constructed within its territory and that no additional approval procedures shall be applied in respect of such a vehicle in the country where it is registered or, as the case may be, where the owner is resident. 
2. These provisions are not intended to restrict the right of the competent authorities of the Contracting Party where the vehicle is registered or where the owner is resident to require the production of such a certificate of approval either at importation or subsequently for purposes connected with the registration or control of the vehicle or with similar legal requirements. 
3.0.20. Procedure for endorsement of the certificate of approval 
When an endorsement concerning defects is to be cancelled after the vehicle has been restored to a satisfactory state, it is sufficient to state, under item 11 provided for the purpose, %quot%defects rectified%quot% followed by the name, signature and stamp of the competent authority concerned.

ANNEX 7 ANNEX REGARDING APPROVAL OF CONTAINERS 
PART I REGULATIONS OF TECHNICAL CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO CONTAINERS WHICH MAY BE ACCEPTED FOR INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT UNDER CUSTOMS SEAL 
Article 1 
Basic principles 
Approval for the international transport of goods under customs seal may be granted only to containers constructed and equipped in such a manner that: (a) no goods can be removed from, or introduced into, the sealed part of the container without leaving visible traces of tampering or without breaking the customs seal; 
(b) customs seals can be simply and effectively affixed to them; 
(c) they contain no concealed spaces where goods may be hidden; 
(d) all spaces capable of holding goods are readily accessible for customs inspection. 
Article 2 
Structure of containers 
1. To meet the requirements of Article 1 of these Regulations: (a) the constituent parts of the container (sides, floor, doors, roof, uprights, frames, cross-pieces, etc.) shall be assembled either by means of devices which cannot be removed and replaced from the outside without leaving visible traces or by such methods as will produce a structure which cannot be modified without leaving visible traces. When the sides, floor, doors and roof are made up of various components, these shall meet the same requirements and be of sufficient strength; 
(b) doors and all other closing systems (including stopcocks, manhole-covers, flanges, etc.) shall be fitted with a device on which customs seals can be fixed. This device must be such that it cannot be removed and replaced from outside the container without leaving visible traces, or the door or fastening be opened without breaking the customs seals. The latter shall be adequately protected. Opening roofs shall be permitted; 
(c) apertures for ventilation and drainage shall be provided with a device preventing access to the interior of the container. This device must be such that it cannot be removed and replaced from outside the container without leaving visible traces. 
2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1 (c) of these Regulations, constituent parts of the container which, for practical reasons, have to include empty spaces (for example, between the partitions of a double wall) shall be permitted. In order that the said spaces cannot be used to conceal goods: (i) it shall not be possible to remove and replace the lining inside the container without leaving visible traces, or 
(ii) the number of the said spaces shall be kept to a minimum and these spaces shall be readily accessible for customs inspection. 
Article 3 
Containers capable of being folded or dismantled 
Containers capable of being folded or dismantled shall be subject to the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of these Regulations ; in addition, they shall be fitted with a bolting system which locks the various parts together once the container has been erected. This bolting system must be capable of being sealed by the customs authorities if it is on the outside of the container when the latter has been erected. 
Article 4 
Sheeted containers 
1. Where applicable, the provisions of Articles 1, 2 and 3 of these Regulations shall apply to sheeted containers. In addition, these containers shall conform to the provisions of this Article. 
2. The sheet shall be either of strong canvas or of plastic-covered or rubberized cloth, which shall be of sufficient strength and unstretchable. It shall be in good condition and made up in such a way that once the closing device has been secured, it is impossible to gain access to the load without leaving visible traces. 
3. If the sheet is made up of several pieces, their edges shall be folded into one another and sewn together with two seams at least 15 mm apart. These seams shall be made as shown in Sketch No 1 appended to these Regulations ; however, where in the case of certain parts of the sheet (such as flaps at the rear and reinforced corners) it is not possible to assemble the pieces in that way, it shall be sufficient to fold the edge of the top section and make the seams as shown in Sketch No 2 appended to these Regulations. One of the seams shall be visible only from the inside and the colour of the thread used for that seam shall be clearly different from the colour of the sheet itself and from the colour of the thread used for the other seam. All seams shall be machine-sewn. 
4. If the sheet is of plastic-covered cloth, and is made up of several pieces, the pieces may alternatively be welded together in the manner shown in Sketch No 3 appended to these Regulations. The edges of the pieces shall overlap by at least 15 mm. The pieces shall be fused together over the whole width of the overlap. The edge of the outer sheet shall be covered with a band of plastic material at least 7 mm wide, affixed by the same welding process. The plastic band and a width of at least 3 mm on each side shall have a well-marked uniform relief stamped on it. The pieces shall be welded in such a way that they cannot be separated and rejoined without leaving visible traces. 
5. Repairs shall be made in accordance with the method described in Sketch No 4 appended to these Regulations ; the edges shall be folded into one another and sewn together with two visible seams at least 15 mm apart ; the colour of the thread visible from the inside shall be different from that of the thread visible from the outside and from that of the sheet itself ; all seams shall be machine-sewn. When a sheet which has been damaged near the edges is repaired by replacing the damaged part by a patch, the seam can also be made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article and Sketch No 1 appended to these Regulations. Sheets of plastic-covered cloth may alternatively be repaired in accordance with the method described in paragraph 4 of this Article, but in that case the weld must be made on both sides of the sheet, the patch being fitted on the inside of the sheet. 
6. 
(a) The sheet shall be fixed to the container in strict compliance with the conditions set forth in Article 1 (a) and (b) of these Regulations. The following types of fastening shall be provided: (i) metal rings fixed to the container, 
(ii) eyelets in the edge of the sheet, 
(iii) a fastening passing through the rings above the sheet and visible from the outside for its entire length. 
The sheet shall overlap solid parts of the container by at least 250 mm, measured from the centre of the securing rings, unless the system of construction of the container by itself prevents all access to the goods. 
(b) When the edge of a sheet is to be permanently secured to a container, the joint shall be continuous and effected by means of solid devices. 
7. The interval between rings and between eyelets shall not exceed 200 mm. The eyelets shall be reinforced. 
8. The following fastenings shall be used: (a) steel wire rope of at least 3 mm diameter ; or 
(b) a rope of hemp or sisal of at least 8 mm diameter encased in a transparent unstretchable plastic sheath. 
Wire ropes may have a transparent unstretchable plastic sheath. 
9. Each rope shall be in one piece and have a hard metal end-piece at each end. The fastener of each metal end-piece shall include a hollow rivet passing through the rope so as to allow the introduction of the thread or the strap of the customs seal. The rope shall remain visible on either side of the hollow rivet so that it is possible to ensure that the rope is in one piece (see Sketch No 5 appended to these Regulations). 
10. At the openings in the sheet, used for loading and unloading, the two edges of the sheet shall have an adequate overlap. They shall also be fastened by: (a) a flap sewn or welded in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article; 
(b) rings and eyelets meeting the conditions of paragraph 7 of this Article ; and 
(c) a thong made of appropriate material, in one piece and unstretchable, at least 20 mm wide and 3 mm thick, passing through the rings and holding together the two edges of the sheet and the flap ; the thong shall be secured inside the sheet and fitted with an eyelet to take the rope mentioned in paragraph 8 of this Article. 
A flap shall not be required if a special device, such as a baffle plate, is fitted, which prevents access to the goods without leaving visible traces. 
11. The identification marks, which must appear on the container, and the approval plate provided for in Part II of this Annex, shall in no circumstances be covered by the sheet. 
Article 5 
Transitional provisions 
Until 1 January 1977, end-pieces shall be allowed which conform to Sketch No 5 appended to these Regulations, even if they include hollow rivets of a type previously accepted with holes of dimensions less than those given in the sketch.

PART II PROCEDURES FOR THE APPROVAL OF CONTAINERS COMPLYING WITH THE TECHNICAL CONDITIONS PRESCRIBED IN PART I 
General 
1. Containers may be approved for the transport of goods under customs seal either: (a) at the manufacturing stage, by design type (procedure for approval at the manufacturing stage) ; or 
(b) at a stage subsequent to manufacture, either individually or in respect of a specified number of containers of the same type (procedure for approval at a stage subsequent to manufacture). 
Provisions common to both approval procedures 
2. The competent authority responsible for granting approval shall issue to the applicant, after approval, a certificate of approval valid, as the case may be, either for an unlimited series of containers of the approved type or for a specified number of containers. 
3. The beneficiary of approval shall affix an approval plate to the approved container or containers before their use for the transport of goods under customs seal. 
4. The approval plate shall be affixed permanently and in a clearly visible place adjacent to any other approval plate issued for official purposes. 
5. The approval plate, conforming to Model I reproduced in Appendix 1 hereto, shall take the form of a metal plate measuring not less than 20 Ă&#x2014; 10 cm. The following particulars shall be stamped into or embossed on the plate or indicated on its surface in any other permanent and legible way, in at least the English or the French language: (a) the words %quot%Approved for transport under customs seal%quot%; 
(b) an indication of the country, in which approval was granted either by name or by means of the distinguishing sign used to indicate the country of registration of motor vehicles in international road traffic, and the number (figures, letters, etc.) of the certificate of approval and the year (e.g. %quot%NL/26/73%quot% means %quot%Netherlands, certificate of approval No 26, issued in 1973%quot%); 
(c) the serial number assigned to the container by the manufacturer (manufacturer's number): 
(d) if the container has been approved by type, the identification numbers or letters of the type of container. 
6. If a container no longer complies with the technical conditions prescribed for its approval, it shall, before it can be used for the transport of goods under customs seal, be restored to the condition which had justified its approval, so as to comply again with the said technical conditions. 
7. If the essential characteristics of a container are changed, the container shall cease to be covered by the approval and shall be reapproved by the competent authority before it can be used for the transport of goods under customs seal. 
Special provisions for approval by design type at the manufacturing stage 
8. Where the containers are manufactured by type series, the manufacturer may apply to the competent authority of the country of manufacture for approval by design type. 
9. The manufacturer shall state in his application the identification numbers or letters which he assigns to the type of container to which his application for approval relates. 
10. The application shall be accompanied by drawings and a detailed design specification of the container type to be approved. 
11. The manufacturer shall give an undertaking in writing that he will: (a) produce to the competent authority such containers of the type concerned as that authority may wish to examine; 
(b) permit the competent authority to examine further units at any time during the production of the type series concerned; 
(c) advise the competent authority of any change, of whatever magnitude, in the design or specification before proceeding with such change; 
(d) mark the containers in a visible place with, in addition to the markings required on the approval plate, the identification numbers or letters of the design type and the serial number of the container in the type series (manufacturer's number); 
(e) keep a record of containers manufactured to the approved design type. 
12. The competent authority shall state what changes, if any, must be made to the proposed design type so that approval may be granted. 
13. No type-approval by design type shall be granted unless the competent authority has satisfied itself by examination of one or more containers manufactured to the design type concerned that containers of that type comply with the technical conditions prescribed in Part 1. 
14. When a container type is approved there shall be issued to the applicant a single certificate of approval conforming to Model II reproduced in Appendix 2 hereto and valid for all containers manufactured in conformity with the specifications of the type so approved. Such certificate shall entitle the manufacturer to affix to every container of the type series an approval plate in the form prescribed in paragraph 5. 
Special provisions for approval at a stage subsequent to manufacture 
15. If approval has not been applied for at the manufacturing stage, the owner, the operator, or the representative of either, may apply for approval to the competent authority to which he is able to produce the container or containers and for which he seeks approval. 
16. An application for approval submitted under paragraph 15 shall state the serial number (manufacturer's number) placed on each container by the manufacturer. 
17. When the competent authority has ascertained that the container or containers comply with the technical conditions prescribed in Part I, by examination of as many containers as it considers necessary, it shall issue a certificate of approval conforming to Model III reproduced in Appendix 3 hereto and valid solely for the number of containers approved. Such certificate, which shall bear the manufacturer's serial number or numbers assigned to the container or containers to which it relates, shall entitle the applicant to affix to each container so approved the approval plate prescribed in paragraph 5.
