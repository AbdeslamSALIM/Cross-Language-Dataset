Maximum aid intensity: 
The above intensities are increased by 10 percentage points if the training for which aid is granted is given to disadvantaged workers, as referred to in Article 2(g) of Regulation (EC) No 68/2001 and further defined in D.D. 800/RIC/2001. 
Date of implementation: 10 July 2002 
Duration of scheme: Until 31 December 2006 
Objective of aid: The aid scheme covers general and specific training. General training within the meaning of Article 2(e) of Regulation (EC) No 68/2001 involves training which is not applicable only or principally to the employee's present or future position in the assisted firm but which provides qualifications that are largely transferable to other firms or fields of work and thereby substantially improve the employability of the employee. For the purposes of implementing this aid scheme, "general" training means: inter-enterprise training, i.e. training organised jointly by different independent enterprises or in which employees of different enterprises may take part. 
Economic sector(s) concerned Comments 
Firstly, the aid scheme applies to all sectors covered by Regulation (EC) No 68/2001. Secondly, it does not apply to aid for training or retraining workers employed by firms in difficulty within the meaning of the Community guidelines on state aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty (OJ C 288, 9.10.1999), as part of rescue or restructuring operations assisted through public funds (rescue and/or restructuring aid). Such aid will be assessed in the light of those guidelines. Thirdly, the aid scheme does not apply if the amount of aid granted to one enterprise for a single training project exceeds EUR 1 million, in which case the individual aid grant must be notified to the Commission for its approval.
