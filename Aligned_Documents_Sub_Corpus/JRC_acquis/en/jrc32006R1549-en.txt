PART ONE 
PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS 
SECTION I 
GENERAL RULES 
A. General rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature 
Classification of goods in the Combined Nomenclature shall be governed by the following principles: 
1. The titles of sections, chapters and sub-chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes and, provided such headings or notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions. 
2. (a) Any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete or unfinished, provided that, as presented, the incomplete or unfinished article has the essential character of the complete or finished article. It shall also be taken to include a reference to that article complete or finished (or falling to be classified as complete or finished by virtue of this rule), presented unassembled or disassembled. 
(b) Any reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or combinations of that material or substance with other materials or substances. Any reference to goods of a given material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or partly of such material or substance. The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance shall be according to the principles of rule 3. 
3. When, by application of rule 2(b) or for any other reason, goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows: 
(a) the heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description. However, when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives a more complete or precise description of the goods; 
(b) mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, in so far as this criterion is applicable; 
(c) when goods cannot be classified by reference to 3(a) or (b), they shall be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration. 
4. Goods which cannot be classified in accordance with the above rules shall be classified under the heading appropriate to the goods to which they are most akin. 
5. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the following rules shall apply in respect of the goods referred to therein: 
(a) camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, drawing-instrument cases, necklace cases and similar containers, specially shaped or fitted to contain a specific article or set of articles, suitable for long-term use and presented with the articles for which they are intended, shall be classified with such articles when of a kind normally sold therewith. This rule does not, however, apply to containers which give the whole its essential character; 
(b) subject to the provisions of rule 5(a), packing materials and packing containers [1] presented with the goods therein shall be classified with the goods if they are of a kind normally used for packing such goods. However, this provision is not binding when such packing materials or packing containers are clearly suitable for repetitive use. 
6. For legal purposes, the classification of goods in the subheadings of a heading shall be determined according to the terms of those subheadings and any related subheading notes and, mutatis mutandis, to the above rules, on the understanding that only subheadings at the same level are comparable. For the purposes of this rule, the relative section and chapter notes also apply, unless the context requires otherwise. 
B. General rules concerning duties 
1. The customs duties applicable to imported goods originating in countries which are Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or with which the European Community has concluded agreements containing the most-favoured-nation tariff clause shall be the conventional duties shown in column 3 of the schedule of duties. Unless the context requires otherwise, these conventional duties are applicable to goods, other than those referred to above, imported from any third country. 
The conventional rates of duty reproduced in column 3 are applicable from 1 January 2007. 
When autonomous rates of duty are lower than the conventional rates of duty, the autonomous duties, shown by means of a footnote, are applicable. 
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply where special autonomous customs duties are provided for in respect of goods originating in certain countries or where preferential customs duties are applicable in pursuance of agreements. 
3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not preclude the Member States from applying customs duties other than those of the Common Customs Tariff where the application of such other duties is justified by Community law. 
4. The duties expressed as percentage rates are ad valorem duties. 
5. The symbol "EA" indicates that the goods concerned are chargeable with an "agricultural component" fixed in accordance with Annex 1. 
6. The symbol "AD S/Z" or "AD F/M" in Chapters 17 to 19 indicates that the maximum rate of duty consists of an ad valorem duty plus an additional duty for certain forms of sugar or for flour. This additional duty is fixed in accordance with the provisions of Annex 1. 
7. In Chapter 22, the symbol "€/% vol/hl" means that a specific duty, expressed in euro, is to be calculated for each percentage volume of alcohol per hectolitre. Thus, a beverage having an alcohol content by volume of 40 % is to be charged as follows: 
- "€ 1/% vol/hl" = € 1 × 40, giving a duty of € 40 per hectolitre, or 
- "€ 1/% vol/hl + € 5/hl" = € 1 × 40 plus € 5, giving a duty of € 45 per hectolitre. 
Where, in addition, a minimum (MIN) value is shown, for example "€ 1,6/% vol/hl MIN € 9/hl", it means that the duty, calculated on the basis of the abovementioned rule, is to be compared with the minimum duty, for example "€ 9/hl", and the higher of the two is to be applied. 
C. General rules applicable both to nomenclature and to duties 
1. Unless provided otherwise, the provisions relating to customs value shall be applied to determine, in addition to the value for the assessment of ad valorem customs duties, the values by reference to which the scope of certain headings or subheadings is defined. 
2. The dutiable weight, in the case of goods chargeable by weight, and the weights by reference to which the scope of certain headings or subheadings is defined, shall be taken to be: 
(a) in the case of a reference to "gross weight", the aggregate weight of the goods and of all the packing materials and packing containers; 
(b) in the case of a reference to "net weight" or simply to "weight" without qualification, the weight of the goods themselves without packing materials and packing containers of any kind. 
3. The equivalent in national currencies of the euro, for Member States other than participating Member States as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 [2] (hereafter called "non-participating Member States"), shall be fixed in accordance with Article 18 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 [3]. 
4. Goods eligible for favourable tariff treatment by reason of their end-use: 
Where the import duty applicable under the end-use arrangements to goods for a specific end-use is not lower than that which would otherwise be applicable to the goods, the said goods shall be classified in the code referring to the end-use and Articles 291 to 300 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 (OJ L 253, 11.10.1993) shall not apply. 
SECTION II 
SPECIAL PROVISIONS 
A. Goods for certain categories of ships, boats and other vessels and for drilling or production platforms 
1. Customs duties shall be suspended in respect of goods intended for incorporation in the ships, boats or other vessels listed in the following schedule, for the purposes of their construction, repair, maintenance or conversion, and in respect of goods intended for fitting to or equipping such ships, boats or other vessels.

C. Pharmaceutical products 
1. Relief from customs duty is provided for pharmaceutical products of the following categories: 
(1) pharmaceutical substances which are covered by the CAS RN (chemical abstracts service registry numbers) and the international non-proprietary names (INNs) listed in Annex 3; 
(2) salts, esters and hydrates of INNs which are described by combining INNs of Annex 3 with prefixes or suffixes of Annex 4, provided such products are classifiable in the same 6-digit HS-subheadings as the relevant INN; 
(3) salts, esters and hydrates of INNs which are listed in Annex 5 and which are not classifiable in the same 6-digit HS-subheadings as the corresponding INNs; 
(4) pharmaceutical intermediates, i.e. compounds used in the manufacture of finished pharmaceutical products which are covered by the CAS RN and the chemical names, listed in Annex 6. 
2. Special cases: 
(1) INNs cover only those substances described in the lists of recommended and proposed INNs published by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Where the number of substances covered by an INN is less than that covered by the CAS RN, only those substances covered by the INN will be subject to duty-free treatment; 
(2) where a product of Annex 3 or Annex 6 is identified by a CAS RN corresponding to a specific isomer, only that isomer may qualify for duty-free treatment; 
(3) double derivatives (salts, esters and hydrates) of INNs identified by a combination of an INN of Annex 3 with a prefix or suffix of Annex 4 qualify for duty-free treatment, provided they are classifiable in the same 6-digit HS-subheading as the relevant INN: 
example: alanine methyl ester, hydrochloride; 
(4) where an INN of Annex 3 is a salt (or an ester), no other salt (or ester) of the acid corresponding to the INN may qualify for duty-free treatment: 
example: oxprenoate potassium (INN): duty-free 
oxprenoate sodium: not duty-free. 
D. Standard rate of duty 
1. Customs duty shall be charged at the flat rate of 3,5 % ad valorem on goods: 
- contained in consignments sent by one private individual to another, or 
- contained in travellers' personal luggage, 
provided that such importations are not of a commercial nature. 
This flat-rate 3,5 % customs duty shall apply, provided that the value of the goods subject to import duty does not exceed € 350 per consignment or per traveller. 
Such flat-rate assessment shall not apply to goods of Chapter 24 which are contained in a consignment or in travellers' personal luggage in amounts exceeding those laid down in Article 31 or in Article 46 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 [4]. 
2. Importations shall be treated as not being of a commercial nature if: 
(a) in the case of goods contained in consignments sent by one private individual to another, such consignments: 
- are of an occasional nature, 
- contain goods exclusively for the personal use of the consignee or his family, which do not by their nature or quantity reflect any commercial interest, 
- are sent to the consignee by the consignor free of payment of any kind; 
(b) in the case of goods contained in travellers' personal luggage, they: 
- are of an occasional nature, and 
- consist exclusively of goods for the personal use of the travellers or their families, or of goods intended as presents; the nature and quantity of such goods must not be such as might indicate that they are being imported for commercial reasons. 
3. The flat rate of customs duty shall not apply to goods imported under the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 if the person entitled has, before the said flat rate is applied to them, requested that they be subject to the customs duties appropriate to them. All the goods making up the consignment shall then be subject to the import duties which are appropriate to them, without prejudice to the duty-free admission provided for pursuant to Articles 29 to 31 and 45 to 49 of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83. 
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, import duties shall mean both customs duties and charges having equivalent effect and other import charges provided for under the common agricultural policy or under specific arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products. 
4. Non-participating Member States may round off the amount in national currencies resulting from the conversion of the sum of € 350. 
5. Non-participating Member States may maintain unchanged the equivalent in national currency of the sum of € 350 if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in Article 18(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 the conversion of this amount, before the rounding off provided for in paragraph 4, results in a change of less than 5 % in the equivalent in national currency, or in a reduction thereof. 
E. Containers and packing materials 
The following provisions are applicable to the containers and packing materials referred to in general interpretative rule 5(a) and (b) and put into free circulation at the same time as the goods which they contain or with which they are presented. 
1. When the containers and packing materials are classified with the goods in accordance with the provisions of general interpretative rule 5, they shall be: 
(a) chargeable at the same rate of customs duty as the goods: 
- where such goods are subject to an ad valorem customs duty, or 
- where they are to be included in the dutiable weight of the goods; 
(b) admitted free of customs duties: 
- where the goods are free of customs duty, or 
- where the goods are dutiable otherwise than by reference to weight or value, or 
- where the weight of the containers and packing materials is not to be included in the dutiable weight of the goods. 
2. Where containers and packing materials covered by the provisions of paragraph 1(a) and (b) contain or are presented with goods of several different tariff descriptions, the weight and value of the containers and packing materials shall, for the purpose of determining their dutiable weight or value, be apportioned among all the goods contained, in proportion to the weight or value of those goods. 
F. Favourable tariff treatment by reason of the nature of the goods 
1. Under certain conditions, favourable tariff treatment by reason of the nature of the goods is provided for: 
- goods unfit for consumption, 
- seeds, 
- bolting cloth, not made up, 
- certain types of fresh table grapes, tobacco and nitrate. 
These goods are covered by subheadings [5] with a footnote reference in the following terms: "Entry under this subheading is subject to the conditions laid down in section II, paragraph F, of the preliminary provisions." 
2. Goods unfit for consumption for which favourable tariff treatment is granted by reason of their nature are listed in Annex 8 by reference to the heading under which they are classified together with the description and the quantities of the denaturants used. Such goods are presumed to be unfit for consumption when the goods to be denatured and the denaturants are homogeneously mixed and their separation is economically not viable. 
3. The goods listed below shall be classified in the appropriate headings for seed or for sowing, provided that the goods comply with the relevant Community provisions: 
- for sweetcorn, spelt, hybrid maize, rice and sorghum (Council Directive 66/402/EEC [6]), 
- for seed potatoes (Council Directive 2002/56/EC of 13 June 2002 [7]), 
- for oil seeds and oleaginous fruits (Council Directive 2002/57/EC of 13 June 2002 [8]). 
When hybrid sweetcorn, spelt, hybrid maize, rice, hybrid sorghum or oil seeds and oleaginous fruits are of a kind to which the agricultural provisions do not apply, favourable tariff treatment by reason of their nature shall be granted, provided that it is established that the goods are actually intended for sowing. 
4. Bolting cloth, not made up, is granted favourable tariff treatment on the condition that the goods are indelibly marked in a way identifying them as being intended for bolting or similar industrial purposes. 
5. Fresh table grapes, tobacco and nitrate are granted favourable tariff treatment on production of a duly endorsed certificate. The particular provisions to be applied and the model of the certificates are set out at Annex 9.

"crop" and "chuck and blade" cuts, for the purposes of subheading 02023050: the dorsal part of the forequarter, including the upper part of the shoulder, obtained from a forequarter with a minimum of four ribs and a maximum of 10 ribs by a cut along a straight line through the point where the first rib joins the first sternal segment to the point of reflection of the diaphragm on the 10th rib; 
2. "brisket" cut, for the purposes of subheading 02023050: the lower part of the forequarter, comprising the brisket navel end and the brisket point end. 
B. Products covered by additional notes 1(A)(a) to (g) to this chapter may be presented with or without the vertebral column. 
C. In determining the number of whole or cut ribs referred to in additional note 1(A), only those attached to the vertebral column shall be taken into consideration. If the vertebral column has been removed, only the whole or cut ribs which otherwise would have been directly attached to the vertebral column shall be taken into consideration. 
2. A. The following expressions shall have the meanings hereunder assigned to them: 
(a) "carcases or half-carcases", for the purposes of subheadings 02031110 and 02032110: slaughtered pigs, in the form of carcases of domestic swine which have been bled and eviscerated and from which the bristles and hooves have been removed. Half-carcases are derived from whole carcases by division through each cervical, dorsal, lumbar and sacral vertebra, through or along the sternum and through the ischio-pubic symphysis. These carcases or half-carcases may be with or without head, with or without the chaps, feet, flare fat, kidneys, tail or diaphragm. Half-carcases may be with or without spinal cord, brain or tongue. Carcases and half-carcases of sows may be with or without udders (mammary glands); 
(b) "hams" (legs), for the purposes of subheadings 02031211, 02032211, 02101111 and 02101131: the posterior (caudal) part of the half-carcase, including bones, with or without the foot, shank, rind or subcutaneous fat. 
The ham (leg) is separated from the rest of the half-carcase, so that it includes, at most, the last lumbar vertebra; 
(c) "fore-ends", for the purposes of subheadings 02031911, 02032911, 02101930 and 02101960: the anterior (cranial) part of the half-carcase without the head, with or without the chaps, including bones, with or without foot, shank, rind or subcutaneous fat. 
The fore-end is separated from the rest of the half-carcase so that it includes, at most, the fifth dorsal vertebra. 
The upper (dorsal) part of the fore-end, whether or not containing the blade-bone and attached muscles (neck-end in fresh or collar in salted condition), is considered a cut of the loin, when it is separated from the lower (ventral) part of the fore-end, at most by a cut just below the vertebral column; 
(d) "shoulders", for the purposes of subheadings 02031219, 02032219, 02101119 and 02101139: the lower part of the fore-end whether or not containing the blade-bone and attached muscles, including bones, with or without foot, shank, rind or subcutaneous fat. 
The blade-bone and attached muscles, presented separately, shall remain classified in this subheading as a part of the shoulder; 
(e) "loins", for the purposes of subheadings 02031913, 02032913, 02101940 and 02101970: the upper part of the half-carcase, extending from the first cervical vertebra to the caudal vertebrae, including bones, with or without the tenderloin, blade-bone, subcutaneous fat or rind. 
The loin is separated from the lower part of the half-carcase by a cut just below the vertebral column; 
(f) "bellies", for the purposes of subheadings 02031915, 02032915, 02101211 and 02101219: the lower part of the half-carcase situated between the ham (leg) and the shoulder, commonly known as "streaky", with or without bones, but with the rind and the subcutaneous fat; 
(g) "bacon sides", for the purposes of subheading 02101910: the pig half-carcase without the head, cheek, chap, feet, tail, flare fat, kidney, tenderloin, blade-bone, sternum, vertebral column, pelvic bone and diaphragm; 
(h) "spencers", for the purposes of subheading 02101910: the bacon side without the ham, whether or not boned; 
(ij) "three-quarter sides", for the purposes of subheading 02101920: the bacon side without the fore-end, whether or not boned; 
(k) "middles", for the purposes of subheading 02101920: the bacon side without the ham and the fore-end, whether or not boned. 
The subheading also includes cuts of middles containing tissue of loin and belly in natural proportion to the entire middles. 
B. The parts of the cuts defined in paragraph 2(A)(f) fall in the same subheadings only if they contain rind and subcutaneous fat. 
If the cuts falling in subheadings 02101111, 02101119, 02101131, 02101139, 02101930 and 02101960 are derived from a bacon side from which the bones indicated under paragraph 2(A)(g) have already been removed, the lines of cutting shall follow those defined under paragraph 2(A)(b), (c) and (d) accordingly; in any case, these cuts or parts thereof shall contain bones. 
C. Subheadings 02064920 and 02109949, shall include, in particular, heads or halves of heads of domestic swine, with or without the brains, cheeks or tongues, and parts thereof. 
The head is separated from the rest of the half-carcase as follows: 
- by a straight cut parallel to the cranium; or 
- by a cut parallel to the cranium up to the level of the eyes and then inclined to the front of the head, thereby causing the chaps to remain attached to the half-carcase. 
The cheeks, snouts and ears as well as the meat attached to the head, particularly to the rear part, are considered parts of heads. However, the cuts of boneless meat of the fore-end, presented alone (jowls, chaps or chaps and jowls together), fall in subheading 02031955, 02032955, 02101950 or 02101981, as the case may be. 
D. For the purposes of subheadings 02090011 and 02090019, "subcutaneous pig fat" shall have the meaning of the fatty tissue which accumulates under the rind of the pig and adheres to it, irrespective of the part of the pig from which it comes; in any case, the weight of the fatty tissue shall exceed the weight of the rind. 
These subheadings also include subcutaneous pig fat from which the rind has been removed. 
E.

Where carcases are imported without the heads, the latter must have been separated from the carcase at the atloido-occipital joint. When imported without the feet, the latter must have been cut off at the carpo-metacarpal or tarso-metatarsal joints; 
(b) "half-carcases", for the purposes of subheadings 020410, 020421, 020430, 020441, 02045011 and 02045051: the product resulting from the symmetrical division of the whole carcase through the centre of each cervical, dorsal, lumbar and sacral vertebra and through the centre of the sternum and of the ischio-pubic symphysis; 
(c) "short-forequarters", for the purposes of subheadings 02042210, 02044210, 02045013 and 02045053: the anterior part of the carcase, with or without the breast, including all the bones and the shoulders, scrag and middle neck, cut at right angles to the backbone, with a minimum of five and a maximum of seven pairs of whole or cut ribs;

Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series of subheadings under consideration are to be compared; 
(b) where there is no subheading named "Other" in the same series: 
(1) polymers are to be classified in the subheading covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series under consideration are to be compared; 
(2) chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading appropriate to the unmodified polymer. 
Polymer blends are to be classified in the same subheading as polymers of the same monomer units in the same proportions. 
2. For the purposes of subheading 392043, the term "plasticisers" includes secondary plasticisers.

10. Articles of this chapter may be made of metal thread. 
Additional notes 
1. For the application of note 3(b) to this chapter, the components of an ensemble must be made up entirely in a single identical fabric, subject to compliance with the other conditions laid down in the said note. 
For this purpose: 
- the fabric used can be unbleached, bleached, dyed, of yarns of different colours or printed, 
- a pullover or waistcoat with ribbing is to be considered as a component of an ensemble, even if there is no ribbing on the component intended to cover the lower part of the body, provided that the ribbing is not sewn on but produced directly by the knitting process. 
Sets of garments are not regarded as ensembles when their components are made up in different fabrics, even if the difference is due only to their respective colours. 
All the components of an ensemble must be presented together for retail sale as a single unit. Individual wrapping or separate labelling of each component of such a single unit does not influence its classification as an ensemble. 
2. For the purposes of heading 6109, the terms "singlets" and "other vests" include garments, even if of a fancy design, worn next to the body, without collar, with or without sleeves, including those with shoulder straps. 
These garments, which are intended to cover the upper part of the body, often possess many characteristics in common with those of T-shirts or with more traditional kinds of singlets and other vests of heading 6109. 
3. Heading 6111 and subheadings 61161020 and 61161080 cover gloves, mittens and mitts, impregnated, coated or covered with plastics or rubber, even if they are: 
- made up from knitted or crocheted textile fabrics impregnated, coated or covered with plastics or rubber of heading 5903 or 5906, or 
- made up from unimpregnated, uncoated or uncovered knitted or crocheted textile fabrics and subsequently impregnated, coated or covered with plastics or rubber. 
Where knitted or crocheted textile fabrics serve only as reinforcement, gloves, mittens or mitts impregnated, coated or covered with cellular plastics or cellular rubber belong in Chapter 39 or 40, even if they are made up from unimpregnated, uncoated or uncovered knitted or crocheted textile fabrics and subsequently impregnated, coated or covered with cellular plastics or cellular rubber (note 2(a)(5) and note 4, last paragraph, to Chapter 59).
