2005/620/EC: Commission Decision of 18 August 2005 amending Annex II to Council Decision 79/542/EEC as regards imports of fresh meat from Argentina and Russia (notified under document number C(2005) 3147) (Text with EEA relevance) 
Commission Decision 
of 18 August 2005 
amending Annex II to Council Decision 79/542/EEC as regards imports of fresh meat from Argentina and Russia 
(notified under document number C(2005) 3147) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2005/620/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption [1], and in particular Article 8(1) and (4) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Part 1 of Annex II to Council Decision 79/542/EEC of 21 December 1979 drawing up a list of third countries or parts of third countries, and laying down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions, for importation into the Community of certain live animals and their fresh meat [2] sets out a list of third countries and parts of third countries from which Member States are authorised to import certain live animals and their fresh meat. 
(2) The territory of AR-4 in Argentina is free from foot-and-mouth disease without vaccination. That is correctly reflected under the specific conditions listed in Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC under which the use of veterinary certificates BOV, OVI, RUW and RUF is authorised for that territory. However, the list of third countries and parts thereof in Part 1 of Annex II to that Decision as shown in the row relevant to the territory of AR-4 is not consistent with that. Therefore RUW and RUF should be inserted in that row for clarity and consistency. 
(3) The date of application relevant to the geographic and timing restrictions concerning the territory of AR-8 has been incorrectly stated and may lead to confusion. For the sake of clarity the date of application in the specific conditions table for the unauthorised period should be corrected to 17 March 2005. 
(4) The Murmansk region of Russia is authorised for importation to the Community meat of farmed non-domestic animals other than suidae and solipeds. Russia has asked the Commission to include the Yamalo-Nenets autonomous area in the list of third countries or parts thereof from which the fresh meat of farmed reindeer may be imported into the Community. 
(5) Following that request a mission was carried out in the Yamalo-Nenets autonomous area by the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) from 22 to 26 November 2004. The conclusion of that mission is that the animal health situation in the area is satisfactory and that the competent veterinary authority provides appropriate guarantees as regards compliance with Community legislation, in particular the items mentioned in Article 8 paragraph 1 of Directive 2002/99/EC. Furthermore, Russia provided an action plan addressing all the recommendations of the mission report in a satisfactory way. 
(6) It is therefore appropriate to list the Yamalo-Nenets autonomous area as being authorised to import into the Community the fresh meat of farmed non-domestic animals other than suidae and solipeds. 
(7) Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC should be amended accordingly. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Decision. 
Article 2 
This Decision shall enter into force on the 30th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
It shall apply immediately. 
Article 3 
This Decision is addressed to the Member States. 
Done at Brussels, 18 August 2005.
