ANNEX I 
" 
PROTOCOL 1 
concerning the arrangements applicable to imports into the Community of agricultural products originating in Israel 
1. The products listed in the Annex, originating in Israel shall be admitted for importation into the Community, according to the conditions contained hereafter and in the Annex. 
2. (a) Customs duties are eliminated or reduced as indicated in column "a". 
(b) For certain products, for which the Common Customs Tariff foresees the application of an ad valorem duty and a specific duty, the rates of reduction, indicated in columns "a" and "c", only apply to the ad valorem duty. However, for the products corresponding to the Codes 01051200, 0207, 040410, 040700, 07099060, 220421 and 2209, the duty reductions also apply to the specific duty. 
(c) For certain products, customs duties are eliminated within the limit of the tariff quotas listed in column "b" for each of them. These tariff quotas shall apply on an annual basis from 1 January to 31 December, unless otherwise specified. 
(d) For the quantities imported in excess of the quotas, the common customs duties are, according to the product concerned, applied in full or reduced, as indicated in column "c". 
3. For certain products, the exemption of customs duties is granted in the framework of reference quantities as indicated in column "d". 
Should the volume of imports of one of these products exceed the reference quantity, the Community, having regard to an annual review of trade flows which it shall carry out, may make the product in question subject to a Community tariff quota, the volume of which shall be equal to the reference quantity. In that case, for quantities imported in excess of the quota, the common customs duty is, according to the product concerned, applied in full or reduced as indicated in column "c". 
4. As indicated in column "e", for some products, for which neither a quota nor a reference quantity is fixed, the Community may fix a reference quantity as provided for in point 3 if, in the light of the annual review of trade flows which it shall carry out, it establishes that the volume of imports of a product or products threatens to cause difficulties on the Community market. If subsequently, the product is subject to a tariff quota under the conditions set out in point 3, for quantities imported in excess of the quota, the customs duty is, according to the product concerned, applied in full or reduced, as indicated in column "c". 
5. For the first year of application, the volumes of the tariff quotas and the reference quantities shall be calculated as a pro rata of the basic volumes, taking into account the part of the period elapsed before the application of this Protocol. 
6. For all the products listed in the Annex, the tariff quota and references quantity volumes are increased from 1 January 2004 to 1 January 2007, in four equal instalments, each corresponding to 3 % of these volumes.

[2] Notwithstanding the rules for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature, the wording for the description of the products is to be considered as having no more than an indicative value, the preferential scheme being determined, within the context of this Annex, by the coverage of the CN codes. Where "ex" CN codes are indicated, the preferential scheme is to be determined by the application of the CN codes and corresponding description taken together. 
[3] Duty reduction only applies to ad valorem customs duties except for the products corresponding to the following codes: 01051200, 0207, 040410, 040700, 07099060, 220421and 2209. 
[4] Entry under this subheading is subject to the conditions laid down in the relevant Community provisions (Regulation (EC) No 790/2000 (OJ No L 95, 15.4.2000), and subsequent amendments. 
[5] Within this tariff quota, the specific duty provided in the Community's list of concessions to the WTO is reduced to zero, for the period from 1 December to 31 May, if the entry price is not less than EUR 264/tonne, being the entry price agreed between the European Community and Israel. If the entry price for a consignment is 2, 4, 6 or 8 % lower than the agreed entry price, the specific customs quota duty shall be equal respectively to 2, 4, 6 or 8 % of this agreed entry price. If the entry price of a consignment is less than 92 % of the agreed entry price, the specific customs duty bound within the WTO shall apply.

ANNEX II 
" 
PROTOCOL 2 
concerning the arrangements applicable to imports into Israel of agricultural products originating in the Community 
1. The products listed the Annex originating in the Community shall be admitted for importation into Israel according to the conditions contained herein and in the Annex. 
2. Import duties on imports are either eliminated or reduced to the level indicated in column "a", within the limit of the annual tariff quota listed in column "b", and subject to the specific provisions indicated in column "e". 
3. For the quantities imported in excess of the tariff quotas, the customs duties are, according to the product concerned, applied in full or reduced as indicated in column "c". 
4. For certain products for which no tariff quota is fixed, reference quantities are fixed as indicated in column "d". 
Should the volume of imports of one of the products exceed the reference quantity, Israel, having regard to an annual review of trade flows which it shall carry out, may make the product in question subject to a tariff quota, the volume of which shall be equal to the reference quantity. In that case, for quantities imported in excess of the quota, the duty referred to in point 3 shall apply. 
5. For products for which neither a tariff quota nor a reference quantity is fixed, Israel may fix a reference quantity as provided for in point 4 if, in the light of the annual review of trade flows which it shall carry out, it establishes that the volume of imports of a product or products threatens to cause difficulties on the Israeli market. If subsequently, the product is subjected to a tariff quota under the conditions set out in point 4, the provisions of point 3 shall apply. 
6. For the first year of application, the volumes of the tariff quotas and the reference quantities shall be calculated as a pro rata of the basic volumes, taking into account the part of the period elapsed before the date of entry into force of this agreement. 
7. For all the products listed in the Annex, the tariff quota and references quantity volumes are increased from 1 January 2004 to 1 January 2007, in four equal instalments, each corresponding to 3 % of these volumes.
