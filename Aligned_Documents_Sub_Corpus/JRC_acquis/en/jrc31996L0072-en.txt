COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 96/72/EC of 18 November 1996 amending Directives 66/400/EEC, 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 66/403/EEC, 69/208/EEC and 70/458/EEC on the marketing of beet seed, fodder plant seed, cereal seed, seed potatoes, seed of oil and fibre plants and vegetable seed 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas Article G of the Treaty on European Union replaced the term 'European Economic Community` by the term 'European Community`; whereas the abbreviation 'EEC` should therefore be replaced by the abbreviation 'EC`; 
Whereas the abbreviation 'EEC` appears in certain provisions of Directives 66/400/EEC (4), 66/401/EEC (5), 66/402/EEC (6), 66/403/EEC (7), 69/208/EEC (8), and 70/458/EEC (9) on the marketing of beet seed, fodder plant seed, cereal seed, seed potatoes, seed of oil and fibre plants and vegetable seed and in particular in relation to packages and the labelling of seeds; whereas it is therefore appropriate to replace the abbreviation 'EEC` by the abbreviation 'EC` in the said provisions; 
Whereas, however, large stocks of labels are usually ordered in advance and those still bearing the abbreviation 'EEC` should, for a phasing-in period, continue to be allowed to be used, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
