Mobilisation of the flexibility instrument 
European Parliament resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument according to point 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 (COM(2004)0402 — C6-0213/2004 — 2004/2087(ACI)) 
The European Parliament, 
- having regard to the Commission's proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council (COM(2004)0402 — C6-0213/2004) [1], 
- having regard to the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the revision of the financial perspective 2000-2006, presented by the Commission (COM(2004)0666), 
- having regard to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure [2], 
- having regard to the outcome of the conciliation meeting of 25 November 2004 with the Council, 
- having regard to the report of the Committee on Budgets and the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (A6-0069/2004), 
A. whereas the EU firmly supports the peace process in Northern Ireland and has prolonged the PEACE II programme, 
B. whereas a very substantial increase of decentralised agencies in heading 3 of the financial perspective was not foreseeable when the financial perspectives were adopted on 9 May 1999, 
C. whereas the possibility of EU participation in a major reconstruction programme in Iraq was also not foreseeable at that time, 
D. whereas the Commission proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council had to be modified to reflect the outcome of the conciliation meeting of 25 November 2004; 
1. Stresses its renewed support for the PEACE II programme and its financing; recalls, however, that a revision of the financial perspective sub-ceilings within heading 2, as originally proposed by the Commission, could have been an alternative solution; 
2. Stresses that the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument for the decentralised agencies in heading 3 shows the need to reach a structural solution to the ever increasing volume of funding needed for these agencies and the need to reconcile this with needs for other political priorities in the internal policies field; 
3. Stresses that the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument, provided for by point 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999, has been decided for the fifth consecutive year for heading 4 as the needs to face international crises since 2000 could not be financed within the initial ceiling of this heading; 
4. Approves the attached decision; 
5. Instructs its President to forward this resolution, including the decision annexed thereto, to the Council and Commission.
