PART ONE 
PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS 
SECTION I 
GENERAL RULES 
A. General rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature 
Classification of goods in the Combined Nomenclature shall be governed by the following principles: 
1. The titles of sections, chapters and sub-chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes and, provided such headings or notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions. 
2. (a) Any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete or unfinished, provided that, as presented, the incomplete or unfinished article has the essential character of the complete or finished article. It shall also be taken to include a reference to that article complete or finished (or falling to be classified as complete or finished by virtue of this rule), presented unassembled or disassembled. 
(b) Any reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or combinations of that material or substance with other materials or substances. Any reference to goods of a given material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or partly of such material or substance. The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance shall be according to the principles of rule 3. 
3. When, by application of rule 2(b) or for any other reason, goods are prima facie classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows: 
(a) the heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description. However, when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives a more complete or precise description of the goods; 
(b) mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, in so far as this criterion is applicable; 
(c) when goods cannot be classified by reference to 3(a) or (b), they shall be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration. 
4. Goods which cannot be classified in accordance with the above rules shall be classified under the heading appropriate to the goods to which they are most akin. 
5. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the following rules shall apply in respect of the goods referred to therein: 
(a) camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, drawing-instrument cases, necklace cases and similar containers, specially shaped or fitted to contain a specific article or set of articles, suitable for long-term use and presented with the articles for which they are intended, shall be classified with such articles when of a kind normally sold therewith. This rule does not, however, apply to containers which give the whole its essential character; 
(b) subject to the provisions of rule 5(a), packing materials and packing containers(1) presented with the goods therein shall be classified with the goods if they are of a kind normally used for packing such goods. However, this provision is not binding when such packing materials or packing containers are clearly suitable for repetitive use. 
6. For legal purposes, the classification of goods in the subheadings of a heading shall be determined according to the terms of those subheadings and any related subheading notes and, mutatis mutandis, to the above rules, on the understanding that only subheadings at the same level are comparable. For the purposes of this rule, the relative section and chapter notes also apply, unless the context requires otherwise. 
B. General rules concerning duties 
1. The customs duties applicable to imported goods originating in countries which are Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or with which the European Community has concluded agreements containing the most-favoured-nation tariff clause shall be the conventional duties shown in column 3 of the schedule of duties. Unless the context requires otherwise, these conventional duties are applicable to goods, other than those referred to above, imported from any third country. 
The conventional rates of duty reproduced in column 3 are applicable from 1 January 2004. 
When autonomous rates of duty are lower than the conventional rates of duty, the autonomous duties, shown by means of a footnote, are applicable. 
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply where special autonomous customs duties are provided for in respect of goods originating in certain countries or where preferential customs duties are applicable in pursuance of agreements. 
3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not preclude the Member States from applying customs duties other than those of the Common Customs Tariff where the application of such other duties is justified by Community law. 
4. The duties expressed as percentage rates are ad valorem duties. 
5. The symbol %quot%EA%quot% indicates that the goods concerned are chargeable with an %quot%agricultural component%quot% fixed in accordance with Annex 1. 
6. The symbol %quot%AD S/Z%quot% or %quot%AD F/M%quot% in Chapters 17 to 19 indicates that the maximum rate of duty consists of an ad valorem duty plus an additional duty for certain forms of sugar or for flour. This additional duty is fixed in accordance with the provisions of Annex 1. 
7. In Chapter 22, the symbol %quot%[fmxeuro] /% vol/hl%quot% means that a specific duty, expressed in euro, is to be calculated for each percentage volume of alcohol per hectolitre. Thus, a beverage having an alcohol content by volume of 40 % is to be charged as follows: 
- %quot%[fmxeuro] 1/% vol/hl%quot% = [fmxeuro] 1 × 40, giving a duty of [fmxeuro] 40 per hectolitre, or 
- %quot%[fmxeuro] 1/% vol/hl + [fmxeuro] 5/hl%quot% = [fmxeuro] 1 × 40 plus [fmxeuro] 5, giving a duty of [fmxeuro] 45 per hectolitre. 
Where, in addition, a minimum (MIN) value is shown, for example %quot%[fmxeuro] 1,6/% vol/hl MIN [fmxeuro] 9/hl%quot%, it means that the duty, calculated on the basis of the abovementioned rule, is to be compared with the minimum duty, for example %quot%[fmxeuro] 9/hl%quot%, and the higher of the two is to be applied. 
C. General rules applicable both to nomenclature and to duties 
1. Unless provided otherwise, the provisions relating to customs value shall be applied to determine, in addition to the value for the assessment of ad valorem customs duties, the values by reference to which the scope of certain headings or subheadings is defined. 
2. The dutiable weight, in the case of goods chargeable by weight, and the weights by reference to which the scope of certain headings or subheadings is defined, shall be taken to be: 
(a) in the case of a reference to %quot%gross weight%quot%, the aggregate weight of the goods and of all the packing materials and packing containers; 
(b) in the case of a reference to %quot%net weight%quot% or simply to %quot%weight%quot% without qualification, the weight of the goods themselves without packing materials and packing containers of any kind. 
3. The equivalent in national currencies of the euro, for Member States other than participating Member States as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98(2) (hereafter called %quot%non-participating Member States%quot%), shall be fixed in accordance with Article 18 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 82/97(4) of the European Parliament and of the Council. 
4. Goods eligible for favourable tariff treatment by reason of their end-use: 
Where the import duty applicable under the end-use arrangements to goods for a specific end-use is not lower than that which would otherwise be applicable to the goods, the said goods shall be classified in the CN code referring to the end-use and Articles 291 to 300 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 (OJ L 253, 11.10.1993) shall not apply. 
SECTION II 
SPECIAL PROVISIONS 
A. Goods for certain categories of ships, boats and other vessels and for drilling or production platforms 
1. Customs duties shall be suspended in respect of goods intended for incorporation in the ships, boats or other vessels listed in the following schedule, for the purposes of their construction, repair, maintenance or conversion, and in respect of goods intended for fitting to or equipping such ships, boats or other vessels. 
2. Customs duties shall be suspended in respect of: 
(a) goods intended for incorporation in drilling or production platforms: 
(1) fixed, of subheading ex 8430 49, operating in or outside the territorial sea of Member States, or 
(2) floating or submersible, of subheading 8905 20, 
for the purposes of their construction, repair, maintenance or conversion, and in respect of goods intended for equipping the said platforms. 
Those goods such as motor fuel, lubricants and gas, which are necessary for the operation of machines and apparatus which do not affect permanently, and are not integral parts of the platforms and which are used on board for the construction, repair, maintenance, conversion or equipping of these platforms are regarded also as being used for incorporation in drilling or production platforms; 
(b) tubes, pipes, cables and their connection pieces, linking these drilling or production platforms to the mainland. 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
3. The suspensions shall be subject to conditions laid down in the relevant Community provisions with a view to customs control of the use of such goods. 
B. Civil aircraft and goods for use in civil aircraft 
1. Relief from customs duty is provided for: 
- civil aircraft, 
- certain goods for use in civil aircraft and for incorporation therein in the course of their manufacture, repair, maintenance, rebuilding, modification or conversion, 
- ground flying-trainers and their parts, for civil use. 
These goods are covered by subheadings(5) with a footnote reference in the following terms: %quot%Entry under this subheading is subject to the conditions laid down in the relevant Community provisions (see Articles 291 to 300 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 (OJ L 253, 11.10.1993, p. 1) and subsequent amendments). See also section II, paragraph B, of the preliminary provisions.%quot% 
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, %quot%civil aircraft%quot% means aircraft other than aircraft used in military or similar services in the Member States which carry a military or non-civil registration. 
3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, second indent, the expression %quot%for use in civil aircraft%quot% in all relevant subheadings(6) shall include goods for use in ground flying trainers for civil use. 
C. Pharmaceutical products 
1. Relief from customs duty is provided for pharmaceutical products of the following categories: 
(i) pharmaceutical substances which are covered by the CAS RN (chemical abstracts service registry numbers) and the international non-proprietary names (INNs) listed in Annex 3; 
(ii) salts, esters and hydrates of INNs which are described by combining INNs of Annex 3 with prefixes or suffixes of Annex 4, provided such products are classifiable in the same 6-digit HS-subheadings as the relevant INN; 
(iii) salts, esters and hydrates of INNs which are listed in Annex 5 and which are not classifiable in the same 6-digit HS-subheadings as the corresponding INNs; 
(iv) pharmaceutical intermediates, i.e. compounds used in the manufacture of finished pharmaceutical products which are covered by the CAS RN and the chemical names, listed in Annex 6. 
2. Special cases: 
(i) INNs cover only those substances described in the lists of recommended and proposed INNs published by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Where the number of substances covered by an INN is less than that covered by the CAS RN, only those substances covered by the INN will be subject to duty-free treatment; 
(ii) where a product of Annex 3 or Annex 6 is identified by a CAS RN corresponding to a specific isomer, only that isomer may qualify for duty-free treatment; 
(iii) double derivatives (salts, esters and hydrates) of INNs identified by a combination of an INN of Annex 3 with a prefix or suffix of Annex 4 qualify for duty-free treatment, provided they are classifiable in the same 6-digit HS-subheading as the relevant INN: 
example: alanine methyl ester, hydrochloride; 
(iv) where an INN of Annex 3 is a salt (or an ester), no other salt (or ester) of the acid corresponding to the INN may qualify for duty-free treatment: 
example: oxprenoate potassium (INN): duty-free 
oxprenoate sodium: not duty-free. 
D. Standard rate of duty 
1. Customs duty shall be charged at the flat rate of 3,5 % ad valorem on goods: 
- contained in consignments sent by one private individual to another, 
or 
- contained in travellers' personal luggage, 
provided that such importations are not of a commercial nature. 
This flat-rate 3,5 % customs duty shall apply, provided that the value of the goods subject to import duty does not exceed [fmxeuro] 350 per consignment or per traveller. 
Such flat-rate assessment shall not apply to goods of Chapter 24 which are contained in a consignment or in travellers' personal luggage in amounts exceeding those laid down in Article 31 or in Article 46 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 918/83(7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 355/94(8). 
2. Importations shall be treated as not being of a commercial nature if: 
(a) in the case of goods contained in consignments sent by one private individual to another, such consignments: 
- are of an occasional nature, 
- contain goods exclusively for the personal use of the consignee or his family, which do not by their nature or quantity reflect any commercial interest, 
- are sent to the consignee by the consignor free of payment of any kind; 
(b) in the case of goods contained in travellers' personal luggage, they: 
- are of an occasional nature, 
and 
- consist exclusively of goods for the personal use of the travellers or their families, or of goods intended as presents; the nature and quantity of such goods must not be such as might indicate that they are being imported for commercial reasons. 
3. The flat rate of customs duty shall not apply to goods imported under the conditions set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 if the person entitled has, before the said flat rate is applied to them, requested that they be subject to the customs duties appropriate to them. All the goods making up the consignment shall then be subject to the import duties which are appropriate to them, without prejudice to the duty-free admission provided for pursuant to Articles 29 to 31 and 45 to 49 of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83. 
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, import duties shall mean both customs duties and charges having equivalent effect and other import charges provided for under the common agricultural policy or under specific arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products. 
4. Non-participating Member States may round off the amount in national currencies resulting from the conversion of the sum of [fmxeuro] 350. 
5. Non-participating Member States may maintain unchanged the equivalent in national currency of the sum of [fmxeuro] 350 if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in the first paragraph of Article 18(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 the conversion of this amount, before the rounding off provided for in paragraph 4, results in a change of less than 5 % in the equivalent in national currency, or in a reduction thereof. 
E. Containers and packing materials 
The following provisions are applicable to the containers and packing materials referred to in general interpretative rule 5(a) and (b) and put into free circulation at the same time as the goods which they contain or with which they are presented. 
1. When the containers and packing materials are classified with the goods in accordance with the provisions of general interpretative rule 5, they shall be: 
(a) chargeable at the same rate of customs duty as the goods: 
- where such goods are subject to an ad valorem customs duty, or 
- where they are to be included in the dutiable weight of the goods; 
(b) admitted free of customs duties: 
- where the goods are free of customs duty, or 
- where the goods are dutiable otherwise than by reference to weight or value, or 
- where the weight of the containers and packing materials is not to be included in the dutiable weight of the goods. 
2. Where containers and packing materials covered by the provisions of paragraph 1(a) and (b) contain or are presented with goods of several different tariff descriptions, the weight and value of the containers and packing materials shall, for the purpose of determining their dutiable weight or value, be apportioned among all the goods contained, in proportion to the weight or value of those goods. 
F. Favourable tariff treatment by reason of the nature of the goods 
1. Under certain conditions, favourable tariff treatment by reason of the nature of the goods is provided for: 
- goods unfit for consumption, 
- seeds, 
- bolting cloth, not made up, 
- certain types of fresh table grapes, cheese fondues, Tokay wines, tobacco and nitrate. 
These goods are covered by subheadings(9) with a footnote reference in the following terms: %quot%Entry under this subheading is subject to the conditions laid down in section II, paragraph F, of the preliminary provisions.%quot% 
2. Goods unfit for consumption for which favourable tariff treatment is granted by reason of their nature are listed in Annex 8 by reference to the heading under which they are classified together with the description and the quantities of the denaturants used. Such goods are presumed to be unfit for consumption when the goods to be denatured and the denaturants are homogeneously mixed and their separation is economically not viable. 
3. The goods listed below shall be classified in the appropriate headings for seed or for sowing, provided that the goods comply with the relevant Community provisions: 
- for sweetcorn, spelt, hybrid maize, rice and sorghum (Council Directive 66/402/EEC(10)), 
- for seed potatoes (Council Directive 2002/56/EC of 13 June 2002(11)), 
- for oil seeds and oleaginous fruits (Council Directive 2002/57/EC of 13 June 2002(12)). 
When hybrid sweetcorn, spelt, hybrid maize, rice, hybrid sorghum or oil seeds and oleaginous fruits are of a kind to which the agricultural provisions do not apply, favourable tariff treatment by reason of their nature shall be granted, provided that it is established that the goods are actually intended for sowing. 
4. Bolting cloth, not made up, is granted favourable tariff treatment on the condition that the goods are indelibly marked in a way identifying them as being intended for bolting or similar industrial purposes. 
5. Fresh table grapes, cheese fondues, Tokay wines, tobacco and nitrate are granted favourable tariff treatment on production of a duly endorsed certificate. The particular provisions to be applied and the model of the certificates are set out at Annex 9.

Additional notes 
1. For the application of note 3(b) to this chapter, the components of an ensemble must be made up entirely in a single identical fabric, subject to compliance with the other conditions laid down in the said note. 
For this purpose: 
- the fabric used can be unbleached, bleached, dyed, of yarns of different colours or printed, 
- a pullover or waistcoat with ribbing is to be considered as a component of an ensemble, even if there is no ribbing on the component intended to cover the lower part of the body, provided that the ribbing is not sewn on but produced directly by the knitting process. 
Sets of garments are not regarded as ensembles when their components are made up in different fabrics, even if the difference is due only to their respective colours. 
All the components of an ensemble must be presented together for retail sale as a single unit. Individual wrapping or separate labelling of each component of such a single unit does not influence its classification as an ensemble. 
2. For the purposes of heading 6109, the terms %quot%singlets%quot% and %quot%other vests%quot% include garments, even if of a fancy design, worn next to the body, without collar, with or without sleeves, including those with shoulder straps.

However, copper phosphide (phosphor copper) containing more than 15 % by weight of phosphorus falls in heading 2848. 
(d) Bars and rods: 
Rolled, extruded, drawn or forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including %quot%flattened circles%quot% and %quot%modified rectangles%quot%, of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including %quot%modified rectangular%quot%) cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and dimensions, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings. 
Wire-bars and billets with their ends tapered or otherwise worked simply to facilitate their entry into machines for converting them into, for example, drawing stock (wire-rod) or tubes, are however to be taken to be unwrought copper of heading 7403. 
(e) Profiles:
