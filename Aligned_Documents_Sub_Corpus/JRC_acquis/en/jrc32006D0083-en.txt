Council Decision

on the signing on behalf of the European Community and provisional application of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters extending the Protocol setting out, for the period from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006, the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe on fishing off the coast of São Tomé and Príncipe 
(2006/83/EC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 300(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) Under the terms of the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe on fishing off the coast of São Tomé and Príncipe [1], the Contracting Parties are to enter into negotiations, before the period of validity of the Protocol to the Agreement expires, to determine by mutual agreement the contents of the Protocol for the period that follows and, where applicable, the amendments or additions to be made to the Annex thereto. 
(2) Pending negotiations on changes to be made to the existing Protocol approved by Council Regulation (EC) No 2348/2002 of 9 December 2002 on the conclusion of the Protocol setting out, for the period from 1 June 2002 to 31 May 2005, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe on fishing off the coast of São Tomé and Príncipe [2], the Parties have decided to extend its validity for a further year by means of an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters. 
(3) The Exchange of Letters provides Community fishermen with fishing opportunities in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of São Tomé and Príncipe from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006. 
(4) It is essential that the extension be applied as soon as possible in order to avoid interrupting the fishing activities of Community vessels. The Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters should therefore be signed and applied on a provisional basis pending the completion of the procedures required to conclude it. 
(5) The allocation of fishing opportunities among the Member States under the expired Protocol should be confirmed, 
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
