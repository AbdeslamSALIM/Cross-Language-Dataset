THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs(1), as last amended by Directive 1999/90/EC(2), and in particular Article 23(1), 24, 26(2), 27a and 34 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC(3), as last amended by Directive 96/43/EC(4), and in particular Article 10 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Decision 96/482/EC(5), as last amended by Decision 1999/549/EC(6), lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certificates for the importation of poultry and hatching eggs other than ratites and eggs thereof from third countries including the animal health measures to be applied after such importation. 
(2) Given the experience gained during the application of the measures provided for, the conditions under which day-old chicks originating from hatching eggs which have been imported from third countries are traded within the Community should be modified. The modification should enable Member States to dispatch day-old chicks to hodlings located in another Member State ensuring that the post importation isolation is carried out. 
(3) It is necessary therefore to amend the model certificate as laid down in Annex IV to Directive 90/539/EEC and Decision 96/482/EC accordingly. 
(4) It is necessary that the competent authority of the Member State of dispatch informs the competent authority of the final destination of the day-old chicks through the Animo system about the animal health requirements concerning the isolation period which have to be applied in these cases. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,
