THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1600/83 (2), and in particular Article 12 (3) thereof, 
Whereas the voucher mentioned in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2191/81 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1446/83 (4), is to be valid only from the first day of the calender month; whereas the butter cannot be taken over until after that date; whereas experience of the scheme has shown that it is necessary to put forward that date in order to make it possible for deliveries of butter to be made earlier; whereas the period during which butter can be taken over should therefore be adjusted; whereas this provision also appears in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2192/81 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1446/83; whereas the same amendment should also be made in that Regulation; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1

This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
