EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. In the context of enlarging the customs union the provisions of GATT Article XXIV.6 oblige the EC to enter into negotiations with third countries having negotiating rights in any of the acceding Members in order to agree on compensatory adjustment if the adoption of the EC’s external tariff regime results in an increase in tariff beyond the level for which the acceding country has bound itself at the WTO, whilst taking ‘due account of reductions of duties on the same tariff line made by other constituents of the customs union upon its formation’. 
2. On 22 March 2004, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXIV.6 of the GATT 1994 (COM proposal 6792/04 WTO 34). 
3. Negotiations have been conducted by the Commission in consultation with the Committee established by Article 133 of the Treaty and within the framework of the negotiating directives issued by the Council. 
4. The Commission has negotiated with the Members of the WTO holding negotiations rights with respect to the withdrawal of specific concessions in relation to the withdrawal of the schedules of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic, in the course of the accession to the European Community.
