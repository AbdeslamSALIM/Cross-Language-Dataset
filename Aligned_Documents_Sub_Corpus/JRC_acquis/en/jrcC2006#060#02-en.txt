Judgment of the Court 
(Second Chamber) 
of 10 January 2006 
in Case C-230/03: Reference for a preliminary ruling from the Bundesverwaltungsgericht Mehmet Sedef v Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg [1] 
In Case C-230/03: reference for a preliminary ruling under Article 234 EC from the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Germany), made by decision of 18 March 2003, received at the Court on 26 May 2003, in the proceedings between Mehmet Sedef and Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg, in the presence of Vertreter des Bundesinteresses beim Bundesverwaltungsgericht — the Court (Second Chamber) composed of C.W.A. Timmermans, President of the Chamber, C. Gulman, R. Schintgen (Rapporteur), G. Arestis and J. Klučka, Judges; D. Ruiz-Jarabo Colomer, Advocate General; K. Sztranc, Administrator, for the Registrar, gave a judgment on 10 January 2006, in which it ruled: 
- enjoyment of the rights conferred on a Turkish worker by the third indent of paragraph 1 of that article presupposes in principle that the person concerned has already fulfilled the conditions set out in the second indent of that paragraph; 
- a Turkish worker who does not yet enjoy the right of free access to any paid employment of his choice under that third indent must be in legal employment without interruption in the host Member State unless he can rely on a legitimate reason of the type laid down in Article 6(2) to justify his temporary absence from the labour force; 
- Article 6(2) of Decision No 1/80 covers interruptions in periods of legal employment, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, and the relevant national authorities cannot, in this case, dispute the right of the Turkish worker concerned to reside in the host Member State.
