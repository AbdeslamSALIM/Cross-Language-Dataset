ANNEX 
THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA: 2005 EUROPEAN PARTNERSHIP 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The Thessaloniki European Council endorsed the introduction of the European Partnerships as a means of realising the European perspective of the western Balkan countries within the framework of the stabilisation and association process. 
The first Partnership with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was adopted by the Council on 14 June 2004. It is appropriate to update this first Partnership on the basis of the Commission's opinion on the application from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for membership of the European Union. The second European Partnership identifies new priorities for action. 
The new priorities are adapted to the country's specific needs and stage of preparation and will be updated as necessary. The European Partnership also provides guidance for financial assistance to the country. 
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is expected to adopt a plan including a timetable and specific measures to address the European Partnership priorities. 
2. PRINCIPLES 
The stabilisation and association process remains the framework for the European course of the western Balkan countries, all the way to their future accession. 
The main priorities identified for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia relate to its capacity to meet the criteria defined by the Copenhagen European Council of 1993 and the conditions set for the stabilisation and association process, notably the conditions defined by the Council in its conclusions of 29 April 1997 and 21 and 22 June 1999, the content of the final declaration of the Zagreb Summit of 24 November 2000 and the Thessaloniki Agenda. 
3. PRIORITIES 
The priorities listed in this European Partnership have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia can complete them or take them substantially forward over the next few years. A distinction is made between short-term priorities, which are expected to be accomplished within one to two years, and medium-term priorities, which are expected to be accomplished within three to four years. The priorities concern both legislation and the implementation thereof. 
Taking into account the substantial costs required for implementation and enforcement of the acquis as well as the complexity of the EU requirements in certain areas, this Partnership does not include all important tasks at this stage. Future Partnerships will include further priorities in line with the progress made by the country. 
Among the short-term priorities, the key priorities have been identified and grouped together at the beginning of section 3.1. The order of these key priorities does not imply any ranking in their importance.

Accordingly, this Decision will have no financial implications. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia can have access to funding from multi-country and horizontal programmes. 
5. CONDITIONALITY 
Community assistance under the stabilisation and association process to the western Balkan countries is conditional on further progress in satisfying the Copenhagen criteria as well as progress in meeting the specific priorities of this European Partnership. Failure to respect these conditions could lead the Council to take appropriate measures on the basis of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000. Community assistance will also be subject to the conditions defined by the Council in its Conclusions of 29 April 1997 and of 21 to 22 June 1999, in particular as regards the recipients' undertaking to carry out democratic, economic and institutional reforms. 
6. MONITORING
