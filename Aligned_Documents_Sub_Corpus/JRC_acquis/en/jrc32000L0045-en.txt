PART A 
DETERMINATION OF VITAMIN A 
1. Purpose and scope 
This method is for the determination of vitamin A (retinol) in feedingstuffs and premixtures. Vitamin A includes all-trans-retinyl alcohol and its cis isomers which are determined by this method. The content of vitamin A is expressed in International Units (IU) per kg. One IU corresponds to the activity of 0,300 μg all-trans-vitamin A alcohol or 0,344 μg all-trans-vitamin A acetate or 0,550 μg all-trans-vitamin A palmitate. 
The limit of determination is 2000 IU vitamin A/kg. 
2. Principle 
The sample is hydrolysed with ethanolic potassium hydroxide solution and the vitamin A is extracted into light petroleum. The solvent is removed by evaporation and the residue is dissolved in methanol and, if necessary, diluted to the required concentration. The content of vitamin A is determined by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a UV or a fluorescence detector. The chromatographic parameters are chosen so that there is no separation between the all-trans-vitamin A alcohol and its cis isomers.

5. Procedure 
Note: 
Vitamin A is sensitive to (UV) light and to oxidation. All operations should be carried out in the absence of light (using amber glassware, or glassware protected with aluminium foil) and oxygen (flush with nitrogen). During extraction air above the liquid should be replaced by nitrogen (avoid excess pressure by loosening the stopper from time to time). 
5.1. Preparation of the sample 
Grind the sample so that it passes a 1 mm mesh sieve, taking care to avoid generation of heat. Grinding must be carried out immediately before weighing and saponification otherwise there may be losses of vitamin A. 
5.2. Saponification 
Depending on the vitamin A content weigh, to the nearest 0,01 g, 2 g to 25 g of the sample into a 500 ml flat bottom or conical flask (4.2.1). Add successively with swirling 130 ml ethanol (3.1), approximately 100 mg BHT (3.13), 2 ml sodium ascorbate solution (3.5) and 2 ml sodium sulfide solution (3.6). Fit a condenser (4.3) to the flask and immerse the flask in a water-bath with magnetic stirrer (4.7). Heat to boiling and allow to reflux for five minutes. Then add 25 ml potassium hydroxide solution (3.4) through the condenser (4.3) and allow to reflux for a further 25 min, with stirring under a slow stream of nitrogen. Then rinse the condenser with approximately 20 ml water and cool the content of the flask to room temperature. 
5.3. Extraction 
Transfer by decantation the saponification solution quantitatively by rinsing with a total volume of 250 ml water to a 1000 ml separating funnel (4.2.3) or to the extraction apparatus (4.8). Rinse the saponification flask successively with 25 ml ethanol (3.1) and 100 ml light petroleum (3.2) and transfer the rinsings to the separating funnel or to the extraction apparatus. The proportion of water and ethanol in the combined solutions should be about 2:1. Shake vigorously for two minutes and allow to settle for two minutes. 
5.3.1. Extraction using a separating funnel (4.2.3) 
When the layers have separated (see observation 7.3) transfer the light petroleum layer to another separating funnel (4.2.3). Repeat this extraction twice, with 100 ml light petroleum (3.2) and twice, with 50 ml light petroleum (3.2). 
Wash the combined extracts in the separating funnel twice by gently swirling (to avoid formation of emulsions) with 100 ml portions of water and then by repeated shaking with further 100 ml portions of water until the water remains colourless on addition of phenolphthalein solution (3.7) (washing four times is usually sufficient). Filter the washed extract through a dry pleated filter for phase separation (4.4) to remove any suspended water into a 500 ml graduated flask (4.2.2). Rinse the separating funnel and the filter with 50 ml light petroleum (3.2), make up to the mark with light petroleum (3.2) and mix well. 
5.3.2. Extraction using an extraction apparatus (4.8) 
When the layers have separated (see observation 7.3) replace the stopper of the glass cylinder (4.8.1) by the ground glass insert (4.8.2) and position the U-shaped lower end of the adjustable tube so that it is just above the level of the interface. By application of pressure from a nitrogen line to the side-arm, transfer the upper light petroleum-layer to a 1000 ml separating funnel (4.2.3). Add 100 ml light petroleum (3.2) to the glass cylinder, stopper and shake well. Allow the layers to separate and transfer the upper layer to the separating funnel as before. Repeat the extraction procedure with further 100 ml of light petroleum (3.2), then twice with 50 ml portions of light petroleum (3.2) and add the light petroleum layers to the separating funnel. 
Wash the combined light petroleum extracts as described in 5.3.1 and proceed as described there. 
5.4. Preparation of the sample solution for HPLC 
Pipette an aliquot portion of the light petroleum solution (from 5.3.1 or 5.3.2) into a 250 ml pear shaped flask (4.2.4). Evaporate the solvent nearly to dryness on the rotary evaporator (4.1) with reduced pressure at a bath temperature not exceeding 40 °C. Restore atmospheric pressure by admitting nitrogen (3.10) and remove the flask from the rotary evaporator. Remove the remaining solvent with a stream of nitrogen (3.10) and dissolve the residue immediately in a known volume (10-100 ml) of methanol (3.3) (the concentration of vitamin A should be in the range of 5 IU/ml to 30 IU/ml). 
5.5. Determination by HPLC 
Vitamin A is separated on a C18 reversed phase column (4.5.1) and the concentration is measured by means of a UV detector (325 nm) or a fluorescence detector (excitation: 325 nm, emission: 475 nm) (4.5.2). 
Inject an aliquot portion (e.g. 20 μl) of the methanolic solution obtained in 5.4 and elute with the mobile phase (3.9). Calculate the mean peak height (area) of several injections of the same sample solution and the mean peak heights (areas) of several injections of the calibration solutions (5.6.2).

6. Calculation of the results 
From the mean height (area) of the vitamin A peaks of the sample solution determine the concentration of the sample solution in IU/ml by reference to the calibration graph (5.6.2). 
The vitamin A content w in IU/kg of the sample is given by the following formula: 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000174EN.003701.EPS%quot%%gt% 
in which: 
β= vitamin A concentration of the sample solution (5.4) in IU/ml 
V1= volume of sample solution (5.4) in ml 
V2= volume of aliquot taken in 5.4 in ml 
m= mass of the test portion in g 
7. Observations 
7.1. For samples with low vitamin A concentration it may be useful to combine the light petroleum-extracts of two saponification-charges (amount weighed: 25 g) to one sample solution for HPLC-determination. 
7.2. The weight of the sample taken for the analysis should not contain more than 2 g fat. 
7.3. If phase separation does not occur add approximately 10 ml ethanol (3.1) to break the emulsion. 
7.4. With cod-liver oil and other pure fats the saponification time should be extended to 45-60 minutes. 
7.5. Hydroquinone can be used instead of BHT. 
7.6. Using a normal phase-column the separation of retinol isomers is possible. 
7.7. Approximately 150 mg ascorbic acid can be used instead of sodium ascorbate solution. 
7.8. Approximately 50 mg EDTA can be used instead of sodium sulfide solution. 
8. Repeatability 
The difference between the results of two parallel determinations carried out on the same sample must not exceed 15 % relative to the higher result.

6. Calculation of the results 
From the mean height (area) of the vitamin E peaks of the sample solution determine the concentration of the sample solution in μg/ml (calculated as α-tocopherol acetate) by reference to the calibration graph (5.6.1.2 or 5.6.2.2). 
The vitamin E content w in mg/kg of the sample is given by the following formula: 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000174EN.004203.EPS%quot%%gt% 
in which: 
β= vitamin E concentration of the sample solution (5.4) in μg/ml 
V1= volume of sample solution (5.4) in ml 
V2= volume of aliquot taken in 5.4 in ml 
m= mass of the test portion in g 
7. Observations 
7.1. For samples with low vitamin E concentration it may be useful to combine the light petroleum-extracts of two saponification-charges (amount weighed: 25 g) to one sample solution for HPLC-determination. 
7.2. The weight of the sample taken for the analysis should not contain more than 2 g fat. 
7.3. If phase separation does not occur add approximately 10 ml ethanol (3.1) to break the emulsion. 
7.4. After the spectrophotometric measurement of the DL-α-tocopherol acetate or DL-α-tocopherol solution according to 5.6.1.3 or 5.6.2.3 respectively add approximately 10 mg BHT (3.12) to the solution (3.10.1 or 3.10.2) and keep the solution in a refrigerator (storage life maximum of four weeks). 
7.5. Hydroquinone can be used instead of BHT. 
7.6. Using a normal phase-column the separation of α-, β-, χ- and δ-tocopherol is possible. 
7.7. Approximately 150 mg ascorbic acid can be used instead of sodium ascorbate solution. 
7.8. Approximately 50 mg EDTA can be used instead of sodium sulfide solution.

DETERMINATION OF TRYPTOPHAN 
1. Purpose and scope 
The method is for the determination of the total and free tryptophan in feedingstuffs. It does not distinguish between D- and L- forms. 
2. Principle 
For the determination of the total tryptophan, the sample is hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions with saturated barium hydroxide solution and heated to 110.oC for 20 hours. After hydrolysis internal standard is added. 
For the determination of free tryptophan, the sample is extracted under mild acidic conditions in the presence of internal standard. 
The tryptophan and the internal standard in the hydrolysate or in the extract are determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection.

5. Procedure 
5.1. Preparation of samples 
The sample is ground to pass through a 0,5 mm sieve. Samples high in moisture must be either air-dried at a temperature not exceeding 50.oC or freeze dried prior to grinding. Samples with high fat content should be extracted with light petroleum (3.9) prior to grinding. 
5.2. Determination of free tryptophan (extract) 
Weigh to the nearest 1 mg an appropriate amount (1-5 g) of the prepared sample (5.1), into a conical flask. Add 100,0 ml hydrochloric acid, c = 0,1 mol/l (3.13) and 5,00 ml concentrated internal standard solution (3.16). Shake or mix for 60 min. using a mechanical shaker or a magnetic stirrer (4.7). Allow the sediment to settle and pipette 10,0 ml of the supernatant solution into a beaker. Add 5 ml ortho-phosphoric acid, c = 0,5 mol/l (3.14). Adjust the pH to 3,0 using sodium hydroxide, c = 1,0 mol/l (3.10). Add sufficient methanol (3.8) to give a concentration of between 10 and 30 % of methanol in the final volume. Transfer to a volumetric flask of appropriate volume and dilute with water to a volume necessary for the chromatography (approximately the same volume as the calibration standard solution (3.17)). 
Filter a few ml of the solution through a 0,45 μm membrane filter (4.5) before injection on the HPLC column. Proceed to the chromatography step according to paragraph 5.4. 
Protect standard solution and extracts against direct sunlight. If it is not possible to analyse the extracts the same day, the extracts may be stored at 5.oC for a maximum of three days. 
5.3. Determination of total tryptophan (hydrolysate). 
Weigh to the nearest 0,2 mg from 0,1 to 1 g of the prepared sample (5.1) into the polypropylene flask (4.4). The weighed sample portion should have a nitrogen content of about 10 mg. Add 8,4 g barium hydroxide octa-hydrate (3.4) and 10 ml water. Mix on a vortex mixer (4.8) or magnetic stirrer (4.7) Leave the teflon coated magnet in the mixture. Wash down the walls of the vessel with 4 ml water. Put on the screw cap and close the flask loosely. Transfer to an autoclave (4.6) with boiling water and steam for 30-60 minutes. Close the autoclave and autoclave at 110 (+- 2).oC for 20 hours. 
Before opening the autoclave reduce the temperature to just under 100.oC. In order to avoid crystallisation of Ba(OH)2 ·8 H2O, add to the warm mixture 30 ml water which is at room temperature. Shake or stir gently. Add 2,00 ml concentrated internal standard (α-methyl-tryptophan) solution (3.16). Cool the vessels on water/ice bath for 15 minutes. 
Then, add 5 ml ortho-phosphoric acid, c = 0,5 mol/l (3.14). Keep the vessel in the cooling bath and neutralise with HCl, c = 6 mol/l (3.11) whilst stirring and adjust the pH to 3,0 using HCl, c = 1 mol/l (3.12). Add sufficient methanol to give a concentration of between 10 and 30 % of methanol in the final volume. Transfer to a volumetric flask of appropriate volume and dilute with water to the defined volume necessary for the chromatography (for example 100 ml). The addition of methanol should not cause precipitation. 
Filter a few ml of the solution through a 0,45 μm membrane filter (4.5) before injection on the HPLC column. Proceed to the chromatography step according to paragraph 5.4. 
Protect standard solution and hydrolysates against direct sunlight. If it is not possible to analyse the hydrolysates the same day, they may be stored at 5.oC for a maximum of three days.

9. Observations 
9.1. Following special chromatographic conditions may give better separation between tryptophan and α-methyl-tryptophan. 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
9.2. The chromatography will vary according to the type of HPLC and column packing material used. The chosen system must be capable of giving baseline separation between the tryptophan and the internal standard. Moreover it is important that degradation products are well separated from the tryptophan and the internal standard. Hydrolysates without internal standard should be run in order to check the base line under the internal standard for impurities. It is important that the run time is sufficiently long for the elution of all the degradation products, otherwise late eluting peaks may interfere with subsequent chromatographic runs. 
In the range of operation, the chromatographic system should give linear response. The linear response should be measured with a constant (the normal) concentration of the internal standard and varying concentrations of tryptophan. It is of importance that the size of both the tryptophan and internal standard peaks are within the linear range of the HPLC/fluorescence system. If either the tryptophan and/or the internal standard peak(s) is (are) too small or too high the analysis should be repeated with another sample size and/or a changed final volume. 
9.3. Barium hydroxide 
With age barium hydroxide becomes more difficult to dissolve. This results in an unclear solution for the HPLC determination, which may produce low results for tryptophan.
