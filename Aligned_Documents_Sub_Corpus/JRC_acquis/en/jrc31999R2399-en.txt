COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2399/1999 
of 11 November 1999 
amending Regulation (EC) No 1370/95 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the pigmeat sector 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3290/94(2), and in particular Article 8(2), Article 13(12) and Article 22 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1370/95(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1719/98(4), lays down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the pigmeat sector; 
(2) the present provisions on the term of validity of export licences lead to an artificial increase in applications for licences at the beginning of each month, which complicates the weekly administration of the arrangements. The term of validity should accordingly be fixed in days rather than months; 
(3) any special measures taken by the Commission where applications are made for abnormal quantities should be adjusted according to the category of the products and the destination; 
(4) in the light of experience gained, the procedure provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1370/95 for issuing licences immediately should be simplified and guarantees provided as regards the issuing to operators and the validity of such licences. However, such licences should be restricted to short-term commercial transactions in order to prevent the mechanism provided for in Article 3 of that Regulation from being circumvented; 
(5) the rules on communications between the Member States and the Commission should be brought into line with the amendments to the arrangements on licences issued immediately; 
(6) the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,
