amending Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Article 33 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In order that the distillation measure laid down in Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 can apply to as many growers as possible, a decision has been taken to postpone the opening of the measure from 1 September to 16 October 2001. To make the measure more effective, distillers who need alcohol quickly and who therefore wish to begin distillation operations as quickly as possible should be allowed to do so by the rapid approval of distillation contracts up to a certain percentage. That amendment must apply from the date on which the distillation measure opens. 
(2) Article 93 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1660/2001(4), lays down the detailed rules for the public sale of vinous alcohol for disposal with a view to its use as bioethanol in the Community. Given experience to date, certain rules should be amended, including those concerning the volume of the lots put up for sale and the deadline for removal of the alcohol. 
(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
