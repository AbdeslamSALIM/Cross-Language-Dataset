A harmonised system for the declaration by Member States of the amount of the aid paid for those purposes should therefore be established. 
(6) With a view to the overall monitoring and evaluation of the impact of joint enterprises, a list should be drawn up of relevant and comparable data, to be sent to the Commission at the same time as the reports referred to in Article 8(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999.

(1) This indicator may be used for vessels less than 24 metres between perpendiculars only, and only up to 31.12.2003 (see rules on tonnage measurement). 
(2) This indicator must be used: 
- for vessels over 24 metres between perpendiculars from 1.1.2000, and 
- for all vessels from 1.1.2004, 
(see rules on tonnage measurement) 
(3) This indicator refers to power declared in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2090/98 (engine power). 
(4) All vessels constructed (measure 21) must have their tonnage measured in GT, and the tonnage of all modernised vessels (mesure 22) must be remeasured in GT (Annex IV, point 1.4(a) to Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999). The indicator GRT must not be used, therefore, for newly built or modernised vessels. If modernisation does not entail any increase in tonnage, the corresponding quantity is 0. 
(5) This indicator refers to the total power of the vessel's new engine, and not to the increase in power as a result of the new engine. If modernisation does not include a new engine, the corresponding quantity is 0. 
(6) In this measure, an action may include all the projects in a given NUTS III level region; in that case, the relevant quantity is an aggregate. 
(7) In aquaculture/processing, a unit = a fishfarm/a processing plant or workshop. 
(8) The indicators for this action refer to the physical production capacity of the units built (or the increase in physical production capacity as a result of the extension of existing units) and not the quantity actually produced in the first year. 
(9) In this measure, an action may combine all the projects in a programme; in that case, replace in the table in Annex I to this Regulation the NUTS III code by the NUTS code for the Member State (column 4) and give the aggregate quantities. 
(10) Within the meaning of Rules No 8 (venture capital and loan funds), No 9 (guarantee funds) and No 10.2 (aid via lessor) in Regulation (EC) No 1685/2000. 
(11) This number of days applies equally to vessels and fishermen. 
(12) Within the meaning of the categories of expenditure referred to in point 2 of Rule No 11 (costs incurred in managing and implementing the Structural Funds) of Regulation (EC) No 1685/2000.
