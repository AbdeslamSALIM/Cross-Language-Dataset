Title of aid scheme or name of company receiving individual aid : Mr H.J.W.M. Bruls, dairy farmer 
Legal Basis : 
Algemene subsidieverordening 2004 
Nadere subsidieregels ontwikkeling landelijk gebied 
Annual expenditure planned or overall amount of aid granted to the company : Once-only provincial subsidy of EUR 245000. An advance of up to 80 % can be made available. Final settlement will take place no later than in 2008 
Maximum aid intensity : 
The total cost of renovation amounts to EUR 382000. The aid rate amounts to 64,1 %. The EUR 245000 subsidy lies below the permitted aid rate of 100 % of actual costs. Pursuant to Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2004, the aid is granted for investment and capital works which are aimed at conserving non-productive heritage features of agricultural holdings such as archaeological or historical features. 
The amount is also lower than the permitted aid rate of 40 % of eligible expenditure for portions of the works which result in an increasing production capacity or for which contemporary materials are used. Pursuant to Article 5(2) and (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1/2004, additional aid may be granted at a rate of up to 100 % to cover the extra costs incurred by using traditional materials necessary to maintain the heritage features of the building 
Date of implementation : The decision concerning the granting of the subsidy will be despatched four weeks after the EU has confirmed reception of this notice 
Duration of scheme or individual aid award : From June 2006 to 1 December 2008 
Objective of aid : 
Pursuant to Article 5(3) of Regulation 1/2004, the objective of the aid is to contribute towards the renovation budget of Bovenste Hoeve Printhagen, historical farm classified as national monument. The renovation forms part of a project to re-establish the dairy farm at its previous location. The renovation and restoration involves reusing existing materials and working with traditional materials. Therefore complementary aid of up to 100 % may be granted to cover the extra costs incurred by using traditional materials that are necessary to maintain the heritage features of the building. 
Another reason for granting the subsidy is that it furthers additional objectives, such as nature conservation, conservation of the main ecological structure and restoration of the original tree-lines along the driveway 
Sector(s) concerned : The aid is granted to an operator in the production sector, a dairy farmer
