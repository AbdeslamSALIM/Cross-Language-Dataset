DETAILS FOR THE SUBMISSION OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE MONITORING METHODS APPLIED AND THE RESULTS OF EVALUATION/INTERPRETATION OBTAINED ON NATIONAL LEVEL 
I. General remarks 
In addition to the submission of the data from the intensive monitoring of forest ecosystems, Member States shall prepare and submit to the Commission a document with the background information on the monitoring methods applied (Data Accompanying Report, DAR) and an annual report on the progress made in the interpretation/evaluation of results on national level (annual progress report). 
The DAR consists of two parts: the part describing the actually applied methods of the sampling lay-out, the equipment used, the assessment, the analysis, etc. (for details see paragraph II.1) and the part on exceptions and disturbances encountered (for details see paragraph II.2). 
Member States shall submit to the Commission every year a report on progress made in the interpretation/evaluation of results on national level, starting from 1997 onwards. This report shall comprise 
- information on the achievements of the National Focal Centre (NFC) itself, 
- an (up-dated) description of the national evaluation strategy, 
- a summary of the results achieved on national level, and 
- information on publications made in this field on national or international level by the NFC or other institutions involved. 
Recommendations for interpretation and evaluation of results on national level are given below in paragraph III. 
II. Data Accompanying Report 
II.1 Part of the DAR describing the methods actually applied, etc. 
This part of the DAR describes the sampling lay-out methods actually applied, the equipment used, the assessment, the analysis, etc. The following details are given: 
Inventory/Sampling methods 
In many surveys of the intensive monitoring of forest ecosystems there is a large freedom in the selection of equipment, sampling depths, timing, intensity of the survey, etc. The details of the equipment actually applied, the actual depth, timing and frequency of the survey/sampling shall be stated. Whenever samples have been taken, details on this sampling including the storage and transport, shall be stated. 
Any applied control measurements shall be described in short. 
Methods for analysis and calculation of results 
With regard to the analysis of samples, details of the preparation of the samples and methods applied in the analysis shall be given. In most surveys, certain methods for preparation and analysis are recommended. Whenever methods different from the recommended methods have been applied, exact details of these methods shall be given including possibilities for (re-) calculation of the obtained data. Any applied control measurements (participation in ring tests, etc.) shall be described in short. 
As a basis for the description of the methods, the DAR questionnaires that have been developed by Forest Intensive Monitoring Coordination Institute of the European Commission, in close collaboration with the chairmen of the expert panels of ICP Forests (UN/ECE), can be used for the general description of the data assessment. The information submitted with the help of the DAR questionnaires will remain valid over the years until the applied methods are changed. 
Special attention shall be given to observe and document changes in the applied methods of the inventory, transport and analysis. Regional differences shall be stated and explained in full detail (e.g. different laboratories used for analysis). 
II.2 Part of the DAR dealing with exceptions and disturbances encountered (annual DAR) 
In addition to the general information on the methods described by using the DAR questionnaire, the specific problems, exceptions, disturbances and validation problems of the data submitted each year, are to be described. 
Exceptions and disturbances 
Exceptional situations and important disturbances from the routine shall be reported. Besides the description of the applied methods for the sampling, analysis, etc., as presented in the DAR questionnaires, good documentation of the exceptions, exceptional situations and disturbances is needed. This will be documented in an annual DAR report and submitted to the Commission together with the submitted data. 
Data validation and data management 
The procedures applied for data quality control shall be given, including limits of data rejection (plausibility checks) as well as the procedures that have been applied to check the consistency of the national data sets. 
When gaps exist in the data, estimates based on results from other sources can be made in certain cases. These estimated data shall be indicated and the used assumptions shall be carefully documented. 
III. Annual report on progress made in the interpretation/evaluation of results on national level 
This report provides information on progress made in the interpretation/evaluation of results on national level. For the interpretation/evaluation of results on national level the following details are given: 
General information 
Member States shall execute an evaluation and interpretation of the monitoring data on national level. 
Member States are free to decide which evaluation and interpretation is carried out on national level and reported to the Commission. However, the following suggestions are given for this evaluation: 
Single survey evaluation and interpretation 
Whenever results from earlier surveys are available an attempt should be made to determine trends. The results of the single survey should be reviewed and compared to results from other (similar) surveys carried out in the (same) region/country. Differences and similarities are to be indicated and when applicable the differences should be evaluated. Also relevant data from other sources, which could explain certain relations in parameters should be included in the evaluation here. 
Integrated evaluation and interpretation 
With the completion of the different surveys, possibilities arise for integrated evaluation. In the NFC, all survey results and evaluation reports are collected. The NFC shall coordinate the integrated evaluation and the interpretation of the different survey results on national level. 
Evaluation and interpretation with external data 
The results of the integrated evaluation and interpretation found should be reviewed and compared to results from other sources. Differences and similarities should be noted and explained whenever possible. 
IV. Timing for the submission of the DAR and the report on progress made in the interpretation/evaluation of results on national level 
IV.1 Timing for the DAR 
The DAR questionnaire shall be completed and submitted to the Commission with the first data submission. If the methods are changed the information on the changes shall be submitted. The part of the DAR dealing with descriptions of noted disturbances and exceptions shall be submitted to the Commission together with the annually submitted data. 
IV.2 Timing for the report on progress made in the interpretation/evaluation of results on national level 
Progress reports on evaluations and interpretations carried out on national level shall be forwarded to the Commission before 31 December each year.` 
ANNEX V 
'ANNEX X 
COMMON METHODS FOR SOIL SOLUTION MONITORING ON THE PERMANENT OBSERVATION PLOTS 
I. General remarks 
Monitoring of soil solution is to be carried out on at least 10 % of permanent observation plots. It is recommended that soil solution be monitored on plots where deposition is also monitored. Installation of the soil solution equipment shall be completed by 30 June 1998. 
This Annex is based on technical recommendations of the Soil Expert Panel of the UN/ECE International Cooperative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP Forests). Reference is made to the sub-manual (1996) prepared by this expert panel. 
II. Inventory methodology 
II.1 Selection of sample location 
Soil solution samplers should be installed close to where crown condition assessment is conducted. It is recommended that the lysimeters be randomly or systematically distributed over the whole plot although this may be limited by the presence of stones or stems (distance from a tree is not specified). Because of disturbances to the soil, zero-tension lysimeters should not be installed in the central part of the plot where tree parameters are monitored. For practical reasons, a representative subplot can be used. Lysimeters that have already been installed can be maintained, but new installations should be made as proposed above. 
II.2 Sampling depths 
It is recommended that the lysimeters be installed at fixed depths but installation by horizons is also acceptable. 
- Soil solution collectors 
It is strongly advised that lysimeters be placed at at least two depths, i.e one within the rooting zone (suggested depth is 10 to 20 cm) to gain insight into concentrations of nutrients and toxic elements near the fine roots (aim 1) and one below the rooting zone (suggested depth is 40-80 cm), to estimate the element output (aim 2). It is also advised that a third lysimeter be placed immediately below the humus layer. 
- Soil samples 
If centrifugation or saturation extract methods are used, the soil layers to be sampled are those mentioned in the soil manual: humus layer, 0 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 40 and 40 - 80 cm. A selection or aggregation of some layers can be made. 
II.3 Sampling frequency 
On plots where other intensive monitoring programmes are carried out, e.g. deposition and meteorological measurements, the sampling of the soil solution should be done monthly or bi-weekly. In case of soil sampling followed by extraction of the soil solution, four times per year is a maximum because of the destructive sampling procedure. Sampling should be done at the same month of the year. 
II.4 Transport, storage and preparation 
The samples shall be transported and stored in such a way that chemical changes are minimized. 
Cool (4 Â°C) and dark storage of the soil solution within the lysimeter system will diminish biological activity. In many cases, and especially during colder season, keeping the bottle dark is sufficient. Organic or inorganic preservatives may be used, but they may interfere with the analysis. To diminish possible changes in the samples, the soil solution should be collected as soon as possible after the suction has been applied. 
Transport and storage procedures (including waiting periods) shall be reported. Where applicable the problems and deviations of these procedures shall be reported in detail. 
For determination of trace metals, aliquots of the sample should be transported to the laboratory in acid washed bottles. 
If soil samples are collected, they should be kept cool in plastic or polyethylene bags and stored at 4 Â°C until centrifugation or the preparation of the saturation extract. Centrifugation or extraction should take place within one day (18 - 30 hours) after collection of the soil samples. 
II.5 General background Information 
The following information shall be collected: 
- plot number, 
- information on sampler (type, depth), 
- first date of monitoring period, 
- last date of monitoring period, 
- number of (equal) measuring periods in monitoring period. 
II.6 Analysis methods 
In the %quot%Sub-manual on soil solution collection and analysis%quot% prepared by the Soil Expert Panel of the ICP-Forests, the approved methods for the analysis of the various soil solution parameters are described. 
It is advised that the approved methods be used. If other (national) methods are applied, comparability of the analysis results shall be reported in detail together with the presentation of the analysis results. The inventory of the forest soil solution monitoring will distinguish between mandatory and optional parameters (See list below).
