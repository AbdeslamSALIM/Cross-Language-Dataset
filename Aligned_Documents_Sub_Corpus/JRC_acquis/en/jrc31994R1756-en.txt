Commission Regulation (EC) No 1756/94 of 18 July 1994 opening quantitative import quotas for textile products in categories 122, 123, 124, 125 B, 140 and 146 C from the People's Republic of China and amending Annexes IV and V of Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries 
COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1756/94 of 18 July 1994 opening quantitative import quotas for textile products in categories 122, 123, 124, 125 B, 140 and 146 C from the People's Republic of China and amending Annexes IV and V of Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from third countries not covered by agreement, protocols or other bilateral arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules (1), and in particular Articles 3 (3) and 3 (5) thereof in conjunction with Article 25 (4) thereof, 
Whereas Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 stipulates that the textile products set out in Annex V originating in the countries listed may only be imported if an annual quantitative limit has been set in accordance with the appropriate procedure provided for by Article 25; 
Whereas a request has been put to the Commission by six Member States for the introduction import quotas covering products in categories 122, 123, 124, 125 B, 140 and 146 C from the People's Republic of China in order to meet certain market demands; whereas the committee set up by Article 25 has, after discussion, deemed it appropriate in view of the state of the Community industry to decide upon 130, 5, 600, 8, 100 and 270 tonnes respectively as the annual quantitative limits to which imports into the Community of products in categories 122, 123, 124, 125 B, 140 and 146 C originating in the People's Republic of China shall be subject as from the date on which this Regulation comes into force; whereas it is therefore necessary to amend Annexes IV and V to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 and to stipulate, in the interests of legal security that the quota shall be administered in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 17 of the said Council Regulation; 
Whereas these measures are in line with the opinion of the Committee established by Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Imports into the Community of textile products in categories 122, 123, 124, 125 B, 140 and 146 C from the People's Republic of China shall be subject to annual quantitative limits of 130, 5, 600, 8, 100 and 270 tonnes respectively to be administered in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 17 of Council Regulation No 517/94.
