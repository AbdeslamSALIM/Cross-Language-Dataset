COM(2006) 792 final 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
appointing members of the European Social Fund Committee 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
Renewal of the membership of the European Social Fund Committee 
1 Article 104 of Regulation 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that the Commission shall be assisted by a Committee set up under Article 147 of the Treaty. 
2. The provisions relating to the organisation and tasks of this Committee are also laid down in the same Article of this Council Regulation. 
3. This Article provides that the Committee shall be composed of one government representative, one representative of the workers' organisations and one representative of the employers' organisations from each Member State. For each Member State, an alternate shall be appointed for each category of representative. The members and alternates are appointed by the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission for a period of three years. 
4. The Council decided, on 24 September 2004, to appoint the members and alternate members of the European Social Fund Committee, on a proposal from the Commission for the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2007. Under the previous Regulations, the Committee was composed of two members and one alternate for each category of representative. 
During this period, additional decisions have been taken by the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, to replace members and alternate members of the Committee. The term of office of these replacements also expires on 30 April 2007. 
5. Given the change in the composition of the Committee, and the revised mandate of the Committee for the period 2007-13, and having consulted the Member States, the Commission submits to the Council the present proposal for a Council Decision appointing members and alternate members of the European Social Fund Committee for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009. 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
appointing members of the European Social Fund Committee 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 147 thereof, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No. 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999[1], and in particular Article 104(3) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) Under Council Decision 2005/C 252/01 of 24 September 2004 renewing the membership of the European Social Fund Committee (hereinafter – "the Committee"), the term of office of the members expires on 30 April 2007. 
(2) Article 104(2) of Regulation (EC) No. 1083/2006 sets out different requirements for the nomination of representatives and their alternates from those laid down in Article 49(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down provisions on the Structural Funds[2], therefore, the composition of the Committee should be respectively adjusted. 
(3) It is however appropriate that the Committee continues to carry out its tasks under its present set up till the end of the 2000-2006 programming period and the new set-up becomes operational only as from 1 January 2007. 
(4) Pending nomination of a representative and/or an alternate member for one of the categories referred to in Article 104(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 by Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece and the United Kingdom, already nominated representatives and alternate members for the Committee should nevertheless be appointed in view of the start of the 2007-2013 programming period. 
(5) The members and alternate members of the Committee should therefore be appointed for a period of three years, 
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: 
Article 1 
The persons listed in the Annex are hereby appointed members and alternate members of the European Social Fund Committee for the period 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009. 
Article 2 
Decision 2005/C 252/01 is repealed from 31 December 2006. 
Article 3 
This Decision shall be published, for information, in the Official Journal of the European Union .
