Common Position No 15/2006 
adopted by the Council on 24 July 2006 
with a view to adopting a Decision No …/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of … establishing an action programme in the field of lifelong learning 
(2006/C 251 E/03) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 149(4) and 150(4) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1], 
Having regard to the Opinion of the Committee of the Regions [2], 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [3], 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Decision 1999/382/EC [4] established the second phase of the Community vocational training action programme "Leonardo da Vinci". 
(2) Decision No 253/2000/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [5] established the second phase of the Community action programme in the field of education "Socrates". 
(3) Decision No 2318/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [6] established a multi-annual programme for the effective integration of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education and training systems in Europe (eLearning programme). 
(4) Decision No 791/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [7] established a Community action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of education and training and to support specific activities in this field. 
(5) Decision No 2241/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [8] established a single framework for the transparency of qualifications and competences (Europass). 
(6) Decision No 2317/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [9] established a programme for the enhancement of quality in higher education and the promotion of intercultural understanding through cooperation with third countries (Erasmus Mundus) (2004 to 2008). 
(7) The Bologna Declaration, signed by the Ministers for Education of 29 European countries on 19 June 1999, established an intergovernmental process aimed at creating a "European Area of Higher Education" by 2010, which requires support at Community level. 
(8) The Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 set a strategic goal for the European Union to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion, and invited the Education Council to undertake a general reflection on the concrete future objectives of education systems, focusing on common concerns and priorities while respecting national diversity. 
(9) An advanced knowledge society is the key to higher growth and employment rates. Education and training are essential priorities for the European Union in order to achieve the Lisbon goals. 
(10) On 12 February 2001 the Council adopted a report on the concrete future objectives of education and training systems. On 14 June 2002 it subsequently adopted a detailed work programme on the follow-up of these objectives, requiring support at Community level. 
(11) The Göteborg European Council of 15 and 16 June 2001 agreed a strategy for sustainable development and added an environmental dimension to the Lisbon process for employment, economic reform and social cohesion. 
(12) The Barcelona European Council of 15 and 16 March 2002 set the objective of making European Union education and training systems a world quality reference by 2010, and called for action to improve the mastery of basic skills, in particular by teaching at least two foreign languages from a very early age. 
(13) The Commission Communication and the Council Resolution of 27 June 2002 [10] on lifelong learning affirm that lifelong learning should be enhanced by actions and policies developed within the framework of Community programmes in this field. 
(14) The Council Resolution of 19 December 2002 [11] established a process of enhanced European cooperation in vocational education and training, requiring support at Community level. The Copenhagen Declaration, agreed by the Ministers for Education of 31 European countries on 30 November 2002, associated the social partners and the candidate countries with this process. 
(15) The Commission Communication on the Action Plan for skills and mobility noted the continuing need for action at European level to improve the recognition of education and training qualifications. 
(16) The Commission Communication on the Action Plan promoting language learning and linguistic diversity set out actions to be taken at European level during the period from 2004 to 2006 and requires follow-up action. 
(17) Promoting the teaching and learning of languages and linguistic diversity should be a priority of Community action in the field of education and training. The teaching and learning of languages is of special relevance among neighbouring Member States. 
(18) The interim evaluation reports of the existing Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes and the public consultation on the future of Community activity in education and training revealed a strong and in some respects growing need for continuing cooperation and mobility in these fields at European level. The reports emphasised the importance of creating closer links between Community programmes and policy developments in education and training, expressed the wish that Community action should be structured so as to respond better to the lifelong learning paradigm, and pressed for a simpler, more user-friendly and more flexible approach to implementing such action. 
(19) Following the principle of sound financial management, the implementation of the programme may be simplified by recourse to lump sum funding, in respect either of support awarded to programme participants or of Community support for the structures established at national level for the administration of the programme. 
(20) Significant advantages would accrue from integrating Community support for transnational cooperation and mobility in the fields of education and training into a single programme, which would permit greater synergies between the different fields of action and offer more capacity to support developments in lifelong learning and more coherent, streamlined and efficient modes of administration. A single programme would also encourage better cooperation between the various levels of education and training. 
(21) A Lifelong Learning Programme should therefore be established to contribute through lifelong learning to the development of the European Union as an advanced knowledge society, with sustainable economic development, more and better jobs and greater social cohesion. 
(22) Given the specificities of the schools, higher education, vocational training and adult education sectors, and the consequent need for Community action to be based on objectives, forms of action and organisational structures tailored to them, it is appropriate to retain individual programmes within the framework of the Lifelong Learning Programme targeted at each of these four sectors, while maximising the coherence and common ground between them. 
(23) In its Communication "Building our common Future: Policy challenges and Budgetary means of the Enlarged Union 2007-2013", the Commission set out a sequence of quantified targets to be achieved by the new generation of Community education and training programmes, which require a significant increase in mobility and partnership actions. 
(24) Given the demonstrated beneficial impacts of transnational mobility on individuals and on education and training systems, the high volume of unfulfilled demand for mobility in all sectors, and its importance in the context of the Lisbon target, it is necessary to increase substantially the volume of support for transnational mobility in the four sectoral sub-programmes. 
(25) In order to cover more adequately the real additional costs borne by students studying abroad, the standard student mobility grant should be maintained at an average of EUR 200 per month in real terms for the duration of the programme. 
(26) More provision should be made for the mobility needs of individual school pupils at secondary level and of individual adult learners, hitherto not covered by Community programmes, by introducing a new type of mobility action into the Comenius and Grundtvig programmes. The opportunities offered by individual teacher mobility for the development of long-term cooperation between schools in neighbouring regions should also be exploited more fully. 
(27) Small and medium-sized enterprises play an important role in the European economy. Hitherto, however, participation by such enterprises in the Leonardo da Vinci programme has been limited. Steps should be taken to improve the attractiveness of Community action to such enterprises, in particular by ensuring that more mobility opportunities are available for apprentices. Suitable arrangements, similar to those that exist under the Erasmus programme, should be made for the recognition of the outcomes of such mobility. 
(28) Given the particular educational challenges facing the children of occupational travellers and mobile workers in Europe, full use should be made of the opportunities available under the Comenius programme to support transnational activities targeted at their needs. 
(29) Increased mobility throughout Europe should be accompanied by constantly higher standards. 
(30) In order to respond to the increased need to support activities at European level designed to achieve these policy objectives, to provide a means of supporting trans-sectoral activity in the fields of languages and ICT, and to strengthen the dissemination and exploitation of results of the programme, it is appropriate to complement the four sectoral sub-programmes with a transversal programme. 
(31) In order to respond to the increasing need for knowledge and dialogue on the European integration process and its development, it is important to stimulate excellence in teaching, research and reflection in this field by supporting higher education institutions specialising in the study of the European integration process, European associations in the fields of education and training and the Jean Monnet Action. 
(32) It is necessary to provide sufficient flexibility in the formulation of this Decision to allow for appropriate adjustments in the actions of the Lifelong Learning Programme to respond to changing needs during the period from 2007 to 2013, and to avoid the inappropriately detailed provisions of previous phases of Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes. 
(33) In all its activities, the Community is to aim to eliminate inequalities, and promote equality, between men and women, as provided for in Article 3(2) of the Treaty. 
(34) Further to Article 151 of the Treaty, the Community is to take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of the Treaty, in particular in order to respect and to promote the diversity of its cultures. Particular attention should be paid to the synergy between culture, education and training. Intercultural dialogue should also be encouraged. 
(35) There is a need to promote active citizenship and respect for human rights and democracy, and to step up the fight against exclusion in all its forms, including racism and xenophobia. 
(36) There is a need to widen access for those from disadvantaged groups and to address actively the special learning needs of those with disabilities, in the implementation of all parts of the programme, including through the use of higher grants to reflect the additional costs of disabled participants, and the provision of support for the learning and use of sign languages and Braille. 
(37) Note should be taken of the achievements of the European Year of Education through Sport (2004) and of the potential educational benefits of cooperation between educational institutions and sports organisations that the Year highlighted. 
(38) The candidate countries for accession to the European Union and the EFTA countries which are members of the EEA may participate in Community programmes in accordance with agreements to be signed between the Community and these countries. 
(39) The Thessaloniki European Council of 19 and 20 June 2003 approved the Council conclusions of 16 June 2003 on the Western Balkans, including the Annex thereto "The Thessaloniki Agenda for the Western Balkans: moving towards European integration", which provides that Community programmes should be opened to the Stabilisation and Association Process countries on the basis of framework agreements to be signed between the Community and those countries. 
(40) The Community and the Swiss Confederation have declared their intention of undertaking negotiations to conclude agreements in areas of common interest such as Community education, training and youth programmes. 
(41) The Lifelong Learning Programme should be regularly monitored and evaluated in cooperation between the Commission and the Member States in order to allow for readjustments, particularly with respect to the priorities for implementing the measures. The evaluation should include an external evaluation to be conducted by independent, impartial bodies. 
(42) In its Resolution of 28 February 2002 on the implementation of the Socrates programme [12] the European Parliament drew attention to the disproportionately onerous administrative procedures for grant applicants under the second phase of the programme. 
(43) Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities [13] and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC,Euratom) No 1605/2002 [14], which safeguard the Community's financial interests, have to be applied taking into account the principles of simplicity and consistency in the choice of budgetary instruments, a limitation on the number of cases where the Commission retains direct responsibility for their implementation and management, and the required proportionality between the amount of resources and the administrative burden related to their use. 
(44) Radical administrative simplification of application procedures is essential for successful implementation of the programme. Administrative and accounting requirements should be proportional to the size of the grant. 
(45) Appropriate measures should also be taken to prevent irregularities and fraud and the necessary steps should be taken to recover funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used. 
(46) It is appropriate to ensure a correct closure of the Lifelong Learning Programme, in particular regarding the continuation of multi-annual arrangements for its management, such as the financing of technical and administrative assistance. As from 1 January 2014, the technical and administrative assistance should ensure, if necessary, the management of actions not finalised by the end of 2013, including monitoring and audit actions. 
(47) Since the objective of this Decision, namely the contribution of European cooperation to quality education and training, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the need for multilateral partnerships, transnational mobility and Community-wide exchanges of information, and can therefore, by reason of the nature of the actions and measures necessary, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. 
(48) This Decision lays down for the entire duration of the programme, a financial envelope constituting the prime reference within the meaning of point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management [15], for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure. 
(49) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [16],

In particular, the Commission shall ensure that the financial rules and the application and reporting requirements for individual mobility and for partnerships remain user-friendly and sufficiently simple not to restrict access for less advantaged individuals and the institutions or organisations that work with them. 
In particular, the Commission shall provide the national agencies with criteria which they shall follow in regard to selection and award procedures, as well as contract and payment/audit arrangements, for the funds they manage. These criteria shall take into account the size of the grants made and, where grants are of less than EUR 25000, they shall provide for simplified systems at all stages involving applicants or beneficiaries. They shall enable the national agencies to determine and limit the details required from applicants for grants and to issue contracts following the award of grants on a simplified basis which includes only the following elements:

- the maximum amount of funding awarded, 
- a summary description of the action involved, 
- reporting and audit access requirements. 
Also they shall enable the national agencies to provide that co-financing provided by beneficiaries may take the form of contributions in kind. These shall be verifiable as to fact, but need not be the subject of financial evaluation.

In accordance with the principle of proportionality, certification and reporting requirements will be kept to an appropriate minimum necessary level. 
13. Technical assistance 
The financial envelope of the Lifelong Learning Programme may also cover expenditure related to preparatory actions, monitoring, control, audit and evaluation directly necessary for the implementation of the Programme and for the achievement of its objectives. These may in particular include studies, meetings, information activities, publications, expenditure on informatics networks for the exchange of information and any other expenditure on technical and administrative assistance to which the Commission may need to have recourse for the implementation of the Programme. 
14. Anti-fraud provisions 
Commission decisions taken under Article 9, the contracts and agreements resulting from them, as well as agreements with participating third countries, shall provide in particular for supervision and financial control by the Commission (or any representative authorised by it), including by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), and for audits by the Court of Auditors, if necessary on-the-spot. Such controls may be carried out with the national agencies as well, where necessary, as with recipients of grants. 
The beneficiary of an operating grant shall keep available for the Commission all the supporting documents, including the audited financial statement, regarding expenditure incurred during the grant year, for a period of five years following the last payment. The beneficiary of a grant shall ensure that, where applicable, supporting documents in the possession of partners or members be made available to the Commission. 
The Commission may have an audit of the use made of the grant carried out either directly by its own staff or by any other qualified outside body of its choice. Such audits may be carried out throughout the lifetime of the agreement and for a period of five years from the date of payment of the balance. Where appropriate, the audit findings may lead to recovery decisions by the Commission. 
Commission staff and outside personnel authorised by the Commission shall have appropriate right of access, in particular to the beneficiary's offices and to all the information, including information in electronic format, needed in order to conduct such audits. 
The Court of Auditors and OLAF shall enjoy the same rights, especially of access, as the Commission. 
In addition, the Commission may carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections under the Lifelong Learning Programme in accordance with Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities [1]. 
For the Community actions financed under this decision, the notion of irregularity referred to in Article 1, paragraph 2 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests [2] shall mean any infringement of a provision of Community law or any breach of a contractual obligation resulting from an act or omission by an economic operator, which has, or would have, the effect of prejudicing the general budget of the European Communities or allocations managed by them, by an unjustified item of expenditure.

STATEMENT OF THE COUNCIL'S REASONS 
I. INTRODUCTION 
1. On 15 July 2004 the Commission submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council a proposal for a decision, based on Articles 149(4) and 150(4) of the EC Treaty, establishing an integrated action programme in the field of lifelong learning for the period 2007-2013. 
2. The Economic and Social Committee delivered its opinion on 10 February 2005. [1] 
3. The Committee of the Regions delivered its opinion on 23 February 2005. [2] 
4. The European Parliament delivered its opinion at first reading on 25 October 2005. [3] 
5. On 24 July 2006, the Council adopted its common position in accordance with Article 251 (2) of the EC Treaty. 
II. OBJECTIVE 
This proposal for a new fully integrated EU programme in the field of education and training is to replace the existing Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, e-learning and related programmes, which are due to expire at the end of 2006. The Lifelong Learning Programme comprises four sub-programmes (Comenius for school education, Erasmus for higher education, Leonardo da Vinci for vocational training and Grundtvig for adult education), a series of transversal measures and the Jean Monnet programme focusing on European integration. The aim of the Programme is both to contribute through lifelong learning to the development of the Community as an advanced knowledge society in the context of the strategic Lisbon goals, and to bring European added value directly to individual citizens by fostering interaction, cooperation and mobility between education and training systems within the Community. 
III. ANALYSIS OF THE COMMON POSITION 
1. General comments 
The Council's common position remains broadly consistent with the Commission's original proposal, although a significant number of EP amendments were incorporated into the text and a number of technical adjustments — chiefly concerning implementation procedures — were made following the downward revision of the overall financial envelope for the Programme. The revised allocation of EUR 6200 million (at 2004 prices — i.e. EUR 6970 million at current prices) was agreed by the three institutions in the context of the Interinstitutional Agreement on the Financial Framework for 2007-2013. 
2. New elements contained in the common position as compared to the Commission proposal 
Despite a smaller overall financial allocation than anticipated, the overall objectives of the Programme remain intact and the principle of quantified targets for each of the sub-programmes has been maintained. There is also scope within the Programme to expand the number and type of projects covered in the event of any future increase in funding. 
The Council has also sought to strike the right balance between projects under the various sub-programmes, slightly increasing the emphasis placed on adult education in response to current employment and demographic trends. As a result, the minimum allocation for the Grundtvig Programme rises to 4 %. 
The Council has endeavoured to simplify administrative procedures for project applicants. In addition, it has re-introduced a management committee procedure for individual selection decisions on projects, networks and accompanying measures where the Community contribution exceeds EUR 1 million, and for all projects and networks within the "Policy Development" key activity of the Transversal programme. 
For greater legibility and in order to give the objectives a clearer focus, the Council has restructured and simplified many parts of the original proposal, one example being the amalgamation of the implementation articles for each of the sub-programmes into a single article (9). A number of drafting improvements have also been made for greater clarity. In addition, the Council has given detailed consideration to the definitions contained in Article 2, has incorporated specific references to the need for quality, high performance and innovation and has endeavoured to ensure effective monitoring and the availability of comparable data as a means of underpinning lifelong learning policy development in general. 
Finally, in keeping with the EP's opinion, the Council has sought to increase mobility, in particular for vocational trainees, to promote inter-regional cooperation through cross-border mobility and partnerships and to enhance the exchange of best practices. It has also acceded to the EP's request to include two more designated bodies — the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education in Middelfart (Denmark), and the International Centre for European Training in Nice (France). 
3. European Parliament amendments 
3.1. Amendments accepted in full, in part or in principle 
The Council has been able to accept a considerable number of the European Parliament's amendments in full or in part. 
Amendments 1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30, 40, 42, 47, 49, 51, 59, 60, 62, 64, 67 and 68 have been included in full. 
Amendments 5, 8, 9, 12, 19, 20, 24, 26, 31, 32, 36, 39, 48, 50, 58, 69 and 71 have been accepted in part or reworded. 
3.2. Amendments not incorporated 
In the light of the Interinstitutional Agreement on the Financial Framework referred to in section 1 above, the Council rejected amendment 43 which concerns the overall budget as well as amendments 13, 45, 56 and 66 containing quantative targets which had to be revised. Although the Council was also unable to accept the Parliament's proposal in amendment 70 on the indicative budget breakdown for the four main sub-programmes, as set out in Annex B.11, its final position remained close to that of the EP. 
A number of amendments (4, 7, 16, 28, 41) were rejected on the grounds that their content was covered by recitals or other provisions of the legislative text, while references to disparities between the various EU education systems (amendment 2) or to the convergence of those systems (amendments 20 and 44) were rejected on the grounds of subsidiarity. Amendment 21 on the interaction between enterprises, higher education establishments and scientists was seen as referring more to a means of achieving an objective rather than an objective in itself, while amendment 33 was considered inappropriate in view of the Decision's legal basis. 
The Council felt that amendment 34 was unacceptable because it was unclear which persons and bodies could be considered as responsible for lifelong learning policies "at European level". Amendments 35, 37, 52, 53, 54 and 55 were not retained since they were regarded as either too detailed or too specific for a legislative text, while on the procedural side amendment 65 was felt to be self-evident and was therefore also rejected. 
Amendment 46 on the learning of second or additional foreign languages was rejected on the grounds that it was too far-reaching for some Member States, while amendment 57 concerning the accreditation of prior experience was considered to be inappropriate for the Grundtvig programme. 
Finally, since the Council could only agree to the inclusion of two of the four additional designated bodies requested by the EP, the remaining two referred to in amendments 61 and 63 were rejected. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
The Council considers that its common position constitutes a balanced text, providing a good basis for launching this instrument and thereby promoting the development of lifelong learning policies throughout Europe. It particularly welcomes this integrated approach which, by bringing together in a single instrument a range of programmes and actions in the education and training fields — from primary to adult education, will ensure greater coherence between the constituent parts and enable a more flexible range of actions to be supported more efficiently. It also commends the efforts to simplify administrative procedures and make the programme more user-friendly. Against this background, Council looks forward to reaching an agreement with Parliament in the near future with a view to the early adoption of the Decision.
