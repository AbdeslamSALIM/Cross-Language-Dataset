amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2018/93 on the submission of catch and activity statistics by Member States fishing in the North-West Atlantic 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2018/93 of 30 June 1993 on the submission of catch and activity statistics by Member States fishing in the North-West Atlantic(1), and in particular Article 2(4) and Article 4 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The Ninth Meeting of the Conference of Parties of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 1994 requested the monitoring of catch and trade data of elasmobranch fish species (sharks, skates and rays) be undertaken by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and by regional fishery agencies. 
(2) The Scientific Council of the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) has identified the elasmobranch fishes appearing in the catches in the North-West Atlantic and has requested the NAFO Contracting Parties to report these catches on the Statlant 21A and 21B questionnaires managed by the FAO. 
(3) Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2018/93, the equivalent of the abovementioned Statlant 21a and 21B questionnaires, needs to be amended in order to meet the European Community's obligation as a Contracting Party to the NAFO Convention. 
(4) The NAFO Scientific Council has adopted certain changes to the description of subarea and divisions of the North-West Atlantic, and changes and additions to the definitions and coding to be used in the submission of catch data. 
(5) Article 4(2) to Regulation (EEC) No 2018/93 provides that Member States, with the prior approval of the Commission, may submit data in a different form or on a different medium from that laid down in Annex V to the Regulation. 
(6) Several Member States have requested submission of data in a different form or through a different medium from that specified in Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 2018/93 (the equivalent of the abovementioned Statlant questionnaires). 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics set up by Council Decision 72/279/EEC(2), 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Annexes I, III and IV to Regulation (EEC) No 2018/93 shall be replaced by Annexes I, II and III to this Regulation. 
Article 2 
Member States may submit data following that in the format detailed in Annex IV to this Regulation.

ANNEX I 
LIST OF SPECIES WHICH HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE COMMERCIAL CATCH STATISTICS FOR THE NORTH-WEST ATLANTIC 
Member States must report the nominal catches of those species marked with an asterisk (*). The reporting of nominal catches of the remaining species is optional as concerns the identification of the individual species. However, where data for individual species are not submitted the data shall be included in aggregate categories. Member States may submit data for species not in the list provided that the species are clearly identified.
