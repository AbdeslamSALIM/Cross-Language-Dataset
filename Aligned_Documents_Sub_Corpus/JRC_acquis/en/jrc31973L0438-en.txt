Whereas the maximum content of hard seed should be increased in the case of the species Trifolium repens ; whereas, moreover, the species Phleum Bertolinii should be brought within the field of application of the Directive concerned; 
Whereas it is appropriate that to a certain extent the minimum conditions for cereal species should be reinforced ; whereas on the other hand less strict requirements for the official inspection of autogamous species should, be authorized for a transitional period; 
Whereas experience of supplying flax seed makes it necessary to admit for four further years the category %quot%Certified seed, third generation%quot%;

Whereas certain of the abovementioned Directives provide that from 1 July 1973 the equivalent of seed and plants harvested in other countries, particularly in third countries, can no longer be established nationally by Member States ; whereas, however, since it has not been possible to carry out the Community examination in all cases, the abovementioned period should be extended in order to avoid disturbing current commercial relations;
