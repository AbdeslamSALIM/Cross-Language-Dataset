Having regard to Council Decision 91/666/EEC of 11 December 1991 establishing Community reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines (3), and, in particular, Articles 5 and 7 thereof, 
Whereas, in conformity with Decision 91/666/EEC, the purchase of antigens is a part of the Community action to establish Community reserves of foot and mouth disease vaccines; 
Whereas the Commission has issued a call for tenders for the supply of antigens; 
Whereas the Commission has examined the submitted tenders taking into account the following factors: 
- the technical requirements of Annex II to Decision 91/666/EEC and other criteria mentioned in Article 5 of that Decision, 
- that some establishments are unable to supply the full number of doses of some antigens, 
- the need for the producing establishment to be in full conformity with the guidelines for good manufacturing practices (GMP); 
Whereas the Commission has selected Rhône-Mérieux to supply five million doses of each of subtypes A5, A22, O1 European strain and O1 Middle East strain as a first step; whereas the establishments which will supply the other strains in Annex I to Decision 91/666/EEC will be decided after a further call for tenders; 
Whereas financial provisions should be made to allow the Commission to purchase these strains from Rhône-Mérieux; 
Whereas, under the provisions of Article 7 of Decision 91/666/EEC, it is necessary to lay down the rules for the distribution of antigen reserves between the antigen banks, nominated in Article 1 of the said Decision; 
Whereas it is appropriate that each strain should be divided equally between two banks; whereas the strains stored in each bank should be related geographically to the most likely area of risk; 
Whereas in accordance with Article 40 of Council Decision 90/424/EEC, checks provided for in Articles 8 and 9 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 concerning the financing of the common agricultural policy (4) shall apply; whereas, moreover, certain particular provisions should be made;
