THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 260/2003(2), and in particular Article 23 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 260/2003, amending Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, introduced new Community rules for eradication following the confirmation of scrapie in a small ruminant holding, based on the opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) of 4 and 5 April 2002 on safe sourcing of small ruminant materials. In the interests of consistency with such rules for eradication, the rules for intra-Community trade in breeding sheep were also amended to remove scrapie-related restrictions from trade in sheep of the ARR/ARR prion protein genotype. 
(2) Rules for the import of live ovine and caprine animals should be amended to reflect rules for intra-Community trade. 
(3) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
