Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 5 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 5(5) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 824/2000(3) provides for a tolerance of 5 % between the quantity determined by weighing and the quantity estimated in accordance with the volumetric method in the case of take-over in the store in which the cereals are being held at the time of the offer. Where the tolerance is exceeded, the cereals are weighed forthwith. The costs of weighing are borne by the storekeeper, where the weight determined is less than that recorded, or by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, where it is more. 
(2) Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 147/91 defining and fixing the tolerances for quantity losses of agricultural products in public intervention storage(4), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 652/92(5), lays down for cereals a tolerance limit for quantity losses resulting from normal storage operations and the differences in results between two weighing operations. This tolerance must also be taken into account in determining who should bear the costs of the weighing operation provided for in Article 5(5)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 824/2000. 
(3) Regulation (EC) No 824/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.
