COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2046/85 
of 24 July 1985 
amending Regulation (EEC) No 1985/74 laying down detailed rules of application for the fixing of reference prices and free-at-frontier prices for carp 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 of 29 December 1981 on the common organization of the market in fishery products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3655/84 (2), and in particular Article 22 (5) thereof, 
Whereas Article 22 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 provides that reference prices for carp may be fixed before the beginning of each marketing year; whereas these prices may be fixed at different levels for periods to be specified within each marketing year according to seasonal fluctuations in prices; 
Whereas Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1985/74 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1701/78 (4), provides that one of the periods for which a reference price should be fixed shall be that running from 1 December to 31 July of the following year; 
Whereas experience has indicated the need to subdivide this period into two parts; whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1985/74 should therefore be amended; 
Whereas the Management Committee for Fishery Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1985/74 is replaced by the following: 
'A reference price shall be fixed for carp for the periods running: 
- from 1 August to 30 November, 
- from 1 December to 31 December, 
- from 1 January to 31 July.' 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 August 1985. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. 
Done at Brussels, 24 July 1985.
