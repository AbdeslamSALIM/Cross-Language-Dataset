Council Regulation (EC) No&amp;nbsp;374/2005 of 28 February 2005 amending Regulation (EC) No&amp;nbsp;2007/2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union&amp;rsquo;s stabilisation and association process 
Council Regulation (EC) No 374/2005 
of 28 February 2005 
amending Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union√¢&#x20AC;&#x2122;s stabilisation and association process 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) Under Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 [1], the Community has extended duty-free access to imports from the countries concerned of most agricultural goods, including sugar. 
(2) In the case of sugar, the duty-free access for unlimited quantities has created an incentive for western Balkan production at levels that are unsustainable in view of foreseeable developments. 
(3) The modification of the import regime for each of the western Balkan countries, while allowing the respect of present trade concessions will prepare their sector for the adjustments needed to perform within a realistic and economically sustainable environment. 
(4) Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 should be amended to clarify that preferential Community wine imports from the western Balkans benefit only from tariff quotas, rather than unlimited duty-free access, under the autonomous measures,
