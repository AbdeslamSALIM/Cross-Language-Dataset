Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 of 15 June 1992 concerning specific measures for the Azores and Madeira relating to certain agricultural products (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3290/94, and in particular Article 10 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals (4), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden and by Regulation (EC) No 3290/94, and in particular Article 10 (4) thereof, 
Whereas the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture calls for substantial changes to the import arrangements; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 388/92 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3101/94 (6), together with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1727/92 (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2426/94 (8), should therefore be adapted accordingly;
