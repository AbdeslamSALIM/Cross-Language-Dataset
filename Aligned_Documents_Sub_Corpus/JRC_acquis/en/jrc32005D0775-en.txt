Commission Decision 
of 4 November 2005 
amending Decision 2002/499/EC authorising derogations from certain provisions of Council Directive 2000/29/EC in respect of naturally or artificially dwarfed plants of Chamaecyparis Spach, Juniperus L. and Pinus L., originating in the Republic of Korea 
(notified under document number C(2005) 4235) 
(2005/775/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community [1], and in particular Article 15(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Under Directive 2000/29/EC, plants of Chamaecyparis Spach, Juniperus L. and Pinus L., other than fruits and seeds, originating in non-European countries, must not in principle be introduced into the Community. However, Directive 2000/29/EC permits derogations from this rule, provided that it is established that there is no risk of introduction of harmful organisms. 
(2) Commission Decision 2002/499/EC [2], provides for a derogation for the importation of plants of Chamaecyparis Spach, Juniperus L. and Pinus L., other than fruits and seeds, originating in the Republic of Korea, subject to specific conditions. 
(3) The United Kingdom has asked for an extension of that derogation. 
(4) The situation justifying that derogation remains unchanged and the derogation should therefore continue to apply. 
(5) Decision 2002/499/EC should, therefore, be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
