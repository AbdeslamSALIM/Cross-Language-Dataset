Directive 96/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 on the protection of occupants of motor vehicles in the event of a frontal impact and amending Directive 70/156/EEC 
DIRECTIVE 96/79/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 16 December 1996 on the protection of occupants of motor vehicles in the event of a frontal impact and amending Directive 70/156/EEC 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (1), and in particular Article 13 (4) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (4), 
Whereas the total harmonization of technical requirements for motor vehicles is necessary in order fully to achieve the internal market; 
Whereas, in order to reduce the number of road accident casualties in Europe, it is necessary to introduce legislative measures for improving the protection of occupants of motor vehicles in the event of a frontal impact as much as possible; whereas this Directive introduces frontal impact test requirements, including biomechanical criteria, to ensure that a high level of protection in the event of a frontal impact is provided; 
Whereas the aim of this Directive is to introduce requirements based on the results of research conducted by the European Experimental Vehicles Committee allowing the establishment of test criteria which are more representative of actual road accidents; 
Whereas lead times are required by vehicle manufacturers for the implementation of acceptable test criteria; 
Whereas, to avoid duplication of standards, it is necessary to exempt vehicles which comply with the requirements of this Directive from the need to comply with now superseded requirements in another Directive in respect of the behaviour of the steering wheel and column in an impact; 
Whereas this Directive will be one of the separate directives which must be complied with in order to ensure the conformity of vehicles with the requirements of the EC type-approval procedure established by Directive 70/156/EEC; whereas, therefore, the provisions of Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive; 
Whereas the procedure for determining the seating reference point in motor vehicles is given in Annex III to Council Directive 77/649/EEC of 27 September 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the field of vision of motor vehicle drivers (5); whereas it is therefore unnecessary to repeat it in this Directive; whereas reference should be made in this Directive to Council Directive 74/297/EEC of 4 June 1974 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the interior fittings of motor vehicles (the behaviour of the steering mechanism in the event of an impact) (6); whereas reference is made to the United States of America Code of Federal Regulations (7),

Appendix 1 
TEST PROCEDURE 
1. INSTALLATION AND PREPARATION OF THE VEHICLE 
1.1. Testing ground 
The test area must be large enough to accommodate the run-up track, barrier and technical installations necessary for the test. The last part of the track, for at least 5 m before the barrier, must be horizontal, flat and smooth. 
1.2. Barrier 
The front face of the barrier consists of a deformable structure as defined in Appendix 6 of this Annex. The front face of the deformable structure is perpendicular Â± 1Â° to the direction of travel of the test vehicle. The barrier is secured to a mass of not less than 7 Ã— 104 kg, the front face of which is vertical Â± 1Â°. This mass is anchored in the ground or placed on the ground with, if necessary, additional arresting devices to restrict its movement. 
1.3. Orientation of the barrier 
The orientation of the barrier is such that the first contact of the vehicle with the barrier is on the steering-column side. Where there is a choice between carrying out the test with a right-hand or left-hand drive vehicle, the test must be carried out with the less favourable hand of drive as determined by the technical service responsible for the tests. 
1.3.1. Alignment of the vehicle to the barrier 
The vehicle must overlap the barrier face by 40 % Â± 20 mm. 
1.4. State of vehicle 
1.4.1. General specification 
The test vehicle must be representative of the series production, include all the equipment normally fitted and be in normal running order. Some components may be replaced by equivalent masses where this substitution clearly has no noticeable effect on the results measured under paragraph 6. 
1.4.2. Mass of the vehicle 
1.4.2.1. For the test, the mass of the vehicle submitted must be the unladen kerb mass. 
1.4.2.2. The fuel tank must be filled with water up to 90 % of the mass of a full load of fuel as specified by the manufacturer with a Â± 1 % tolerance. 
1.4.2.3. All the other systems (brakes, cooling, etc.) may be empty; in this case the mass of the liquids must be offset. 
1.4.2.4. If the mass of the measuring apparatus on board the vehicle exceeds the 25 kg allowed, it may be offset by reductions which have no noticeable effect on the results measured under paragraph 6 below. 
1.4.2.5. The mass of the measuring apparatus must not change each axle reference load by more than 5 %, each variation not exceeding 20 kg. 
1.4.2.6. The mass of the vehicle resulting from the provisions of paragraph 1.4.2.1 above must be indicated in the report. 
1.4.3. Passenger compartment adjustments 
1.4.3.1. Position of steering wheel 
The steering wheel, if adjustable, must be placed in the normal position indicated by the manufacturer or, failing that, midway between the limits of its range(s) of adjustment. At the end of propelled travel, the steering wheel must be left free, with its spokes in the position which according to the manufacturer corresponds to straight-ahead travel of the vehicle. 
1.4.3.2. Glazing 
The movable glazing of the vehicle must be in the closed position. For test measurement purposes and in agreement with the manufacturer, it may be lowered, provided that the position of the operating handle corresponds to the closed position. 
1.4.3.3. Gear-change lever 
The gear-change lever must be in the neutral position. 
1.4.3.4. Pedals 
The pedals must be in their normal position of rest. If adjustable, they must be set in their mid position unless another position is specified by the manufacturer. 
1.4.3.5. Doors 
The doors must be closed, but not locked. 
1.4.3.6. Opening roof 
If an opening or removable roof is fitted, it must be in place and in the closed position. For test measurement purposes and in agreement with the manufacturer, it may be open. 
1.4.3.7. Sun-visor 
The sun-visors must be in the stowed position. 
1.4.3.8. Rear-view mirror 
The interior rear-view mirror must be in the normal position of use. 
1.4.3.9. Arm-rests 
Arm-rests at the front and rear, if movable, must be in the lowered position, unless this is prevented by the position of the dummies in the vehicles. 
1.4.3.10. Head restraints 
Head restraints adjustable for height must be in their uppermost position.

Appendix 2 
DETERMINATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 
1. HEAD PERFORMANCE CRITERION (HPC) 
1.1. This criterion is considered to be satisfied when, during the test, there is no contact between the head and any vehicle component. 
1.2. If that is not the case, a calculation of the value of HPC is made, on the basis of the acceleration (a), measured according to section 5.2.1 of Appendix 1 to this Annex, by the following expression: 
HPC = (t2-t1) [ %gt%NUM%gt%1 %gt%DEN%gt%t2-t1 %amp%int; t2 t1 adt]2,5 
in which: 
1.2.1. the term 'a` is the resultant acceleration measured according to paragraph 5.2.1 of Appendix 1 to this Annex and is measured in units of gravity, g (1 g = 9,81 m/sÂ²); 
1.2.2. if the beginning of the head contact can be determined satisfactorily, t1 and t2 are the two time instants, expressed in seconds, defining an interval between the beginning of the head contact and the end of the recording for which the value of HPC is maximum; 
1.2.3. if the beginning of the head contact cannot be determined, t1 and t2 are the two time instants, expressed in seconds, defining a time interval between the beginning and the end of the recording for which the value of HPC is maximum. 
1.2.4. Values of HPC for which the time interval (t1 - t2) is greater than 36 ms are ignored for the purposes of calculating the maximum value. 
1.3. The value of the resultant head acceleration during forward impact which is exceeded for 3 ms cumulatively is calculated from the resultant head acceleration measured according to paragraph 5.2.1 of Appendix 1 to this Annex. 
2. NECK INJURY CRITERIA (NIC) 
2.1. These criteria are determined by the compressive axial force, the axial tensile force and the fore/aft shear forces at the head/neck interface, expressed in kN and measured according to paragraph 5.2.2 of Appendix 1 to this Annex and by the duration of these forces expressed in ms. 
2.2. The neck bending moment criterion is determined by the bending moment, expressed in Nm, about a lateral axis at the head/neck interface and measured according to paragraph 5.2.2 of Appendix 1 to this Annex. 
2.3. The neck flexion bending moment, expressed in Nm, must be recorded. 
3. THORAX COMPRESSION CRITERION (ThCC) AND VISCOUS CRITERION (V*C) 
3.1. The thorax compression criterion is determined by the absolute value of the thorax deformation, expressed in mm and measured according to paragraph 5.2.3 of Appendix 1 to this Annex. 
3.2. The viscous criterion (V*C) is calculated as the instantaneous product of the compression and the rate of deflection of the sternum, measured according to paragraph 6 and also paragraph 5.2.3 of Appendix 1 to this Annex. 
4. FEMUR FORCE CRITERION (FFC) 
4.1. This criterion is determined by the compression load expressed in kN, transmitted axially on each femur of the dummy and measured according to paragraph 5.2.4 of Appendix 1 to this Annex and by the duration of the compressive load expressed in ms. 
5. TIBIA COMPRESSIVE FORCE CRITERION (TCFC) AND TIBIA INDEX (TI) 
5.1. The tibia compressive force criterion is determined by the compressive load (Fz) expressed in kN, transmitted axially on each tibia of the dummy and measured according to paragraph 5.2.4 of Appendix 1 to Annex II. 
5.2. The tibia index is calculated on the basis of the bending moments (MX and MY) measured according to paragraph 5.1 by the following expression: 
TI= | %gt%NUM%gt%MR/ %gt%DEN%gt%(MC)R| + | %gt%NUM%gt%FZ/ %gt%DEN%gt%(FC)Z | 
where: MX= bending moment about the x axis 
MY = bending moment about the y axis 
(MC)R = critical bending moment and shall be taken to be 225 Nm 
FZ = compressive axial force in the z direction 
(FC)Z = critical compressive force in the z direction and shall be taken to be 35,9 kN 
MR = %amp%radic;(MX)Â² + (MY)Â² 
The tibia index is calculated for the top and the bottom of each tibia; however, Fz may be measured at either location. The value obtained is used for the top and bottom TI calculations. Moments MX and MY are both measured separately at both locations. 
6. PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATING THE VISCOUS CRITERION (V*C) FOR HYBRID III DUMMY 
6.1. The viscous criterion is calculated as the instantaneous product of the compression and the rate of deflection of the sternum. Both are derived from the measurement of sternum deflection. 
6.2. The sternum deflection response is filtered once at CFC 180. The compression at time t is calculated from this filtered signal as: 
C(t) = %gt%NUM%gt%D(t) %gt%DEN%gt%0,229 
The sternum deflection velocity at time t is calculated from the filtered deflection as: 
V(t) = %gt%NUM%gt%8Ã—(D(t+1) - D(t-1)) - (D(t+2) - D(t-2)) %gt%DEN%gt%12Ã¤t 
where D(2) is the deflection at time t in metres and Ã¤t is the time interval in seconds between the measurements of deflection. The maximum value of Ã¤t is 1,25 Ã— 10-4 seconds. This calculation procedure is shown diagrammatically below.

3. ADJUSTMENT OF RESTRAINT SYSTEM 
With the test dummy at its designated seating position as specified by the appropriate requirements of paragraphs 2.1 to 2.6, place the belt around the test dummy and fasten the latch. Remove all slack from the lap belt. Pull the upper torso webbing out of the retractor and allow it to retract; repeat this operation four times. Apply a tension load of between 9 and 18 N to the lap belt. If the belt system is equipped with a tension-relieving device, introduce the maximum amount of slack into the upper torso belt that is recommended by the manufacturer for normal use in the owner's manual for the vehicle. If the belt system is not equipped with a tension-relieving device, allow the excess webbing in the shoulder belt to be retracted by the retracting force of the retractor. 
(1) Until an international standard has been adopted for this item, gauges conforming to GM drawing 78051-532, referencing part 572, must be used.

Appendix 5 
TECHNIQUE OF MEASUREMENT IN MEASUREMENT TESTS: INSTRUMENTATION 
1. DEFINITIONS 
1.1. Data channel 
A data channel comprises all the instrumentation from a transducer (or multiple transducers whose outputs are combined in some specified way) up to and including any analysis procedures that may alter the frequency content or the amplitude content of data. 
1.2. Transducer 
The first device in a data channel used to convert a physical quantity to be measured into a second quantity (such as an electrical voltage) which can be processed by the remainder of the channel. 
1.3. Channel amplitude class: CAC 
The designation for a data channel that meets certain amplitude characteristics as specified in this Appendix. The CAC number is numerically equal to the upper limit of the measurement range. 
1.4. Characteristic frequencies FH, FL, FN 
These frequencies are defined in figure 1. 
1.5. Channel frequency class: CFC 
The channel frequency class is designated by a number indicating that the channel frequency response lies within the limits specified in Figure 1. This number and the value of the frequency FH in Hz are numerically equal. 
1.6. Sensitivity coefficient 
The slope of the straight line representing the best fit to the calibration values determined by the method of least square within the channel amplitude class. 
1.7. Calibration factor of a data channel 
The mean value of the sensitivity coefficients evaluated over frequencies which are evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale between FL and 0,4 FH. 
1.8. Linearity error 
The ratio, in per cent, of the maximum difference between the calibration value and the corresponding value read on the straight line defined in 1.6 at the upper limit of the channel amplitude class. 
1.9. Cross sensitivity 
The ratio of the output signal to the input signal, when an excitation is applied to the transducer perpendicular to the measurement axis. It is expressed as a percentage of the sensitivity along the measurement axis. 
1.10. Phase delay time 
The phase delay time of a data channel is equal to the phase delay (in radians) of a sinusoidal signal, divided by the angular frequency of that signal (in radians/s). 
1.11. Environment 
The aggregate, at a given moment, of all external conditions and influences to which the data channel is subjected. 
2. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS 
2.1. Linearity error 
The absolute value of the linearity error of a data channel at any frequency in the CFC, must be equal to or less than 2,5 % of the value of the CAC, over the whole measurement range. 
2.2. Amplitude against frequency 
The frequency response of a data channel must lie within the limiting curves given in Figure 1. The zero dB line is determined by the calibration factor. 
2.3. Phase delay time 
The phase delay time between the input and the output signals of a data channel must be determined and must not vary by more than 0,1 FH s between 0,03 FH and FH. 
2.4. Time base 
2.4.1. A time base must be recorded and must at least give 10 ms with an accuracy of 1 %. 
2.4.2. Relative time delay 
The relative time delay between the signal of two or more data channels, regardless of their frequency class, must not exceed 1 ms excluding delay caused by phase shift. 
Two or more data channels of which the signals are combined must have the same frequency class and must not have relative time delay greater than 0,1 FHs. 
This requirement applies to analogue signals as well as to synchronization pulses and digital signals. 
2.5. Transducer cross sensitivity 
The transducer cross sensitivity must be less than 5 % in any direction. 
2.6. Calibration 
2.6.1. General 
A data channel should be calibrated at least once a year against reference equipment traceable to known standards. The methods used to carry out a comparison with reference equipment must not introduce an error greater than 1 % of the CAC. The use of the reference equipment is limited to the frequency range for which it has been calibrated. Subsystems of a data channel may be evaluated individually and the results factored into the accuracy of the total data channel. This can be done for example by an electrical signal of known amplitude simulating the output signal of the transducer which allows a check to be made on the gain factor of the data channel, excluding the transducer. 
2.6.2. Accuracy of reference equipment for calibration 
The accuracy of the reference equipment must be certified or endorsed by an official metrology service. 
2.6.2.1. Static calibration 
2.6.2.1.1. Accelerations 
The errors must be less than Â± 1,5 % of the CAC. 
2.6.2.1.2. Forces 
The errors must be less than Â± 1 % of the CAC. 
2.6.2.1.3. Displacements 
The errors must be less than Â± 1 % of the CAC. 
2.6.2.2. Dynamic calibration 
2.6.2.2.1. Accelerations 
The error in the reference accelerations expressed as a percentage of the CAC must be less than Â± 1,5 % below 400 Hz, less than Â± 2 % between 400 Hz and 900 Hz, and less than Â± 2,5 % above 900 Hz. 
2.6.2.3. Time 
The relative error in the reference time must be less than 10-5. 
2.6.3. Sensitivity coefficient and linearity error 
The sensitivity coefficient and the linearity error must be determined by measuring the output signal of the data channel against a known input signal for various values of this signal. The calibration of the data channel must cover the whole range of the amplitude class. 
For bi-directional channels, both the positive and negative values must be used. 
If the calibration equipment cannot produce the required input owing to the excessively high values of the quantity to be measured, calibrations must be carried out within the limits of the calibration standards and these limits must be recorded in the test report. 
A total data channel must be calibrated at a frequency or at a spectrum of frequencies having a significant value between FL and 0,4 FH. 
2.6.4. Calibration of the frequency response 
The response curves of phase and amplitude against frequency are determined by measuring the output signals of the data channel in terms of phase and amplitude against a known input signal, for various values of this signal varying between FL and 10 times the CFC or 3 000 Hz, whichever is lower. 
2.7. Environmental effects 
A regular check should be made to identify any environmental influence (such as electric or magnetic flux, cable velocity, etc.). This can be done for instance by recording the output of spare channels equipped with dummy transducers. If significant output signals are obtained corrective action should be taken, for instance by replacement of cables. 
2.8. Choice and designation of the data channel 
The CAC and CFC define a data channel. 
The CAC must be 1, 2 or 5 to a power of ten. 
3. MOUNTING OF TRANSDUCERS 
Transducers should be rigidly secured so that their recordings are affected by vibration as little as possible. Any mounting having a lowest resonance frequency equal to at least 5 times the frequency FH of the data channel considered will be considered valid. Acceleration transducers in particular should be mounted in such a way that the initial angle of the real measurement axis to the corresponding axis of the reference axis system is not greater than 5Â° unless an analytical or experimental assessment of the effect of the mounting on the collected data is made. When multi-axial accelerations at a point are to be measured, each acceleration transducer axis should pass within 10 mm of that point, and the centre of seismic mass of each accelerometer should be within 30 mm of that point. 
4. RECORDING 
4.1. Analogue magnetic recorder 
Tape speed should be stable to within not more than 0,5 % of the tape speed used. The signal-to-noise ratio of the recorder should not be less than 42 dB at the maximum tape speed. The total harmonic distortion should be less than 3 % and the linearity error should be less than 1 % of the measurement range. 
4.2. Digital magnetic recorder 
Tape speed should be stable to within not more than 10 % of the tape speed used. 
4.3. Paper tape recorder 
In case of direct data recording the paper speed in mm/s should be at least one and a half times the number expressing FH in Hz. In other cases the paper speed should be such that equivalent resolution is obtained. 
5. DATA PROCESSING 
5.1. Filtering 
Filtering corresponding to the frequencies of the data channel class may be carried out during either recording or processing of data. However, before recording, analogical filtering at a higher level than CFC should be effected in order to use at least 50 % of the dynamic range of the recorder and to reduce the risk of high frequencies saturating the recorder or causing aliasing errors in the digitalizing process. 
5.2. Digitalizing 
5.2.1. The sampling frequency should be equal to at least 8 FH. In the case of analogue recording, when the recording and reading speeds are different, the sampling frequency can be divided by the speed ratio. 
5.2.2. Amplitude resolution 
The size of digital words should be at least 7 bits and a parity bit. 
6. PRESENTATION OF RESULTS 
The results should be presented on A4 size paper (210 Ã— 297 mm). Results presented as diagrams should have axes scaled with a measurement unit corresponding to a suitable multiple of the chosen unit (for example, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 mm). SI units should be used, except for vehicle velocity, where km/h may be used, and for accelerations due to impact where g, with g = 9,81 m/sÂ², may be used.

1.6. Adhesive 
The adhesive to be used throughout should be a two-part polyurethane (such as Ciba-Geigy XB5090/1 resin with XB5304 hardener, or equivalent). 
2. ALUMINIUM HONEYCOMB CERTIFICATION 
A complete testing procedure for certification of aluminium honeycomb is given in NHTSA TP-214D. The following is a summary of the procedure that should be applied to materials for the frontal impact barrier, these materials having a crush strength of 0,342 MPa and 1,711 MPa respectively. 
2.1. Sample locations 
To ensure uniformity of crush strength across the whole of the barrier face, eight samples must be taken from four locations evenly spaced across the honeycomb block. For a block to pass certification, seven of these eight samples must meet the crush strength requirements of the following sections. 
The location of the samples depends on the size of the honeycomb block. First, four samples, each measuring 300 mm Ã— 300 mm Ã— 50 mm thick must be cut from the block of barrier face material. Please refer to Figure 2 for an illustration of how to locate these sections within the honeycomb block. Each of these larger samples must be cut into samples for certification testing (150 mm Ã— 150 mm Ã— 50 mm). Certification must be based on the testing of two samples from each of these four locations. The other two should be made available to the applicant, upon request. 
2.2. Sample size 
Samples of the following size must be used for testing: 
Length: 150 mm Â± 6 mm 
Width: 150 mm Â± 6 mm 
Thickness: 50 mm Â± 2 mm 
The walls of incomplete cells around the edge of the sample must be trimmed as follows: 
in the 'W` direction, the fringes must be no greater than 1,8 mm (see Figure 3), 
in the 'L` direction, half the length of one bonded cell wall (in the ribbon direction) must be left at either end of the specimen (see Figure 3). 
2.3. Area measurement 
The length of the sample must be measured in three locations, 12,7 mm from each end and in the middle, and recorded as L1, L2 and L3 (Figure 3). In the same manner, the width must be measured and recorded as W1, W2 and W3 (Figure 3). These measurements must be taken on the centreline of the thickness. The crush area must then be calculated as: 
A = %gt%NUM%gt%(L1+L2+L3) %gt%DEN%gt%3 Ã— %gt%NUM%gt%(W1+W2+W3) %gt%DEN%gt%3 
2.4. Crush rate and distance 
The sample must be crushed at a rate of not less than 5,1 mm/min and not more than 7,6 mm/min. The minimum crush distance is 16,5 mm. 
2.5. Data collection 
Force versus deflection data are to be collected in either analogue or digital form for each sample tested. If analogue data are collected then a means of converting this to digital must be available. All digital data must be collected at a rate of no less than 5 Hz (5 points per second). 
2.6. Crush strength determination 
Ignore all data prior to 6,4 mm of crush and after 16,5 mm of crush. Divide the remaining data into three sections or displacement intervals (n = 1,2,3) (see Figure 4) as follows: 
(1) 06,4-09,7 mm inclusive, 
(2) 09,7-13,2 mm exclusive, 
(3) 13,2-16,5 mm inclusive. 
Find the average for each section as follows: 
F(n) = %gt%NUM%gt%[F(n)1 + F(n)2 + . . . F(n)m] %gt%DEN%gt%m ; m= 1, 2, 3 
where m represents the number of data points measured in each of the three intervals. Calculate the crush strength of each section as follows: 
S(n) = %gt%NUM%gt%F(n) %gt%DEN%gt%A ; n= 1, 2, 3 
2.7. Sample crush strength specification 
For a honeycomb sample to pass this certification, the following condition must be met: 
0,308 MPa %amp%le; S(n) %amp%le; 0,342 MPa for 0,342 MPa material 
1,540 MPa %amp%le; (S(n) %amp%le; 1,711 MPa for 1,711 MPa material n = 1,2,3. 
2.8. Block crush strength specification 
Eight samples are to be tested from four locations, evenly spaced across the block. For a block to pass certification, seven of the eight samples must meet the crush strength specification of the previous section. 
3. ADHESIVE BONDING PROCEDURE 
3.1. Immediately before bonding, aluminium sheet surfaces to be bonded must be thoroughly cleaned using a suitable solvent, such as 1-1-1 Trichloroethane. This is to be carried out at least twice or as required to eliminate grease or dirt deposits. The cleaned surfaces must then be abraded using 120 grit abrasive paper. Metallic/silicon carbide abrasive paper is not to be used. The surfaces must be thoroughly abraded and the abrasive paper changed regularly during the process to avoid clogging, which may lead to a polishing effect. Following abrading, the surfaces must be thoroughly cleaned again, as above. In total, the surfaces must be solvent cleaned at least four times. All dust and deposits left as a result of the abrading process must be removed, as these will adversely affect bonding. 
3.2. The adhesive should be applied to one surface only, using a ribbed rubber roller. In cases where honeycomb is to be bonded to aluminium sheet, the adhesive should be applied to the aluminium sheet only. A maximum of 0,5 kg/mÂ² must be applied evenly over the surface, giving a maximum film thickness of 0,5 mm. 
4. CONSTRUCTION 
4.1. The main honeycomb block must be bonded to the backing sheet with adhesive such that the cell axes are perpendicular to the sheet. The cladding must be bonded to the front surface of the honeycomb block. The top and bottom surfaces of the cladding sheet must not be bonded to the main honeycomb block but should be positioned closely to it. The cladding sheet must be adhesively bonded to the backing sheet at the mounting flanges. 
4.2. The bumper element must be adhesively bonded to the front of the cladding sheet such that the cell axes are perpendicular to the sheet. The bottom of the bumper element must be flush with the bottom surface of the cladding sheet. The bumper facing sheet must be adhesively bonded to the front of the bumper element. 
4.3. The bumper element must then be divided into three equal sections by means of two horizontal slots. These slots must be cut through the entire depth of the bumper section and extend the whole width of the bumper. The slots must be cut using a saw; their width must be the width of the blade used and must not exceed 4,0 mm. 
4.4. Clearance holes for mounting the barrier are to be drilled in the mounting flanges (shown in Figure 5). The holes must be of 9,5 mm diameter. Five holes must be drilled in the top flange at a distance of 40 mm from the top edge of the flange and five in the bottom flange, 40 mm from the bottom edge of that flange. The holes must be at 100 mm, 300 mm, 500 mm, 700 mm, 900 mm from either edge of the barrier. All holes must be drilled to Â± 1 mm of the nominal distances. 
5. MOUNTING 
5.1. The deformable barrier must be rigidly fixed to the edge of a mass of not less than 7 Ã— 104 kg or to some structure attached thereto. The attachment of the barrier face must be such that the vehicle must not contact any part of the structure more than 75 mm from the top surface of the barrier (excluding the upper flange) during any stage of the impact (1). The front face of the surface to which the deformable barrier is attached must be flat and continuous over the height and width of the face and must be vertical Â± 1Â° and perpendicular Â± 1Â° to the axis of the run-up track. The attachment surface must not be displaced by more than 10 mm during the test. If necessary, additional anchorage or arresting devices must be used to prevent displacement of the concrete block. The edge of the deformable barrier must be aligned with the edge of the concrete block appropriate for the side of the vehicle to be tested. 
5.2. The deformable barrier must be fixed to the concrete block by means of ten bolts, five in the top mounting flange and five in the bottom. These bolts must be of at least 8 mm diameter. Steel clamping strips must be used for both the top and bottom mounting flanges (see Figures 1 and 5). These strips must be 60 mm high and 1 000 mm wide and have a thickness of at least 3 mm. Five clearance holes of 9,5 mm diameter must be drilled in both strips to correspond with those in the mounting flange on the barrier (see paragraph 4). None of the fixtures must fail in the impact test.
