(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
I. INTRODUCTION 
On 26 October 2004, the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation signed an Agreement on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis (the “Schengen agreement with Switzerland”)[1]. 
That Agreement anticipated Liechtenstein’s possible association with the Schengen acquis and made provision in its Article 16 for Liechtenstein to accede to the Agreement by means of a protocol determining the rights and obligations of each of the contracting parties. 
By letter dated 12 October 2001, Liechtenstein had already expressed its interest in joining Switzerland as a contracting party to a possible Schengen and Dublin acquis association agreement since an open border policy for the movement of persons had existed between Liechtenstein and Switzerland for decades. However, Liechtenstein was not associated with the negotiations with Switzerland on account of the absence of an agreement on savings taxation between the European Community and Liechtenstein. 
The European Community and Liechtenstein subsequently concluded such an agreement on savings taxation, which has been in operation since July 2005. 
By letter dated 10 June 2005 Liechtenstein confirmed that it wished to be associated with the Schengen and Dublin/Eurodac acquis. 
Following the authorization given by the Council to the Commission on 27.2.2006, negotiations were held with Liechtenstein and Switzerland. On 21.6.2006 negotiations were finalised and the draft protocol on Liechtenstein's accession to the Schengen agreement with Switzerland was initialled[2]. 
Given the fact that the Schengen agreement with Switzerland to which Liechtenstein accedes covers both first and third pillar items, the Commission proposes to follow the approach chosen for the signature and adoption of the Schengen agreement with Switzerland. The Commission proposes thus to adopt the Protocol by two separate acts, one based on the Treaty establishing the European Community (Articles 62, 63 (3), 66 and 95) and one based on the Treaty on European Union (Articles 24 and 38). 
Concerning the decision based on the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Council will decide by unanimity given the fact that Article 63 point 3 a) requires a unanimous vote of the Member States. The European Parliament will have to be consulted on the conclusion of the Agreement in accordance with Article 300 (3) of the EC Treaty. 
II. RESULTS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS 
The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft protocol is acceptable to the Community. 
The final content can be summarised as follows: 
Liechtenstein accedes to the Schengen agreement with Switzerland and will have the same rights and obligations as Switzerland. Liechtenstein will have to accept the entire Schengen acquis and the development thereof, with the sole exception granted also to Switzerland (Article 7 (5) of the Schengen agreement with Switzerland): 
If provisions of a new Schengen act or measure have the effect of no longer allowing Member States to subject compliance with requests for mutual assistance in criminal matters or the recognition of orders from other Member States to search premises and/or seize items of evidence to the conditions set out in Article 51 of the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement, Liechtenstein does not need to implement these provisions in its internal legal order where they apply to search and seizure requests or orders made for the purposes of investigating or prosecuting offences in the field of direct taxation which, if committed in Liechtenstein, would not be punishable under Liechtenstein law with a custodial penalty[3]. 
Apart from this exception, if Liechtenstein does not accept future developments of the Schengen acquis, the Protocol will cease to operate. 
Liechtenstein will become a member of the Mixed Committee and will have the right to express its opinion within the Mixed Committee and to preside it. 
The putting into effect of the Schengen protocol is linked to the putting into effect of the Dublin/Eurodac protocol, as well as to the putting into effect of the respective agreements between Liechtenstein and Denmark and between Liechtenstein and Norway and Iceland on Schengen. 
Specific provisions are laid down for Liechtenstein concerning the time period needed for the implementation of a development of the Schengen acquis, in case constitutional requirements need to be fulfilled by Liechtenstein (18 months) and the financial contribution that Liechtenstein has to pay for the administrative costs of the Council Working Groups, which meet in form of the Mixed Committee. The overall amount of these administrative costs are laid down in the Swiss agreement with an amount of € 8 100 000 and Liechtenstein will have to pay 0.071% of it. In addition, like Switzerland, Liechtenstein will have to contribute to the operational costs linked to the implementation of the Schengen acquis according to its GDP. Consequently, there are no financial implications for the EU resulting from Liechtenstein's association with the Schengen acquis. 
Given the existing cooperation with Switzerland in the field of visa policy and security matters which includes the use of common databases, Liechtenstein may use the technical infrastructure of Switzerland for its access to the Schengen Information System and the Visa Information System. 
III. CONCLUSIONS: 
In the light of the above considerations, the Commission proposes that the Council: 
- decides that the Protocol be signed on behalf of the European Union, on the one hand, and of the European Community, on the other hand, and authorises the President of the Council to appoint the person duly empowered to sign on behalf of the European Union, on the one hand, and of the European Community, on the other hand; 
- approves, after consulting the European Parliament, the attached Protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis on behalf of the European Union, on the one hand, and of the European Community, on the other hand.
