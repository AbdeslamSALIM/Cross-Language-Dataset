Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on a Community Position regarding Decision No. [2/2006] of the Community/Switzerland Air Transport Committee established under the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on Air Transport, amending the Annex to the Agreement 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
On 1 June 2002 the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on Air Transport entered into force. Article 21 of the Agreement establishes a Community/Switzerland Air Transport Committee which is responsible for the administration and proper implementation of the Agreement. 
New Community legislation to be included in the Annex to the Agreement 
Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Agreement provides for the application in Switzerland of Community legislation specified in the Annex to the Agreement. Article 23, paragraph 4 of the Agreement stipulates that the Community/Switzerland Air Transport Committee shall either adopt a decision revising the Annex or, if necessary, propose a revision of the provisions of the Agreement, so as to integrate therein, if necessary on a basis of reciprocity, the amendments made to the legislation in question. 
Since the signature of the Agreement in 1999, a range of new legislation has been introduced within the Community in the sector of air traffic management. On the occasion of the fourth meeting of the Community/Switzerland Air Transport Committee, which was held in Brussels on 25 November 2005, it was agreed in principle that Switzerland would incorporate the acquis related to the Single European Sky (SES): Regulation 549/2004 (the framework Regulation), Regulation 550/2004 (the service provision Regulation), Regulation 551/2004 (the airspace Regulation) and Regulation 552/2004 (the interoperability Regulation), as well as the first SES implementing acts: Regulation 2096/2005 (common requirements for the provision of air navigation services) and Regulation 2150/2005 (flexible use of airspace). 
Because Switzerland accepted that in relation to the SES legislation Community Institutions will have direct authority on its territory (“single pillar approach”) Switzerland can participate, as an observer, in the Single European Sky Committee, through a unilateral Declaration of the Council (similar to the unilateral declaration adopted by the Council in 2002 on Swiss participation in the aviation competition Committee and in the market access Committee, and similar to the solution found for the EASA Regulation 1592/2002). 
COMMUNITY POSITION ON DECISION 2/2006 
Decision (2002/309/EC, Euratom) of the Council and of the Commission as regards the Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation of 4 April 2002 on the conclusion of seven Agreements with the Swiss Confederation, provides in its Article 3 that the position to be taken by the Community as regards decisions of the Community/Switzerland Air Transport Committee which simply extend acts of Community legislation to Switzerland, subject to any technical adjustment needed, shall be adopted by the Commission[1]. 
For other Community/Switzerland Air Transport Committee decisions, the Community’s position shall be adopted by the Council, acting by qualified majority, on a proposal from the Commission[2]. 
As the solution which has been found cannot be defined as mere technical adjustments, it is for the Council to adopt the Community position on this Joint Aviation Committee Decision, on the basis of this Commission Proposal. 
Once this Community Position is adopted, the Community/Switzerland Air Transport Committee will adopt the Joint Committee Decision through the written procedure which is foreseen in its Rules of Procedure. 
The Council is invited to adopt the attached Decision.
