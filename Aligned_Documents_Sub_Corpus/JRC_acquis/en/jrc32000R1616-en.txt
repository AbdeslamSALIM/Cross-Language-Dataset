THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 of 24 June 1991 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs(1), as last amended by: Commission Regulation (EC) No 1437/2000(2), and in particular Article 11(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 11(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 stipulates that products which are imported from a third country may be marketed only where they originate from a third country appearing in a list drawn up in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 11(2) of the Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. Such list has been laid down in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 94/92(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 548/2000(4). 
(2) Argentina, and Switzerland introduced in the Commission a request to extend the product categories, included in the list provided for in Article 11(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, in order to include livestock and livestock products. They submitted the information required pursuant to Article 2(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 94/92. 
(3) The examination of this information and consequent discussion with their authorities has led to the conclusion that in these countries the rules governing production and inspection of livestock and livestock products are equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. However certain assurances are expected from the Argentinean authorities, therefore the equivalency for livestock and livestock products should be limited to a period of six months. 
(4) Israel has applied to the Commission to amend the terms of its inclusion in the list in order to permit the import of organically grown raw material. Israel has submitted the information required pursuant to Article 2(5) of Regulation (EEC) No 94/92. The examination of the information submitted has led to the conclusion that the requirements are equivalent to those resulting from the Community legislation. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee mentioned in Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
