Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2007-2010) 
(presented by the Commission) {SEC(2006) 1227} 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
The International Fund for Ireland (IFI) was established in 1986 in order to contribute to the implementation of Article 10(a) of the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 15 November 1985 which provides that "the two governments shall co-operate to promote the economic and social development of those areas of both parts of Ireland which have suffered most severely from the consequences of the instability of recent years, and shall consider the possibility of securing international support for this work" . 
The objectives of the IFI are "to promote economic and social advance and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland"*. 
Following early contributions from the United States and other countries, the European Community, recognising that the objectives of the IFI were a reflection of those pursued by itself, wished to give practical support to the initiative. It began contributing to the IFI in 1989. EC funding now represents approximately 48 % of annual contributions to the Fund and 40 % of cumulative contributions to date. The Commission has been represented by an observer at all IFI Board meetings since the beginning of 1989. 
The political background of the region has evolved over the years: in 1994, the main paramilitary groups announced cease-fires; in April 1998, the Belfast (“Good Friday”) Agreement set a political settlement for a peace process, including the devolution of powers to a Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive Committee, which were set up at the end of 1999. However, there is still a significant level of security related incidents with sectarian motivation and psychological and physical division between the main communities is on the rise. The NI Assembly is currently suspended, which illustrates the threats and uncertainties surrounding the peace process in the region. 
In this context, economic and social development in support of peace and reconciliation at grassroots level is a long term process. As an instrument towards this goal, the IFI complements the action carried out by the EU Programmes for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Region of Ireland ("PEACE "I 1995-1999, "PEACE II" 2000-2006 and "PEACE III" 2007-2013). 
Nevertheless, the International Fund knowing that the current level of international support cannot be maintained indefinitely, has performed, in 2005, a review of its structures and priorities in order to redefine its mission in light of the new realities and has adopted a strategic framework which will bring the life of the Fund to an end in 2010. This strategy is entitled "Sharing this Space" and launches the final phase of activities of the Fund (2006-2010). During this closing period the Fund will target the areas of greatest need and will seek to ensure that its work is made sustainable in the longer term. 
In accordance with the current round of contributions**, the European Commission has also submitted an assessment of the IFI’s activities to the Budgetary Authority***. This acknowledges the IFI’s very valuable and positive actions for peace and reconciliation in the region, and thereby the fulfilment of its objectives. The report concluded that "the Commission believes that funding after 2006 should be provided on the basis of the observations made in this report, which could be reflected either in the future Council Regulation on the EC contribution to the IFI, or through other appropriate means of co-operation between the Commission and the IFI". 
In light of the above assessment, it is proposed that EU contributions of € 15 million per year to the IFI continue for a further period of 4 years. The proposed new period will therefore end in 2010, which would coincide with the end of the life of the IFI. 
The new Council Regulation should also reflect the observations made in the Commission report, in particular those reinforcing synergy of objectives and co-ordination with Structural Funds interventions, in particular with the new PEACE Programme and the provisions on closure. 
The package of proposals for adoption include: 
- a proposal for a Council Regulation concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2007-2010); 
- a Communication from the Commission on the Report on the International Fund for Ireland pursuant to Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 177/2005. 
2006/0194 (CNS) 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2007-2010) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament[2], 
Whereas: 
(1) The International Fund for Ireland (hereinafter “the Fund”) was established in 1986 by the Agreement of 18 September 1986 between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the International Fund for Ireland (hereinafter “the Agreement”) in order to promote economic and social advance, and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland, in implementation of one of the objectives specified by the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 15 November 1985. 
(2) The Community has provided financial contributions to the Fund from 1989. For the period 2005 to 2006 EUR 15 million was committed from the Community budget for each of the years 2005 and 2006 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 177/2005 of 24 January 2005 on Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland[3]. That Regulation will expire on 31 December 2006. 
(3) The assessments carried out in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 177/2005 have confirmed the need for further support for activities of the Fund, while continuing reinforcing synergy of objectives and co-ordination with Structural Funds interventions, in particular with the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland (hereinafter “the PEACE programme”) set up in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds[4]. 
(4) The peace process in Northern Ireland requires a continuation of Community support to the Fund beyond 31 December 2006. In recognition of the special effort for the peace process, the PEACE programme has been allocated additional support from the Structural Funds for the period 2007 to 2013 pursuant to paragraph 22 of Annex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999[5]. 
(5) At its meeting in Brussels on 15 and 16 December 2005, the European Council called on the Commission to take the necessary steps with a view to continued Community support for the Fund as it enters the crucial final phase of its work up to 2010. 
(6) The Community contribution to the Fund should take the form of financial contributions for the years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010, thus terminating at the same time as the life of the Fund. 
(7) In allocating the Community contribution, the Fund should give priority to projects of a cross-border or cross-community nature, in such a way as to complement the activities funded by the PEACE programme for the period 2007 to 2010. 
(8) In accordance with the Agreement, all financial contributors to the Fund participate as observers at the meetings of the Board of the International Fund for Ireland. 
(9) It is vital to ensure proper co-ordination between the activities of the Fund and those financed under the Community Structural Funds provided for by Article 159 of the Treaty, in particular the PEACE programme. 
(10) Assistance from the Fund should be regarded as effective only in so far as it brings about sustainable economic and social improvement and is not used as a substitute for other public or private expenditure. 
(11) An assessment reviewing the closure provisions of the Fund should be carried out before 1 July 2008. 
(12) A financial reference amount, within the meaning of Point 38 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management[6] is inserted in this Regulation for the entire duration of the programme, without the powers of the budgetary authority as defined by the Treaty being affected thereby. 
(13) The amount of the Community contribution to the Fund should be EUR 15 million for each of the years 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, expressed in current values. 
(14) That support will contribute to reinforcing solidarity between the Member States and between their peoples. 
(15) The Treaty provides no powers other than those in Article 308 for the adoption of this Regulation, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
The financial reference amount for the implementation of the International Fund for Ireland (hereinafter “the Fund”) for the period 2007-2010 shall be EUR 60 million.

In allocating the contribution the Fund shall give priority to projects of a cross-border or cross-community nature, in such a way as to complement the activities financed by the Structural Funds, and especially those of the PEACE programme operating in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland. 
The contribution shall be used in such a way as to bring about sustainable economic and social improvement in the areas concerned. It shall not be used as a substitute for other public and private expenditure.

(b) a second advance payment of 40% shall be made six months later; 
(c) a final payment of 20% shall be made after the Commission has received and accepted the Fund’s annual activity report and audited accounts for the year in question. 
2. Before paying out an instalment the Commission shall carry out an assessment of the Fund’s financial needs on the basis of the Fund’s cash balance at the time scheduled for each payment. If following that assessment, the Fund’s financial needs do not justify payment of one of those instalments, the payment concerned shall be suspended. The Commission shall review that decision on the basis of new information provided by the Fund and shall continue payments as soon as they are considered justified. 
Article 8 
A contribution from the Fund may be allocated to an operation which receives or is due to receive financial assistance under a Structural Funds intervention, only if the sum of that financial assistance plus 40% of the contribution from the Fund does not exceed 75% of the operation’s total eligible costs.

8. FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION 
8.1. Follow-up arrangements 
The Commission will monitor the Fund’s activities through its continuing presence on the Board as an observer. It is informed of all the Fund’s proposed decisions before they are put to the Board. The Fund operations are moreover controlled by DG REGIO audit and control services. The result indicators will be the number and value of projects approved by the IFI. 
8.2. Arrangements and schedule for the planned evaluation 
Every year the IFI presents to the Commission its annual accounts and activity report which must satisfy the Commission in order for the payments to the Fund to continue. Moreover, the payments to the Fund are also subject to an assessment of the Fund’s financial needs to be carried out by the Commission on the basis of the Fund’s cash balance at the time scheduled for each payment. 
Given that the Fund will come to an end in 2010 it must submit to the Commission by June 2008 at the latest, its strategy for the closure of the Fund's activities and subsequent payments to the Fund are conditional on the Commission's approval of the closure strategy. 
A Final Report should be submitted to the Commission six months before the winding up date foreseen in the strategy for closure in Article 6(a) of this Regulation or six months after the last Community payment, whichever happens first and should include all the necessary information that would enable the Commission to evaluate the implementation of the assistance and the attainment of the objectives. 
9. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES 
The Commission is represented on the Board of the Fund and the final annual contribution is only paid over after receipt and acceptance of the Fund's annual report and audited accounts. The Fund operations are moreover controlled by DG REGIO audit and control services.
