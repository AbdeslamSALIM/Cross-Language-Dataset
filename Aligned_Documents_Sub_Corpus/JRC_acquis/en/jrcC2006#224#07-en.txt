Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Verwaltungsgericht Frankfurt am Main — Validity of Arts. 25(1) and 35(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 of 14 December 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards the import arrangements for milk and milk products and opening tariff quotas (OJ 2001 L 341, p. 29) — Issue of an import certificate, for which an application may be submitted only in the United Kingdom, for New Zealand butter subject to the requirement of presentation of an Inward Monitoring Arrangement (IMA 1) certificate — Infringement of Arts. 28, 34(2) and 82, first paragraph, EC and of Arts 26(2) and 29(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 (OJ 1999 L 160, p. 48) — Infringement of Art. XVII 1(a) of the GATT agreement — Infringement of Art. 1(3) of the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures (OJ 1994 L 336, p. 151) 
Operative part of the judgment 
1. Article 35(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 of 14 December 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards the import arrangements for milk and milk products and opening tariff quotas is invalid inasmuch as it provides that applications for import licences for New Zealand butter at reduced duty may be lodged solely with the competent authorities of the United Kingdom. 
2. Articles 25 and 32 of Regulation No 2535/2001, read in conjunction with Annexes III, IV and XII to that regulation, are invalid since they permit discrimination in the issue of import licences for New Zealand butter at reduced duty.
