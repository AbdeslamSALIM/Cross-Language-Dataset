Commission Regulation (EC) No 1228/2002 
of 8 July 2002 
concerning the issue of import licences for certain preserved mushrooms and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1218/2002 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2125/95 of 6 September 1995 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for preserved mushrooms(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 453/2002(2), and in particular Article 6(4) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2125/95 lays down that where the quantities applied for exceed the quantity available, the Commission must set a flat-rate percentage reduction and suspend the issue of licences in respect of subsequent applications. 
(2) The quantities applied for on 1 and 2 July 2002 under Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 2125/95 for products originating in China exceed the available quantities. The extent to which licences may be issued and how long the issue of licences for all subsequent applications should be suspended should therefore be determined. 
(3) A check has shown that clear errors affecting all the operators concerned have been made in Regulation (EC) No 1218/2002 concerning the issue of import licences for certain preserved mushrooms. This Regulation must therefore be repealed and replaced with effect from the date of its entry into force, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
