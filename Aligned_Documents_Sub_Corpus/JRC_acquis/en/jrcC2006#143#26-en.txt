Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale per la Secilia — Interpretation of Article 3(3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 of 7 December 1992 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage) (OJ 1992 L 364, p. 7) — Law applicable to the manning of vessels over 650 gt carrying out island cabotage –Meaning of voyage which follows or precedes a voyage to or from another Member State 
Operative part of the judgment 
A %quot%voyage which follows or precedes%quot% the cabotage voyage, as referred to in Article 3(3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 of 7 December applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritme cabotoge), means in principle any voyage to or from another State, whether or not the vessel has cargo on board. However, sham voyages without cargo on board carried out to circumvent Regulation (EC) No 3577/92 cannot be permitted. Such an abuse can be found to exist only if, first, notwithstanding that technically the conditions laid down by Article 3(3) of the regulation apply, the result of the international voyage in ballast is that the shipowner benefits, in respect of all matters relating to manning from the application of the law of the flag State, frustrating the aim of Article 3(2) of the regulation, which is to allow the application of the law of the host State to all matters relating to manning in the case of island cabotage. Second, there must also be objective evidence to show that the essential aim of the international voyage in ballast is to avoid the application of Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 3577/92, in favour of Article 3(3).
