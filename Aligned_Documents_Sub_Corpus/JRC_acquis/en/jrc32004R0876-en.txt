(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 260/2003(2) and 1915/2003(3) amend Regulation 999/2001 to introduce eradication measures for holdings infected with scrapie, and amend the trade conditions for breeding sheep to allow unrestricted trade in sheep of the ARR/ARR prion protein genotype. 
(3) Monitoring requirements for holdings wishing to send breeding sheep and goats for intra-community trade should be amended to reflect the more vigourous approach being adopted to scrapie eradication. The restrictions on animals entering these holdings should no longer extend to sheep of the ARR/ARR prion protein genotype. 
(4) The new provisions should be introduced in two stages, to allow heightened surveillance in the short term, while preventing disruption of trade. 
(5) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
