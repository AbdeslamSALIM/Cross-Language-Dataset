Commission Regulation (EC) No 2287/2000 
of 13 October 2000 
amending Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds and Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk producdts 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1670/2000(2), and in particular Aricle 31(14) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1000/2000(4) establishes, on the basis of the Combined Nomenclature, an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds. 
(2) The refund nomenclature currently lays down only a minimum fat content. In view of the adoption by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, at its session of 28 June to 3 July 1999, of a minimum milk-protein content for certain milk products that will be generally recognised and applied in international trade, the nomenclature should be amended with the insertion of the same minimum protein content and a maximum water content for the products concerned. 
(3) In the interests of simplification, those codes relating to products for which there is no longer a refund or for which no licence applications have been received since July 1995 should be deleted. In addition, the refund granted for skimmed milk powder incorporated in certain compound feedingstuffs should be abolished (and the relevant codes deleted), since those products are eligible for aid when skimmed milk powder is incorporated. 
(4) Annex II to Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1961/2000(6), lays down the product groups for which, on certain conditions, a refund is granted for a product different from that for which the refund was fixed in advance. That Annex should be adjusted in line with the proposed amendments. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,
