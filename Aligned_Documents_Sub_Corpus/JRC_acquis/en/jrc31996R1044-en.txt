THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 894/96 (2), and in particular Article 13 (12) thereof, 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 773/96 (3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 957/96 (4), lays down special measures for the regularization of certain export transactions in the wake of the measures taken by several third countries to safeguard against bovine spongiform encephalopathy;
