Date of adoption of the decision : 23.11.2005 
Member State : Denmark 
Aid No : N 568/04 
Title : Compensation for losses due to the presence of certain GMO material 
Objective : 
In order to provide adequate coverage for the risk involved and thus to contribute to the successful establishment of the co-existence between GM and other crops the Danish authorities have decided to set up a compensation scheme financed by the growers of GM crops. 
Each farmer cultivating genetically modified crops shall pay a cultivation fee of 100 DKK per hectare of land cultivated with such crops. The cultivation fees are integrally used to constitute a compensation fund, from which compensation would be paid to farmers who have sustained economic losses due to the presence of GM material in their crops. 
Payment of compensation is limited to cases where GM material is found in the same non-GM crop as the GM crop or in a crop closely related to the GM crop (GM crops that can be crossed into non-GM crops) in the same season and within a specified area (distance from the GM crops). In the cultivation of organically grown seed only the condition concerning the season applies. 
Compensation for losses can be paid only if the occurrence of GM material in the claimant's crop, as defined above, exceeds the threshold of 0,9 per cent. The threshold is the limit under which genetically modified food or feedstuffs do not have to be labelled for containing genetically modified organisms, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. 
The amount of compensation is limited to the price difference between the market price of a crop that has to be labelled as containing GM material and a crop for which no such labelling is required (i.e. GM material content less than 0,9 per cent). The market price will be determined by the Danish Plant Directorate on the basis of the monthly statistics from the Institute for Food economics (FØI) 
Legal basis : Lov nr. 436 af 9. juni om dyrkning m.v. af genetisk modificerede afgrøder; bekendtgørelse om kompensation for tab på grund af visse forekomster af genetisk modificeret materiale (udkast). 
Budget : DKK 300000/EUR 40540 in 2005 
Aid intensity or amount : 100 % of the eligible costs 
Duration : 5 years 
Other information : It is the intention of the Danish authorities to limit the duration of the compensation scheme until a privately financed insurance solution is found
