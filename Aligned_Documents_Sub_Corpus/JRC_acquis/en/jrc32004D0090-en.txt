PART I 
1. General 
When performing measurements on a vehicle as described in this Part, the vehicle should be positioned in its normal ride attitude as described in point 2.3. If the vehicle is fitted with a badge, mascot or other structure which would bend back or retract under a low applied load, then such a load shall be applied before and/or while these measurements are taken. Any vehicle component which could change shape or position, such as %quot%pop-up%quot% headlights, other than suspension components or active devices to protect pedestrians, shall be set to a shape or position that the test institutes, in consultation with the manufacturer, consider to be the most appropriate while taking these measurements. 
2. Definitions 
For the purposes of this Decision: 
2.1. %quot%Vehicle type%quot% means a category of vehicles which, forward of the A-pillars, do not differ in such essential respects as: 
- the structure, 
- the main dimensions, 
- the materials of the outer surfaces of the vehicle, 
- the component arrangement (external or internal), 
in so far as they may be considered to have a negative effect on the results of the impact tests prescribed in Part II. 
Vehicles of category N1 described as being derived from M1 category refer to those vehicles of N1 category which, forward of the A-pillars, have the same general structure and shape as a pre-existing M1 category vehicle. 
2.2. %quot%Primary reference marks%quot% means holes, surfaces, marks and identification signs on the vehicle body. The type of reference mark used and the vertical (Z) position of each mark relative to the ground shall be specified by the vehicle manufacturer according to the running conditions specified in point 2.3. These marks shall be selected such as to be able to easily check the vehicle front and rear ride heights and vehicle attitude. 
If the primary reference marks are found to be within ± 25 mm of the design position in the vertical (Z) axis, then the design position shall be considered to be the normal ride height. If this condition is met, either the vehicle shall be adjusted to the design position, or all further measurements shall be adjusted, and tests performed, to simulate the vehicle being at the design position. 
2.3. %quot%Normal ride attitude%quot% is the vehicle attitude in running order positioned on the ground, with the tyres inflated to the recommended pressures, the front wheels in the straight-ahead position, with maximum capacity of all fluids necessary for operation of the vehicle, with all standard equipment as provided by the vehicle manufacturer, with a 75 kg mass placed on the driver's seat and with a 75 kg mass placed on the front passenger's seat, and with the suspension set for a driving speed of 40 km/h or 35 km/h in normal running conditions specified by the manufacturer (especially for vehicles with an active suspension or a device for automatic levelling). 
2.4. %quot%Ground reference level%quot% is the horizontal plane parallel to the ground level, representing the ground level for a vehicle placed at rest on a flat surface with the hand brake on, with the vehicle positioned in its normal ride attitude. 
2.5. %quot%Bumper%quot% is the front, lower, outer structure of a vehicle. It includes all structures that are intended to give protection to a vehicle when involved in a low speed frontal collision with another vehicle and also any attachments to this structure. The reference height and lateral limits of the bumper are identified by the corners and the bumper reference lines as defined in points 2.5.1 to 2.5.5. 
2.5.1. %quot%The upper bumper reference line%quot% identifies the upper limit to significant points of pedestrian contact with the bumper. It is defined as the geometric trace of the upper most points of contact between a straight edge 700 mm long and the bumper, when the straight edge, held parallel to the vertical longitudinal plane of the car and inclined rearwards by 20°, is traversed across the front of the car, while maintaining contact with the ground and with the surface of the bumper (see Figure 1a). 
Where necessary the straight edge shall be shortened to avoid any contact with structures above the bumper. 
2.5.2. %quot%The lower bumper reference line%quot% identifies the lower limit to significant points of pedestrian contact with the bumper. It is defined as the geometric trace of the lower most points of contact between a straight edge 700 mm long and the bumper, when the straight edge, held parallel to the vertical longitudinal plane of the car and inclined forwards by 25°, is traversed across the front of the car, while maintaining contact with the ground and with the surface of the bumper (see Figure 1b). 
2.5.3. %quot%Upper bumper height%quot% is the vertical distance between the ground and the upper bumper reference line, defined in point 2.5.1 with the vehicle positioned in its normal ride attitude. 
2.5.4. %quot%Lower bumper height%quot% is the vertical distance between the ground and the lower bumper reference line, defined in point 2.5.2 with the vehicle positioned in its normal ride attitude. 
2.5.5. %quot%Corner of bumper%quot% is defined as the vehicle's point of contact with a vertical plane which makes an angle of 60° with the vertical longitudinal plane of the car and is tangential to the outer surface of the bumper (see Figure 2). 
2.5.6. %quot%Third of the bumper%quot% is defined as the geometric trace between the %quot%Corners of the bumper%quot% as defined in point 2.5.5, measured with a flexible tape following the outer contour of the bumper, divided in three equal parts. 
2.6. %quot%Bumper lead%quot% for any section of a car is the horizontal distance between the upper bumper reference line, as defined in point 2.5.1 and the bonnet leading edge reference line, as defined in point 2.9.2. 
2.7. %quot%Frontal upper surface%quot% is the outer structure that includes the upper surface of all outer structures except the windscreen, the A-pillars and structure rearwards of them. It therefore includes, but is not limited to, the bonnet, wings, scuttle, wiper spindle and lower windscreen frame. 
2.8. %quot%1000 mm wrap around distance%quot% is the geometric trace described on the frontal upper surface by one end of a 1000 mm long flexible tape, when it is held in a vertical fore and aft plane of the car and traversed across the front of the bonnet and bumper. The tape is held taut throughout the operation with one end held in contact with the ground, vertically below the front face of the bumper and the other end held in contact with the frontal upper surface (see Figure 3). The vehicle is positioned in the normal ride attitude. 
Similar procedures shall be followed, using alternative tapes of appropriate lengths to describe 1500 and 2100 mm wrap around distances. 
2.9. %quot%Bonnet top%quot% is the area which is bounded by (a), (b) and (c) as follows: 
(a) the bonnet leading edge reference line, as defined in point 2.9.2; 
(b) the bonnet side reference lines as defined in point 2.9.4; 
(c) the bonnet rear reference line as defined in point 2.9.7. 
2.9.1. %quot%Bonnet leading edge%quot% is the front upper outer structure including the bonnet and wings, the upper and side members of the headlight surround and any other attachments. The reference line identifying the position of the leading edge is defined by its height above the ground and by the horizontal distance separating it from the bumper (bumper lead), determined in accordance with points 2.6, 2.9.2 and 2.9.3. 
2.9.2. %quot%Bonnet leading edge reference line%quot% is defined as the geometric trace of the points of contact between a straight edge 1000 mm long and the front surface of the bonnet, when the straight edge, held parallel to the vertical longitudinal plane of the car and inclined rearwards by 50° and with the lower end 600 mm above the ground, is traversed across and in contact with the bonnet leading edge (See Figure 4). For vehicles having the bonnet top surface inclined at essentially 50°, so that the straight edge makes a continuous contact or multiple contacts rather than a point contact, determine the reference line with the straight edge inclined rearwards at an angle of 40°. For vehicles of such shape that the bottom end of the straight edge makes first contact then that contact is taken to be the bonnet leading edge reference line, at that lateral position. For vehicles of such shape that the top end of the straight edge makes first contact then the geometric trace of 1000 mm wrap around distance as defined in point 2.8, will be used as bonnet leading edge reference line at that lateral position. 
The top edge of the bumper shall also be regarded as the bonnet leading edge for this Commitment, if it is contacted by the straight edge during this procedure. 
2.9.3. %quot%Bonnet leading edge height%quot% for any section of a car is the vertical distance between the ground and the bonnet leading edge reference line defined in point 2.9.2, with the vehicle positioned in its normal ride attitude. 
2.9.4. %quot%Bonnet side reference line%quot% is defined as the geometric trace of the highest points of contact between a straight edge 700 mm long and the side of a bonnet, when the straight edge, held parallel to the lateral vertical plane of the car and inclined inwards by 45° is traversed down the side of the Frontal Upper Surface, while maintaining contact with the surface of the body shell (see Figure 5). 
2.9.5. %quot%Corner reference point%quot% is the intersection of the bonnet leading edge reference line and of the bonnet side reference line (see Figure 6). 
2.9.6. %quot%Third of the bonnet leading edge%quot% is defined as the geometric trace between the %quot%Corner reference points%quot% as defined in point 2.9.5, measured with a flexible tape following the outer contour of the leading edge, divided in three equal parts. 
2.9.7. %quot%Bonnet rear reference line%quot% is defined as the geometric trace of the most rearward points of contact between a sphere and the Frontal Upper Surface, as defined in point 2.7, when the sphere is traversed across the Frontal Upper Surface, while maintaining contact with the windscreen (see Figure 7). The wiper blades and arms are removed during this process. For the tests described in Section 3.1 of Annex I to the Directive, the diameter of the sphere is 165 mm. For the tests described in Section 3.2 of Annex I to the Directive, the diameter of the sphere is 165 mm if the lower windscreen frame on the vehicle's centre line is located at a wrap around distance, as defined in point 2.8, of 1500 mm or more from the ground and the diameter of the sphere is 130 mm when this wrap around distance is less than 1500 mm. If the bonnet rear reference line is located at a wrap around distance of more than 2100 mm from the ground, the bonnet rear reference line is defined by the geometric trace of the 2100 mm wrap around distances, as defined in point 2.8. Where the Bonnet Rear Reference Line and bonnet side reference Lines do not intersect, the Bonnet Rear Reference Line is modified according to the procedure outlined in point 2.9.9. 
2.9.8. %quot%Third of the bonnet top%quot% is defined as the geometric trace between the %quot%Bonnet side reference lines%quot% as defined in point 2.9.4, measured with a flexible tape following the outer contour of the bonnet top, divided in three equal parts. 
2.9.9. %quot%Intersection bonnet rear reference line and bonnet side reference line%quot% where the bonnet rear reference line and bonnet side reference line do not intersect, the bonnet rear reference line should be extended and/or modified using a semi-circular template, of radius 100 mm. The template should be made of a thin flexible sheet material that easily bends to a single curvature in any direction. The template should, preferably, resist double or complex curvature where this could result in wrinkling. The recommended material is a foam backed thin plastic sheet to allow the template to %quot%grip%quot% the surface of the vehicle. The template should be marked up with four points %quot%A%quot% through %quot%D%quot%, as shown in Figure 8, while the template is on a flat surface. 
The template should be placed on the vehicle with Corners %quot%A%quot% and %quot%B%quot% coincident with the side reference line. Ensuring these two corners remain coincident with the side reference line, the template should be slid progressively rearwards until the arc of the template makes first contact with the bonnet rear reference line. Throughout the process, the template should be curved to follow, as closely as possible, the outer contour of the vehicle's bonnet op, without wrinkling or folding of the template. If the contact between the template and bonnet rear reference line is tangential and the point of tangency lies outside the arc scribed by points %quot%C%quot% and %quot%D%quot%, then the bonnet rear reference line is extended and/or modified to follow the circumferential arc of the template to meet the bonnet side reference line, as shown in Figure 9. 
If the template cannot make simultaneous contact with the bonnet side reference line at points %quot%A%quot% and %quot%B%quot% and tangentially with the bonnet rear reference line, or the point at which the bonnet rear reference line and template touch lies within the arc scribed by points %quot%C%quot% and %quot%D%quot%, then additional templates should be used where the radii are increased progressively in increments of 20 mm, until all the above criteria are met. 
Once defined, the modified bonnet rear reference line is assumed in all subsequent paragraphs and the original ends of the line are no longer used. 
2.10. %quot%Head performance criterion (HPC)%quot% shall be calculated from the resultant of accelerometer time histories as the maximum (depending on t1 and t2) of the equation: 
%gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% 
where %quot%a%quot% is the resultant acceleration as a multiple of %quot%g%quot%, and t1 and t2 are the two time instants (expressed in seconds) during the impact, defining the beginning and the end of the recording for which the value of HPC is a maximum. Values of HPC for which the time interval (t1 - t2) is greater than 15 ms are ignored for the purposes of calculating the maximum value. 
2.11. %quot%Windscreen%quot% is the frontal glazing of the vehicle which meets all the relevant requirements of Annex I to EU Directive 77/649/EEC. 
2.11.1 %quot%Rear windscreen reference line%quot% is defined as the geometric trace of the most forward points of contact between a sphere and the windscreen, as defined in paragraph 2.11, when a sphere of diameter 165 mm is traversed across the windscreen top frame, including any trim, while maintaining contact with the windscreen (see Figure 10).

The impactor shall meet the performance requirements specified in Section 2 of Appendix I, and shall be fitted with deformable knee elements from the same batch as those used in the certification tests. The impactor shall also be fitted with foam cut from one of up to four consecutive sheets of ConforTM foam flesh material produced from the same batch of manufacture (cut from one block or bun of foam), provided that foam from one of these sheets was used in the dynamic certification test and the individual weights of these sheets are within ± 2 % of the weight of the sheet used in the certification test. The certified impactor may be used for a maximum of 20 impacts before re-certification. With each test new plastically deformable knee elements should be used. The impactor shall also be re-certified if more than one year has elapsed since the previous certification or if any impactor transducer output, in any impact, has exceeded the specified CAC.

3.4.2.4. The bottom of the impactor shall be at ground reference level at the time of first contact with the bumper (see Figure 2), with a ± 10 mm tolerance. 
When setting the height of the propulsion system, an allowance must be made for the influence of gravity during the period of free flight of the impactor. 
At the time of first contact the impactor shall have the intended orientation about its vertical axis, for the correct operation of its knee joint, with a tolerance of ± 5° (see Figure 3). 
3.4.2.5. At the time of first contact the centre line of the impactor shall be within a ± 10 mm tolerance to the selected impact location.

4.2. The %quot%centre of the knee%quot% is defined as the point about which the knee effectively bends. 
The %quot%femur%quot% is defined as all components or parts of components (including flesh, skin covering, damper, instrumentation and brackets, pulleys, etc. attached to the impactor for the purpose of launching it) above the level of the centre of the knee. 
The %quot%tibia%quot% is defined as all components or parts of components (including flesh, skin covering, instrumentation and brackets, pulleys, etc. attached to the impactor for the purpose of launching it) below the level of the centre of the knee. Note that the tibia as defined includes allowances for the mass etc. of the foot. 
4.3. The total mass of the femur and tibia shall be 8,6 ± 0,1 kg and 4,8 ± 0,1 kg respectively, and the total mass of the impactor shall be 13,4 ± 0,2 kg.

3. Specification of the test 
3.1. The purpose of the test is to ensure that the requirements given in paragraphs 3.1.1.2 and 3.2.1.2 of Annex I of the Directive 2003/102/EC are fulfilled. 
3.2. Upper legform to bumper tests shall be carried out to test positions selected in paragraph 3.2, Chapter II of this Part, if the lower bumper height at the test position is more than 500 mm and the manufacturer elects to perform an upper legform test instead of a lower legform test. In exceptional cases, and only with regard to the test procedure applicable under point 3.1.1.2 of Annex I of the Directive, manufacturers may apply for a derogation concerning the application of this alternative test to vehicles with a lower bumper height of less that 500 mm. 
3.3. Manufacturers may apply for derogation concerning an exemption zone for a removable towing hook. 
3.4. Test method

CHAPTER VII 
Child and adult headform to bonnet top tests 
1. Scope 
This test procedure is applicable to Section 3.2 of Annex I of the Directive 2003/102/EC. 
2. General 
2.1. The headform impactors for the bonnet top tests shall be in %quot%free flight%quot% at the moment of impact. The impactors shall be released to free flight at such a distance from the vehicle that the test results are not influenced by contact of the impactors with the propulsion system during rebound of the impactors. 
2.2. The impactors may be propelled by an air, spring or hydraulic gun, or by other means that can be shown to give the same result. 
3. Specification of the test 
3.1. The purpose of the test is to ensure that the requirements given in points 3.2.2 and 3.2.4 of Annex I of the Directive 2003/102/EC are fulfilled. 
3.2. Headform impactor tests shall be to the bonnet top as defined in point 2.9 of Part I. Tests to the forward section of the bonnet top defined in point 3.4.2.3 shall be with a child headform impactor defined in point 3.4.1.1. Tests to the rearward section of the bonnet top defined in point 3.4.2.4 shall be with an adult headform impactor, defined in point 3.4.1.1. A minimum of nine tests shall be carried out with each headform impactor, three tests each to the middle and the outer thirds of the forward and rearward bonnet top sections, as described in point 2.9.8 of Part I, at positions judged to be the most likely to cause injury. Tests shall be to different types of structure, where these vary throughout the area to be assessed. 
3.3. The selected test points for the adult headform impactor shall be a minimum of 165 mm apart, a minimum of 82,5 mm inside the defined bonnet side reference lines and a minimum of 82,5 mm forwards of the defined bonnet rear reference line. The test points shall be located so that the impactor is not expected to impact the bonnet top with a glancing blow and then impact the windscreen or an A pillar more severely. The selected test points for the child headform impactor shall be a minimum of 130 mm apart, a minimum of 65 mm inside the defined bonnet side reference lines, a minimum of 65 mm forwards of the defined bonnet rear reference line. Each selected test point for the child headform shall also be a minimum of 130 mm rearwards of the bonnet leading edge reference line, unless no point in the bonnet leading edge test area within 130 mm laterally would, if chosen for an upper legform to bonnet leading edge test, require a kinetic energy of impact of more than 200 J. 
These minimum distances are to be set with a flexible tape held tautly along the outer surface of the vehicle. If a number of test positions have been selected in order of potential to cause injury and the test area remaining is too small to select another test position while maintaining the minimum spacing between tests, then less than nine tests may be performed.

2.1.1. The lower legform impactor shall meet the requirements specified in point 2.1.2 when tested as specified in point 2.1.4 and the impactor shall meet the requirements specified in point 2.1.3 when tested as specified in point 2.1.5. 
For both tests the impactor shall have the intended orientation about its longitudinal axis, for the correct operation of its knee joint, with a tolerance of ± 2°. 
The stabilised temperature of the impactor during certification shall be 20 °C ± 2 °C. 
The CAC response values, as defined in ISO 6487:2000, shall be 50° for the knee bending angle and 500 N for the applied force when the impactor is loaded in bending in accordance with point 2.1.4, and 10 mm for the shearing displacement and 10 kN for the applied force when the impactor is loaded in shearing in accordance with point 2.1.5. For both tests low-pass filtering at an appropriate frequency is permitted, to remove higher frequency noise without significantly affecting the measurement of the response of the impactor. 
2.1.2. When the impactor is loaded in bending in accordance with point 2.1.4, the applied force/bending angle response shall be within the limits shown in Figure 1. Also, the energy taken to generate 15,0° of bending shall be 100 ± 7 J. 
2.1.3. When the impactor is loaded in shearing in accordance with point 2.1.5, the applied force/shearing displacement response shall be within the limits shown in Figure 2. 
2.1.4. The legform impactor, without foam covering and skin, shall be mounted with the tibia firmly clamped to a fixed horizontal surface and a metal tube connected firmly to the femur, as shown in Figure 3. To avoid friction errors, no support shall be provided to the femur section or the metal tube. The bending moment applied at the centre of the knee joint, due to the weight of the metal tube and other components (excluding the legform itself), shall not exceed 25 Nm. 
A horizontal normal force shall be applied to the metal tube at a distance of 2,0 ± 0,01 m from the centre of the knee joint and the resulting angle of knee deflection shall be recorded. The load shall be increased until the angle of deflection of the knee is in excess of 22°.
