European Parliament legislative resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a multiannual Community programme on promoting safer use of the Internet and new online technologies (COM(2004)0091 %mdash% C5-0132/2004 %mdash% 2004/0023(COD)) 
P6_TC1-COD(2004)0023 
Position of the European Parliament adopted at first reading on 2 December 2004 with a view to the adoption of Decision No .../2005/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a multiannual Community Programme on promoting safer use of the Internet and new online technologies 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 153(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission [1], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [2], 
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions [3], 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [4], 
Whereas: 
(1) Internet penetration and use of new technologies such as mobile phones is still growing considerably in the Community. Alongside this, dangers, especially for children, and abuse of the technologies continue to exist and new dangers and abuses are emerging. In order to encourage the exploitation of the opportunities offered by the Internet and new online technologies, measures are also needed to promote their safer use and protect the end-user from unwanted content. 
(2) The "eEurope 2005 Action Plan" [5], developing the Lisbon strategy, aims to stimulate secure services, applications and content based on a widely available broadband infrastructure. Among its objectives are a secure information infrastructure, development, analysis and dissemination of good practices, benchmarking and a co-ordination mechanism for e-policies. 
(3) The legislative framework which is being defined at Community level to deal with the challenges of digital content in the Information Society now includes rules related to online services, notably those on unsolicited commercial e-mail in Directive 2002/58/EC [6] and on important aspects of the liability of intermediary service providers in Directive 2000/31/EC [7], and recommendations for Member States, the industry and parties concerned and the Commission together with the indicative guidelines of Recommendation 98/560/EC [8]. 
(4) There will be a continued need for action both in the area of content potentially harmful to children or unwanted by the end user and in the area of illegal content, in particular child pornography and racist material. 
(5) Reaching international agreement on legally binding basic rules is desirable but will not be easily achieved. Even if such agreement is reached, it will not be enough in itself to ensure implementation of the rules or to ensure protection of those at risk. 
(6) The Safer Internet Action Plan [9] (1998-2004) has provided Community financing which has successfully encouraged a variety of initiatives and has given European added value. Further funding will help new initiatives to build on the work already accomplished. 
(7) Practical measures are still needed to encourage reporting of illegal content to those in a position to deal with it, to encourage assessment of the performance of filter technologies and the benchmarking of these technologies, to spread best practice for codes of conduct embodying generally agreed canons of behaviour, and to inform and educate parents and children on the best way to benefit from the potential of new media in a safe way. 
(8) Action at Member State level is essential involving a wide range of actors from national, regional and local government, network operators, parents, teacher and school administrators. The Community can stimulate best practice in Member States by carrying out an orientation role both within the EU and internationally and providing support for European-level benchmarking, networking and applied research. 
(9) International co-operation is also essential and can be stimulated, co-ordinated, relayed and implemented by action through the Community networking structures. 
(10) The measures that the Commission is empowered to adopt under the implementing powers conferred on it by this Decision are essentially management measures relating to the implementation of a Programme with substantial budgetary implications within the meaning of Article 2(a) of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [10]. Those measures should therefore be adopted in accordance with the management procedure provided for in Article 4 of that Decision. 
(11) Complementarity and synergy with related Community initiatives and programmes should be ensured by the Commission, including, inter alia, by taking into account the work performed by other bodies. 
(12) This Decision lays down, for the entire duration of the Programme, a financial framework constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure [11], for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure. 
(13) Since the objectives of the proposed actions cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States due to the transnational character of the issues at stake and can, therefore, by reason of the European scope and effects of the actions be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. 
(14) This Decision respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular Articles 7 and 8 thereof.

-------------------------------------------------- 
ANNEX I 
ACTIONS 
1. Action 1: Fighting against illegal content 
Hotlines allow members of the public to report illegal content. They pass the reports on to the appropriate body for action (Internet Service Provider (ISP), police or correspondent hotline). Civilian hotlines complement police hotlines, where these exist. Their role is distinct from that of the law enforcement authorities, since they do not investigate offences or arrest or prosecute offenders. They may constitute centres of expertise providing guidance to ISPs as to what content might be illegal. 
The existing hotline network is a unique organisation that would not have been set up without EU funding. As pointed out in the Programme evaluation 2002, the network has been very successful in expanding membership and has an international reach. In order for the hotlines to develop their full potential, it is necessary to ensure Europe-wide coverage and co-operation, and to increase effectiveness through exchange of information, best practice and experience. Community funds should also be used to raise public awareness of the hotlines, thereby making them more effective. 
Funding will be provided for hotlines, selected following a call for proposals, to act as nodes of the network and to co-operate with other nodes within the European network of hotlines. 
If necessary, telephone help lines could be supported, where children could raise concerns about illegal and harmful content on the Internet. 
For the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of hotlines, several indicators should be taken into account. Qualitative and quantitative data should be collected on the establishment and operation of hotlines, the number of national nodes, the geographical coverage in the Member States, the number of reports received, the number and level of experience of staff of the hotlines, the reports forwarded for action to the public authorities and ISPs, and, to the extent available, actions taken as a result, in particular the number and kind of web pages withdrawn by internet service providers as a result of information provided by the hotlines. Those data should be made public if possible and should be forwarded to the competent authorities. 
To ensure that the Programme is effective, hotlines are required in all Member States and candidate countries where none currently exists. These new hotlines must be incorporated quickly and effectively into the existing European network of hotlines. Incentives must be given to speed up the process of setting up hotlines. Links between this network and hotlines in third countries (particularly in other European countries where illegal content is hosted and produced) should be promoted, enabling the development of common approaches and transfer of know-how and best practice. In accordance with national legislation, and here appropriate and necessary, mechanisms for co-operation between civilian hotlines and law enforcement authorities must be further improved, including, for example, the development of codes of conduct for such hotlines. Where appropriate, there may be a need for legal and technical training of hotline staff. Active participation by hotlines in networking and cross-border activities will be mandatory. 
Hotlines should be linked to Member State initiatives, supported at national level and should be financially viable to ensure continued operation beyond the duration of this Programme. Co-funding is intended for civilian hotlines and therefore will not be provided for hotlines run by the police. Hotlines will make clear to users the difference between their activities and those of public authorities, and will inform them of the existence of alternative ways of reporting illegal content. 
In order to achieve maximum impact and effectiveness with available funding, the hotline network must operate as efficiently as possible. This can be best achieved by assigning a co-ordinating node to the network, which will facilitate agreement between the hotlines so as to develop European-level guidelines, working methods and practices which respect the limits of the national laws applying to the individual hotlines. 
The co-ordinating node will: 
- promote the network as a whole, so as to generate its European-level visibility and raise public awareness thereof throughout the European Union, providing e.g.. a single identity and entry point providing simple access to the appropriate national contact; 
- take contact with appropriate bodies with a view to completing the network's coverage in the Member States and candidate countries; 
- improve the operational effectiveness of the network; 
- draw up best practice guidelines for hotlines and adapt them to new technology; 
- organise regular exchange of information and experience between hotlines; 
- provide a pool of expertise for advice and a coaching process for start-up hotlines, particularly in candidate countries; 
- ensure liaison with hotlines in third countries; 
- maintain a close working relationship with the awareness co-ordinating node (see point 4 below) to ensure the cohesion and effectiveness of overall Programme operations and so as to increase public awareness of the hotlines; 
- participate in the Safer Internet Forum and other relevant events, co-ordinating input/feedback from hotlines. 
The co-ordinating node will monitor effectiveness of hotlines and collect accurate and meaningful statistics on their operation (number and type of reports received, action taken and result etc.). These statistics should be comparable across Member States. 
The hotline network should ensure coverage and exchange of reports of the major types of illegal content of concern — extending beyond the area of child pornography. Different mechanisms and expertise may be required to deal with other areas such as racist content, which might involve other types of nodes dealing with the different issues. Since the financial and administrative resources of the Programme are limited, not all such nodes would necessarily receive funding, which might have to be concentrated on a reinforced role for the co-ordinating node in these areas. 
2. Action 2: Tackling unwanted and harmful content 
In addition to action to fight illegal content at its source, users — responsible adults in the case of minors — may need technical tools. Accessibility to these tools may be promoted in order to empower users to make their own decisions on how to deal with unwanted and harmful content (user empowerment). 
Further funding should be provided to increase the information available about performance and effectiveness of filtering software and services so that the user can exercise that choice. User organisations and scientific research institutes can be valuable partners in this effort. 
Rating systems and quality labels, in combination with filtering technologies, can help to empower users to select the content they wish to receive and provide European parents and educators with the necessary information to make decisions in accordance with their cultural and linguistic values. Taking account of the results of previous projects, funding could be given to projects which aim to adapt rating systems and quality labels to take account of the convergence of telecommunications, audio-visual media and information technology and to self-regulatory initiatives to back-up the reliability of self-labelling and services to audit the accuracy of self-rating labels. Further work may be also be needed to encourage take-up of rating systems and quality labels by content providers. 
It would be desirable to try to take account of the possible effect of new technologies on their safe use by children when they are being developed, instead of trying to deal with any consequences of the new technologies after they have been devised. The safety of the end-user is a criterion to be taken into account along with technical and commercial considerations. One way of doing this would be to foster an exchange of views between child welfare specialists and technical experts. However, it should be taken into account that not every product developed for the online world is intended for use by children. 
The Programme will therefore provide funding for technological measures which meet the needs of users and which empower them to limit the amount of unwanted and harmful content which they receive, and to manage unwanted spam that they receive, including: 
- assessing the effectiveness of available filtering technology and providing this information to the public in a clear, simple way that facilitates comparison; 
- facilitating and co-ordinating exchanges of information and best practices on effective enforcement against unwanted and harmful content; 
- measures to increase take-up of content rating and quality site labels by content providers and to adapt content rating and labels to take account of the availability of the same content through different delivery mechanisms (convergence); 
- if necessary, contributing to the accessibility of filter technology notably in languages not adequately covered by the market. Where appropriate, the technologies used should safeguard the right to privacy pursuant to Directives 95/46/EC [1] and 2002/58/EC. 
The use of privacy-enhancing technological measures will be encouraged. Activities under this action will take fully into account the provisions of the forthcoming Council Framework decision on attacks against information systems. 
Implementation of this action will be closely co-ordinated with the actions on promoting a safer environment (self-regulatory action) and awareness-raising (informing the public about means of dealing with unwanted and harmful content). 
3. Action 3: Promoting a safer environment 
A fully functioning system of self-regulation is an essential element in limiting the flow of harmful and illegal content. Self-regulation involves a number of components: consultation and appropriate representation of the parties concerned; codes of conduct; national bodies facilitating co-operation at Community level; national evaluation of self-regulation frameworks [2]. There is a continuing need for Community work in this area to encourage implementation of codes of conduct by the European Internet and new online technologies industries. 
The Safer Internet Forum to be developed in 2004 under the current Safer Internet Action Plan is to become a discussion forum including representatives of industry, law enforcement authorities, policy makers, user organisations (e.g. parent and teacher organisations, child protection groups, consumer protection bodies, civil and digital rights organisations). It will provide a platform for national co-regulatory or self-regulatory bodies to exchange experience. It will also give the opportunity to discuss ways in which industry can contribute to the fight against illegal content. 
The Safer Internet Forum will provide a focal point for discussion at expert level and a platform to drive consensus, inputting conclusions, recommendations, guidelines etc. to relevant national and European channels. 
The Forum will span all action lines, facilitating discussion and stimulating action relevant to illegal, unwanted and harmful content. Consisting of plenary sessions and, where necessary for specific issues, of working groups with clear objectives and deadlines, it will be a meeting place for actors from all areas — including government agencies and programmes, standards bodies, industry, other services within the European Commission, user organisations (e.g. parent and teacher associations, child protection groups, consumer protection bodies and civil and digital rights organisations). The Forum will provide an opportunity for people active at national and European level, especially those involved in Member State programmes and initiatives, to exchange views, information and experience. Where appropriate, the Safer Internet Forum should exchange information and cooperate with relevant organisations active in related areas, such as in network and information security. 
The Safer Internet Forum will have the specific objectives of: 
1. Stimulating networking of the appropriate structures within Member States and developing links with self-regulatory bodies outside Europe. 
2. Stimulating consensus and self-regulation on issues such as quality rating of web-sites, cross-media content rating, rating and filtering techniques, extending them to new forms of content such as online games and new forms of access such as mobile phones. 
3. Encouraging service providers to draw up codes of conduct on issues such as handling Notice and Take Down procedures in a transparent and conscientious manner, information to users about safer use of Internet and the existence of hotlines for reporting illegal content. 
4. Promoting research into the effectiveness of rating projects and filtering technologies. User organisations and scientific research institutes can be valuable partners in this effort. 
Results and findings from ongoing and completed projects co-funded by the Programme will feed into the process. By providing an open platform, it will help to raise levels of awareness and attract the involvement of the candidate states and other countries outside the EU, providing an international arena to address a global problem. The Forum will, therefore, ensure that key associations, such as user organisations (e.g. parent and teacher organisations, child protection groups, consumer protection bodies, civil and digital rights organisations), industries and public bodies are aware of, are consulted on and contribute to safer use initiatives within the EU and internationally. 
The Safer Internet Forum will be open to participation of interested parties from outside the EU and candidate countries. International co-operation will be enhanced by a round table linked to the Forum in order to ensure regular dialogue on best practice, codes of conduct, self-regulation and quality ratings. The Commission will ensure that synergies with related fora and similar initiatives are fully exploited. 
A call for tenders may be organised in order to provide a secretariat to support the Safer Internet Forum including subject-field experts to suggest themes of study, prepare working papers, moderate discussions and record conclusions. 
A further type of activity attracting financial support at EU level could for instance include self-regulatory projects to design cross-border Codes of Conduct. Advice and assistance may be provided so as to ensure co-operation at Community level through networking of the appropriate bodies within Member States and candidate countries and through systematic review and reporting of relevant legal and regulatory issues, to help develop methods of assessment and certification of self-regulation, to provide practical assistance to countries wishing to set up self-regulatory bodies and to expand links with self-regulatory bodies outside Europe. 
4. Action 4: Awareness-raising 
Awareness actions should address a range of categories of illegal, unwanted and harmful content (including e.g. content considered unsuitable for children, racism and (xenophobia) and, where appropriate, take into account related issues of consumer protection, data protection, information and network security issues (viruses/spam). They should deal with content distributed over the World Wide Web as well as new forms of interactive information and communication brought about by the rapid deployment of the Internet and mobile telephony (e.g. peer-to-peer services, broadband video, instant messaging, chat-rooms, etc.). 
The Commission will continue to take steps to encourage cost-effective means of distribution of information to large numbers of users, notably by using multiplier organisations and electronic dissemination channels so as to reach the intended target groups. The Commission could consider in particular the use of mass media and the distribution of information material to schools and to Internet Cafés. 
The Programme will provide support to appropriate bodies which will be selected following an open call for proposals to act as awareness nodes in each Member State and in each candidate country and which will carry out awareness actions and programmes in close co-operation with all relevant actors at national, regional and local levels. European added value will be provided by a co-ordinating node. This will operate in close liaison with nodes to ensure that there is an exchange of best practice. 
Bodies seeking to act as awareness nodes will need to show that they have the strong support of national authorities. They should have a clear mandate to educate the public in safer use of the Internet and new media or in media and information literacy, and must have the necessary financial resources to implement that mandate. 
Awareness nodes will be expected to: 
- devise a cohesive, hard-hitting and targeted awareness campaign using the most appropriate media, taking into account best practice and experience in other countries; 
- establish and maintain a partnership (formal or informal) with key players (government agencies, press and media groups, ISP associations, user organisations, education stakeholders) and actions in their country relating to safer use of Internet and new media; 
- promote dialogue and exchange of information notably between stakeholders from the education and technological fields; 
- where appropriate, co-operate with work in areas related to the Safer Internet plus Programme such as in the wider fields of media and information literacy or consumer protection; 
- inform users about European filtering software and services and about hotlines and self-regulation schemes; 
- actively co-operate with other national nodes in the European network by exchanging information about best practices, participating in meetings and designing and implementing a European approach, adapted as necessary for national linguistic and cultural preferences; 
- provide a pool of expertise and technical assistance to start-up awareness nodes (new nodes could be "adopted" by a more experienced node). 
To ensure maximum co-operation and effectiveness, a co-ordinating node will be funded to provide logistical and infrastructural support for nodes in each Member State, ensuring European-level visibility, good communication and exchange of experience so that lessons learnt can be applied on an ongoing basis (for instance by adapting awareness material). 
The co-ordinating node should: 
- provide effective communication and exchange of information and best practice within the network; 
- provide training in safer use of Internet and new technologies for awareness node staff (training for trainers); 
- provide technical assistance to candidate countries wishing to set up awareness actions; 
- co-ordinate awareness nodes' provision of expertise and technical assistance to start-up awareness nodes; 
- propose indicators and manage collection, analysis and exchange of statistical information about awareness-raising activities so as to assess their impact; 
- provide infrastructure for a single, comprehensive trans-national repository (web portal) of relevant information and awareness and research resources with localised content (or local sub-sites as appropriate) which may include news snippets, articles, monthly newsletter in several languages as well as providing visibility for Forum activities; 
- expand links with awareness activities outside Europe; 
- participate in Safer Internet Forum and other relevant events, co-ordinating input/feedback from awareness network. 
Research will also be carried out on a comparable basis into the way people, especially children, use new media. Further action at EU level could for instance include support for specific child-friendly Internet services or an award for the best awareness activity of the year.
