Parties

Defendant(s): Portuguese Republic 
The applicant claims that the Court should:

- order the Portuguese Republic to pay the costs. 
Pleas in law and main arguments 
According to the Commission, the draft law on the non-contractual civil liability of the State and other public bodies put before the Assembly of the Republic by the Portuguese Government does not provide the measures necessary to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of 14 October 2004 in Case C-275/03 Commission 
v Portuguese Republic; no other measures whatsoever to comply with that judgment having been communicated to it, the Commission takes the view that the Portuguese Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 228(1) EC.
