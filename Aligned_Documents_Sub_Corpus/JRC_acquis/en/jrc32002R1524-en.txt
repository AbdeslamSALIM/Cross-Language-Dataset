amending Regulation (EC) No 936/97 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas for high-quality fresh, chilled and frozen beef and for frozen buffalo meat 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2345/2001(2), and in particular Article 32(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1149/2002 of 27 June 2002 opening an autonomous quota for imports of high-quality beef(3) provides for the opening of an annual import tariff quota of 1000 tonnes of high-quality beef starting on 1 July 2002. 
(2) Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1150/2002 of 27 June 2002 opening an autonomous quota for imports of high-quality beef(4) provides for the opening of an annual import tariff quota of 10000 tonnes of high-quality beef for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003. 
(3) Under Article 2 of the above Regulations the quotas in question are managed by means of certificates of authenticity. 
(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 936/97 of 27 May 1997 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas for high-quality fresh, chilled and frozen beef and for frozen buffalo meat(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 361/2002(6), provides, for a number of quotas of high-quality beef, for management by means of certificates of authenticity. In order to ensure the uniform management of the quotas in question, detailed rules should be adopted for the application of the above two quotas and incorporated into Regulation (EC) No 936/97. 
(5) Under Article 2(f) of Regulation (EC) No 936/97 the meat in question must meet certain quality criteria. In this context, the Canadian competent authority has just defined the grades of carcases for bison meat. The above Article 2(f) should therefore be amended. 
(6) In a number of cases, in particular when high-quality fresh or chilled beef is imported by air in view of its perishable nature, the documents and/or data required for the rapid release for free circulation of these goods are missing. In order to facilitate commercial operations, Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 936/97 should be amended. The exceptional cases in which import licences may be issued should first be specified. The conditions must be laid down for the lodging and release of a specific security against import licences other than those referred to in the second indent of Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2492/2001(8), and the main requirement for that guarantee must be defined. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,
