Whereas the braking test can be improved by replacing mean deceleration by a formula defining the braking distance as a function of speed; whereas that amendment will be followed by other changes aimed at improving the safety of tractors and the components involved in their use; 
Whereas the provisions of this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Directive 74/150/EEC,

- prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of tractors, 
on grounds relating to braking devices, if the tractors comply with the requirements of Directive 76/432/EEC as amended by this Directive. 
2. With effect from 1 March 1998 Member States: 
- shall no longer grant EC type-approval or issue the document referred to in the last indent of Article 10 (1) of Directive 74/150/EEC, and

Directive 76/432/EEC is amended as follows: 
'1. In Annex I, item 4.2.6, at the end of the first subparagraph, the following sentence is added: 
%quot%When more than one axle is normally subject to braking, one axle may be decoupled provided that activation of the service brake automatically recouples this axle and that, if the recoupling device fails, this is done automatically.%quot% 
2. In Annex II, item 1.1.1, the first sentence is replaced by the following: %quot%The effectiveness of a service brake is based on the braking distance calculated according to the formula set out in 2.1.1.1%quot%, 
item 1.2.2.2 is deleted, 
item 2.1.1.1 is amended to read: 
%quot%2.1.1.1. Under type O test conditions, achieve a stopping distance which is calculated as follows: 
Smax %amp%le;0,15 V + %gt%NUM%gt%VÂ˛ %gt%DEN%gt%116 
where 
V is the maximum design speed in km/h, and 
Smax is the maximum stopping distance in metres%quot%.`
