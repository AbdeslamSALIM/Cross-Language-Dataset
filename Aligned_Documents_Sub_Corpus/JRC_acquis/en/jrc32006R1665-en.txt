THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption [1], and in particular Article 16 thereof, 
Whereas:

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2075/2005 of 5 December 2005 laying down specific rules on official controls for Trichinella in meat [2] generally does not allow meat of domestic swine to leave slaughterhouses before the results of examination for Trichinella infestation have been communicated to the official veterinarian.

Under such circumstances it is essential that the competent authority verifies that full traceability of the released meat is in place at all times. 
(3) Regulation (EC) No 2075/2005 should, therefore, be amended accordingly 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
