CONTENTS

1. INTRODUCTION 
The graphic manual is an instrument for the operators to reproduce the logo. 
2. GENERAL USE OF THE LOGO 
2.1. COLOURED LOGO (reference colours) 
When the coloured logo is used, this logo must appear in colour by using direct colours (Pantone) or a four-colour process. The reference colours are indicated hereunder. 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000048EN.000801.EPS%quot%%gt% 
2.2. SINGLE-COLOUR LOGO: LOGO IN BLACK AND WHITE 
The logo in black and white can be used as shown: 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000048EN.000901.EPS%quot%%gt% 
2.3. CONTRAST WITH BACKGROUND COLOURS 
If the logo is used in colour on coloured backgrounds which makes it difficult to read, use a delimiting outer circle around the logo to improve its contrast with the background colours as shown: 
LOGO IN COLOURED BACKGROUND 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000048EN.001001.EPS%quot%%gt% 
2.4. TYPOGRAPHY 
Use Frutiger bold condensed in capitals for the wording. The letter size of the wording shall be reduced according to the norms set down in Section 2.6. 
2.5. LANGUAGE 
You are free to use the language version or versions of your choice according to the specifications indicated in B.3. 
2.6. REDUCTION SIZES 
If the application of the logo on different types of labelling makes reduction necessary, the minimum size shall be: 
(a) For a logo with a single indication: minimum size 20 mm diameter. 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000048EN.001101.EPS%quot%%gt% 
(b) For a logo with a combination of two indications: minimum size 40 mm diameter. 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000048EN.001102.EPS%quot%%gt% 
2.7. PARTICULAR CONDITIONS TO USE THE LOGO 
The use of the logo serves to confer specific value to the products. The most effective application of the logo is therefore in colour, since it will thus have a greater presence and be recognised more easily and quickly by the consumer. 
The use of the logo using a single colour (black and white) as established in Section 2.2 is only recommended in cases where its application in colour is not practical.
