Commission Directive 2005/46/EC of 8 July 2005 amending the Annexes to Council Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC as regards maximum residue levels for amitraz (Text with EEA relevance) 
Commission Directive 2005/46/EC 
of 8 July 2005 
amending the Annexes to Council Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC as regards maximum residue levels for amitraz 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals [1] and in particular Article 10 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin [2] and in particular Article 10 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables [3] and in particular Article 7 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) For the existing active substance amitraz a decision was taken not to include it in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC [4] by Commission Decision 2004/141/EC [5]. This Decision provides that plant protection products containing this active substance shall no longer be authorised for use in the Community except for a limited number of uses, where at the moment no alternatives are available (essential uses). 
(2) Decision 2004/141/EC allowed a phasing out period, and it is appropriate that maximum residue levels (MRLs) premised on the notion that use of the substance concerned is not authorised in the Community, should not apply until the end of the phasing out period applying to that substance. 
(3) For amitraz MRLs for residues resulting from veterinary medicinal uses have been set on animal products in the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 2377/90 [6]. It is appropriate to take these into account in this Directive. 
(4) Community MRLs and the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius [7] are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. There are a limited number of Codex MRLs for amitraz. These have been considered in the setting of the MRLs fixed in this Directive. Codex MRLs that will be recommended for withdrawal in the near future were not taken into account. The MRLs based on Codex MRLs having been evaluated in the light of the risks for the consumers, no risk was established. 
(5) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues resulting from unauthorised uses of plant protection products, MRLs should be set for the relevant product/pesticide combinations at the lower limit of analytical determination. 
(6) It is therefore necessary to amend several of the pesticide residues arising from use of amitraz in the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer. 
(7) The relevant annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
