COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 251 (2) of the EC Treaty concerning the 
common position of the Council on the adoption of a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008) 
1. BACKGROUND 
Date of transmission of the proposal to the EP and the Council (document COM(2005) 467 final Ã¢&#x20AC;&#x201C; 2005/0203(COD)): | 6 October 2005 | 
Date of the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee: | 20 April 2006 | 
Date of the opinion of the European Committee of the Regions: | 27 April 2006 | 
Date of the opinion of the European Parliament, first reading: | 1 June 2006 | 
Date of the revised proposal of the Commission (document COM(2006) 492 final): | 5 September 2006 | 
Date of adoption of the common position: | 13 November 2006 | 
2. OBJECTIVE OF THE COMMISSION PROPOSAL 
Based on Treaty Article 151, the proposal is to declare 2008 to be the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. 
Intercultural dialogue is intimately linked to the fundamental ambition underlying the construction of Europe, namely to bring together the peoples of Europe. It should therefore be a priority throughout the EU to call upon European citizens, and all those living in the European Union, to play a full part in managing our diversity, which is enriched by all new migration flows, greater mobility as well as by the changes and additions brought about by globalisation. 
Moreover, intercultural dialogue is an instrument which could facilitate the implementation of a series of strategic priorities for the Union. 
A European Year devoted to intercultural dialogue constitutes a unique awareness-raising tool for affirming this priority and involving citizens. It is intended to provide momentum to what should be a long-lasting, sustainable process. 
3. COMMENTS ON THE COMMON POSITION 
The common position adopted by the Council on 13 November 2006 by unanimity is the result of negotiations between the three institutions and represents a compromise acceptable for all of them. In comparison with the amended proposal of the Commission, which itself accepted a large number of amendments voted by the European Parliament in first reading, the changes are minor and are of technical and linguistic character. 
4. CONCLUSION 
The Commission considers that the common position adopted on 13 November 2006 by unanimity is appropriate and it can therefore support it.
