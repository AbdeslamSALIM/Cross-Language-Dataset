Directive 2006/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on minimum conditions for the implementation of Council Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85 concerning social legislation relating to road transport activities and repealing Council Directive 88/599/EEC (Text with EEA relevance) - Declarations 
Directive 2006/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 15 March 2006 
on minimum conditions for the implementation of 
Council Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85 
concerning social legislation relating to road transport activities and repealing Council Directive 88/599/EEC 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 71(1) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1], 
After consulting the Committee of the Regions, 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2], in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 8 December 2005, 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 of 20 December 1985 on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport [3] and (EEC) No 3821/85 of 20 December 1985 on recording equipment in road transport [4] and Directive 2002/15/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 11 March 2002 on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities [5] are important for the creation of a common market for inland transport services, for road safety and for working conditions. 
(2) In its White Paper "European transport policy for 2010: time to decide", the Commission indicated the need to tighten up checks and sanctions particularly for social legislation on road transport activities, and specifically to increase the number of checks, to encourage the systematic exchange of information between Member States, to coordinate inspection activities and to promote the training of enforcement officers. 
(3) It is therefore necessary to ensure proper application and harmonised interpretation of the social rules on road transport through the establishment of minimum requirements for the uniform and effective checking by the Member States of compliance with the relevant provisions. Those checks should serve to reduce and prevent infringements. Furthermore, a mechanism should be introduced which ensures that undertakings with a high risk rating are checked more closely and more often. 
(4) The risks arising from driver fatigue should also be addressed through enforcement of Directive 2002/15/EC. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Directive should not only lead to greater road safety but should also contribute to a harmonisation of working conditions in the Community and promote a level playing field. 
(6) The replacement of analogue tachographs by digital tachographs will progressively enable a greater volume of data to be checked more swiftly and more precisely and, for that reason, Member States will be increasingly able to undertake more checks. In terms of checks, the percentage of days worked by drivers of vehicles falling within the scope of the social legislation that are checked should therefore be gradually increased to 4 %. 
(7) As regards checking systems, the aim must be that national systems develop towards European interoperability and practicability. 
(8) Sufficient standard equipment and appropriate legal powers should be available to all enforcement units to enable them to carry out their duties effectively and efficiently. 
(9) Member States should seek to ensure, without prejudice to the proper execution of the tasks imposed by this Directive, that roadside checks are executed efficiently and quickly, with a view to completing the check in the shortest time possible and with the least delay for the driver. 
(10) Within each Member State there should be a single body for intracommunity liaison with other relevant competent authorities. That body should also compile relevant statistics. Member States should also apply a coherent national enforcement strategy on their territory and may designate a single body to coordinate its implementation. 
(11) Cooperation between Member State enforcement authorities should be further promoted through concerted checks, joint training initiatives, the electronic exchange of information, and the exchange of intelligence and experience. 
(12) Best practice in road transport enforcement operations, particularly to ensure a harmonised approach to the issue of proof of a driver's annual leave or sick leave, should be facilitated and promoted through a forum for Member State enforcement authorities. 
(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [6]. 
(14) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to lay down clear, common rules on minimum conditions for checking the correct and uniform implementation of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85 and Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 of 15 March 2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport and amending Council Regulations (EEC) No 3821/85 and (EC) No 2135/98 and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 [7], cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, by reason of the need for coordinated transnational action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. 
(15) Council Directive 88/599/EEC [8] on standard checking procedures for the implementation of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85should therefore be repealed, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
Subject-matter 
This Directive lays down minimum conditions for the implementation of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85. 
Article 2 
Checking systems 
1. Member States shall organise a system of appropriate and regular checks on correct and consistent implementation, as referred to in Article 1, both at the roadside and at premises of undertakings of all transport categories. 
These checks shall cover each year a large and representative cross-section of mobile workers, drivers, undertakings and vehicles of all transport categories falling within the scope of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85. 
Member States shall ensure that a coherent national enforcement strategy is applied on their territory. For this purpose, Member States may designate a body for the coordination of actions taken under Articles 4 and 6, in which case the Commission and the other Member States shall be informed thereof. 
2. In so far as this is not already the case, Member States shall, not later than 1 May 2007, provide authorised inspecting officers with appropriate legal powers to enable them correctly to discharge their inspection obligations as required by this Directive. 
3. Each Member State shall organise checks in such a way that, as from 1 May 2006, 1 % of days worked by drivers of vehicles falling within the scope of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85 are checked. This percentage will increase to at least 2 % from 1 January 2008 and to at least 3 % from 1 January 2010. 
From 1 January 2012 this minimum percentage may be increased to 4 % by the Commission, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), provided that the statistics collected pursuant to Article 3 show that, on average, more than 90 % of all vehicles checked are equipped with a digital tachograph. In making its decision, the Commission shall also take into account the effectiveness of existing enforcement measures, in particular the availability of digital tachograph data at the premises of undertakings. 
Not less than 15 % of the total number of the working days checked shall be checked at the roadside and not less than 30 % at the premises of undertakings. From 1 January 2008 not less than 30 % of the total number of the working days checked shall be checked at the roadside and not less than 50 % shall be checked at the premises of undertakings. 
4. The information submitted to the Commission in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 shall include the number of drivers checked at the roadside, the number of checks at the premises of undertakings, the number of working days checked and the number and type of infringements reported, together with a record of whether passengers or goods were transported. 
Article 3 
Statistics 
Member States shall ensure that statistics collected from the checks organised in accordance with Article 2(1) and (3) are broken down into the following categories: 
(a) for roadside checks: 
(i) type of road, namely whether it is a motorway, a national or a secondary road, and country of registration of the vehicle inspected, in order to avoid discrimination; 
(ii) type of tachograph: analogue or digital; 
(b) for checks at the premises: 
(i) type of transport activity, namely whether the activity is international or domestic, passenger or freight, own account or for hire or reward; 
(ii) size of company fleet; 
(iii) type of tachograph: analogue or digital. 
These statistics shall be submitted biennially to the Commission and shall be published in a report. 
The competent authorities in the Member States shall keep a record of the data collected for the previous year. 
Undertakings responsible for drivers shall keep, for a period of one year, the documents, records of results and other relevant data passed to them by the enforcement authorities concerning checks carried out on them at their premises and/or on their drivers at the roadside. 
Any further clarification required of the definitions of the categories mentioned under (a) and (b) shall be established by the Commission, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2). 
Article 4 
Roadside checks 
1. Roadside checks shall be organised in various places and at any time and shall cover a sufficiently extensive part of the road network to make it difficult to avoid checkpoints. 
2. Member States shall ensure that: 
(a) sufficient provision is made for checkpoints on or nearby existing and planned roads and, if necessary, that service stations and other safe locations along motorways can function as checkpoints; 
(b) checks are carried out following a random rotation system, with an appropriate geographical balance. 
3. The points to be verified at roadside checks are set out in Part A of Annex I. Checks may focus on a specific point if the situation so requires. 
4. Without prejudice to Article 9(2), roadside checks shall be carried out without discrimination. In particular, enforcement officers shall not discriminate on any of the following grounds: 
(a) country of registration of vehicle; 
(b) country of residence of driver; 
(c) country of establishment of undertaking; 
(d) origin and destination of journey; 
(e) type of tachograph: analogue or digital. 
5. Enforcement officers shall be provided with: 
(a) a list of the principal points to be checked, as set out in Part A of Annex I; 
(b) standard checking equipment, as set out in Annex II. 
6. If, in a Member State, the findings of a roadside check on the driver of a vehicle registered in another Member State afford grounds for believing that infringements have been committed which cannot be established during the check owing to a lack of necessary data, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall assist each other in clarifying the situation. 
Article 5 
Concerted checks 
Member States shall, at least six times per year, undertake concerted roadside checks on drivers and vehicles falling within the scope of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85. Such checks shall be undertaken at the same time by the enforcement authorities of two or more Member States, each operating in its own territory. 
Article 6 
Checks at the premises of undertakings 
1. Checks at premises shall be planned in the light of past experience in relation to the various types of transport and undertakings. They shall also be carried out if serious infringements of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 or (EEC) No 3821/85 have been detected at the roadside. 
2. Checks at premises shall cover the points listed in Part A and Part B of Annex I. 
3. Enforcement officers shall be provided with: 
(a) a list of the principal points to be checked, as set out in Parts A and B of Annex I; 
(b) standard checking equipment, as set out in Annex II. 
4. Enforcement officers in a Member State shall, in the course of the check take into account any information provided by the designated liaison body of another Member State, as referred to in Article 7(1), concerning the activities of the undertaking in question in that other Member State. 
5. For the purposes of paragraphs 1 to 4, checks carried out at the premises of the competent authorities, on the basis of relevant documents or data handed over by undertakings at the request of the said authorities, shall have the same status as checks carried out at the premises of undertakings. 
Article 7 
Intracommunity liaison 
1. Member States shall designate a body which shall have the following tasks: 
(a) to ensure coordination with equivalent bodies in the other Member States concerned as regards actions taken under Article 5; 
(b) to forward the biennial statistical returns to the Commission under Article 16(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85; 
(c) to be primarily responsible for assisting the competent authorities of other Member States pursuant to Article 4(6). 
The body shall be represented on the Committee referred to in Article 12(1). 
2. Member States shall notify the Commission of the designation of this body and the Commission shall advise the other Member States accordingly. 
3. The exchange of data, of experience and of intelligence between Member States shall be actively promoted, primarily but not exclusively through the Committee referred to in Article 12(1) and any such body as the Commission may designate in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2). 
Article 8 
Exchange of information 
1. Information made available bilaterally under Article 17(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 or Article 19(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 shall be exchanged between the designated bodies notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 7(2): 
(a) at least once every six months after the entry into force of this Directive; 
(b) upon specific request by a Member State in individual cases. 
2. Member States shall seek to establish systems for the electronic exchange of information. In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), the Commission shall define a common methodology for effective information exchange. 
Article 9 
Risk rating system 
1. Member States shall introduce a risk rating system for undertakings based on the relative number and severity of any infringements of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 or (EEC) No 3821/85 that an individual undertaking has committed. The Commission shall support dialogue between Member States to encourage consistency between these risk rating systems. 
2. Undertakings with a high risk rating shall be checked more closely and more often. The criteria and detailed rules for implementing such a system shall be discussed in the Committee referred to in Article 12, with a view to establishing a system for the exchange of information on best practices. 
3. An initial list of infringements of Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85 is set out in Annex III. 
With a view to giving guidelines on the weighting of infringements of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85, the Commission may, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), adapt Annex III with a view to establishing guidelines on a common range of infringements, divided into categories according to their gravity. 
The category for the most serious infringements should include those where failure to comply with the relevant provisions of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85 create a serious risk of death or serious personal injury. 
Article 10 
Report
