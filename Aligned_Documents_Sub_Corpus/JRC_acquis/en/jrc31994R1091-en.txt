ANNEX I 
COMMON METHODS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NETWORK OF PERMANENT OBSERVATION PLOTS FOR INTENSIVE, CONTINUOUS MONITORING (Article 2 (1) to Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86 and its amendments) I. General remarks 
The purpose of the scheme mentioned in Article 2 (1) to Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86 and its amendments is to establish a network of permanent observation plots in the Member States of the Community and to collect data by intensive and continuous surveillance. 
The objectives of the scheme are: 
- to conduct an intensive and continuous monitoring of forest ecosystems in relation to the damage caused by atmospheric pollution and other factors influencing forest condition, 
- to improve the understanding of the causal relationship between changes in forest ecosystem and the factors influencing it, especially atmospheric pollution, by concentrating at a single location various measurements and monitoring of forest ecosystems and its component, 
- to obtain relevant information on the evolution of a number of forest ecosystems in the Community. 
II. Establishment of the network of permanent observation plots 
II.1. Selection of plots 
Member States shall select by 30 June 1994 at its latest a sufficiently large number of permanent observation plots in their country. The maximum number of these plots should in principle not exceed 20 % of the number of national plots of the Community's 16 x 16 km gridnet (Regulation EEC No 1696/87). Member States with a limited number of plots of the Community's gridnet, are allowed to select a larger number of permanent plots under the condition that the number shall be limited up to 15 plots. 
The selection of these plots are the responsibility of the Member States, although the following criteria for the selection should be applied: 
- the plots should be located in such a way that the more important forest species and more widespread growing conditions in the respective country are represented, 
- the minimum size of a plot shall be 0,25 hectares measured on a horizontal plane, 
- to minimize the effects from activities on surrounding areas the plot shall be surrounded by a buffer zone. The actual width of the zone is depending on the type and age of the forest. If the area of the plot and its surroundings is uniform with regard to height and age structure, the width of the buffer zone can be restricted to 5 or 10 m. If the forest area in which the plot is located consists of mixed stands, different species or age structure, the buffer zone shall be enlarged to up to five times the potential maximum height of the forest in the plot, 
- as the plot will have to be available for long duration monitoring, it is necessary that the corners and/or boundaries are clearly marked and that each sample tree in the plot is numbered in a permanent way, 
- the plots should be easily accessible at all times and no restrictions with regard to the access and sampling should exist, 
- there should be no differences in the management of the plot, its buffer zone and the surrounding forest (e. g. mangagement operations should be comparable and disturbances by the monitoring should be kept to a minimum), 
- direct pollution from known local sources should be avoided. Plots should not be located in the immediate surrounding of farms, very close to main roads or in the direct vicinity of polluting industries, 
- a sufficient number of trees should be available for sampling in or nearby the plot, 
- the plots and the buffer zone should be as uniform as possible regarding, e.g. species or species mixture, age size, soil and slope, 
- the plots should be located sufficiently far away from the forest edge. 
It is recommended to select plots which have been monitored during the last years within the framework of the Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86 or other programmes. When additional plots have to be selected it is recommended that plots are identical with or located nearby one of the existing plots of the Community's 16 x 16 km network and that plots are located in such a way that information from other sources (e.g. meteorological stations) can be used. 
II.2. Installation and documentation of the plot 
Member States shall install, preferably all, but at least over 50 % of the plots in a permanent way by 30 June 1994. In certain cases it could be acceptable that the actual installation of the last plots is delayed for one year. Each installed plot shall be described in detail. General data shall be determined and reported before 15 December 1994. The detailed description of the plot shall include: the exact location of the plot, a sketch map shall be prepared showing the permanent marking of the plot corners and/or boundaries, the number of trees in the plot and any other relevant permanent elements in or nearby the plot (e. g. access road, rivers). In the future, the exact location of sample sites (e.g. soil pits) shall be recorded on this map as well. 
II.3. Definition of a sub-plot 
In principle all trees in the total plot are to be included in the sample for the tree assessment (e.g. crown inventory, increment assessment). In the case that the plot has many trees (i.e. dense stands), a sub-plot may be defined to be used for these surveys. The size of the sub-plot at the time of the installation of the plot should be large enough to give reliable estimates for these surveys for a minimum of 20 years, preferably throughout the life of the stand. A minimum of at least 20 trees in the sub-plot should be available in this period. 
II.4. General information on each plot 
The following general information on each permanent observation plot for the intensive and continuous monitoring shall be collected during the installation and the first surveys: 
%quot%%quot%%quot% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%Country 
Observation plot number 
Actual latitude and longitude 
%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%Altitude

Main tree species 
Yield (estimate) 
%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%History of the plot 
Nearby situated other monitoring station 
%quot%%gt% 
By 15 December 1994, the Member States shall forward to the Commission for each installed plot the information collected during the installation using a datafile (see Annex VIIa, Form 1a) and reports (see Annex VIIa, Form 1b). Important information obtained during the years of monitoring shall be submitted yearly using the Forms 1a and 1b (Annex VII). The other information shall be submitted right after the first relevant survey has been carried out and will be updated when necessary. 
II.5. Replacement of permanent observation plots 
Permanent observation plots have to be available for long duration monitoring. In case of unforeseen events (e.g. destruction of trees in the plot by fire, storm) a replacement of this plot might be necessary. Member States shall forward to the Commission the basic information for the new plot as specified in this Annex.

ANNEX III 
COMMON METHODS FOR THE INVENTORY OF THE CROWN CONDITION ON THE PERMANENT OBSERVATION PLOTS I. General remarks 
The inventory shall be carried out on all permanent observation plots in 1994 and shall be repeated annually. 
II. Inventory methodology 
II.1. Selection of sample trees 
In principle all pre-dominant, dominant and co-dominant trees (Kraft: class 1 to 3) in the total plot are to be monitored. In the case that the plot has many trees (e.g. dense stands), the number of sample trees for the crown assessment could be reduced by using a sub-plot (see Annex I (II.3)). In the case of a sub-plot all the pre-dominant, dominant and co-dominant trees (Kraft: class 1 to 3) in the sub-plot are to be monitored. In certain cases it could be allowed that a different, but objective and unbiased system is used to reduce or to select the number of trees to be sampled. The same methods shall be applied every year and a minimum of 20 trees shall be assessed each survey. 
II.2. Date of assessment 
The inventory is to be undertaken between the end of the formation of new needles and leaves and before the autumnal leaf discolouration. 
II.3. General background information 
The following general information shall be collected: 
- plot number, 
- tree number, 
- tree species, 
- date of assessment. 
II.4. Assessment of sample trees 
1. Visual assessment of defoliation 
Defoliation shall be estimated in 5 % steps in relation to a tree with full foliage in local condition. The classification of trees into degrees of defoliation shall be carried out during the observation and shall be registered in 5 % steps. 
2. Visual assessment of discolouration 
The classification of trees into degrees of discolouration shall be carried out after the observations have been made. 
The degrees of discolouration are defined as follows: 
%quot%%quot% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%0 
%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%None or negligible%gt% ID=%quot%3%quot%%gt%0-10 
%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%1 
%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%Slight discolouration%gt% ID=%quot%3%quot%%gt%11-25 
%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%2 
%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%Moderate discolouration%gt% ID=%quot%3%quot%%gt%26-60 
%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%3 
%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%Severe discolouration%gt% ID=%quot%3%quot%%gt% %gt% 60 
%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%4 
%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%Dead%quot%%gt% 
3. Additional parameters 
The additional parameters are listed below: 
- damage due to easily identifiable causes (insect, fungi, abiotic agents...), 
- identification of damage type, 
- observations on the tree in the plot. 
II.5. Data transfer 
The Member States shall forward to the Commission on a yearly basis for each plot this information in standardized forms (see Annex VII, Form 3a and 3b). 
ANNEX IV 
COMMON METHODS FOR THE SOIL INVENTORY ON THE PERMANENT OBSERVATION PLOTS I. General remarks 
The inventory is to be carried out on all permanent observation plots in the period between 1994 and 1996. Soil condition data, which were collected and analysed before 1994, but after 1 January 1991 could also be used if the methods as described below have been applied. The inventory will be repeated on each individual sample plot every 10 years. This Annex is based on results of the soil expert panel of UN-ECE/ICP on assessment and monitoring of air pollution effects on forests (ICP forests). Reference is made to the manual (1992) prepared by this expert panel. After two sampling periods a review of the parameters to be analysed in future soil samples shall be made. 
II. Inventory methodology 
II.1. Selection of sample location 
Soil samples will be statistically representative for the situation of the plot. The soil samples will be collected from a profile pit and/or taken from bores. Care should be taken to avoid any disturbance of roots belonging to sample trees. 
II.2. General background information 
The following general information shall be collected: 
- plot number, 
- date of sampling and analysis. 
II.3. Pedological and physical characterization of the sample plots 
A pedological characterization shall be made for each sample plot. It is advised to make the profile description according to the FAO-guidelines (FAO guidelines for soil description, third edition (revised), Rome 1990) in the buffer zone. Care should be taken that the profile description(s) is/are made on a location which is representative for the actual sampling area. It is recommended that the dry bulk density is determined from undisturbed soil to enable the calculation of the total nutrient contents. If the dry bulk density is not determined, a reasonable estimate of this parameter should be made. The determination of the soil granulometry is mandatory. The particle size fractions are: %lt% 2 mm, 2-63 mm, 63-2000 mm (FAO). If 50 mm is used to separate silt and sand fractions, conversion to 63 mm limit has to be done. 
II.4. Method of sampling 
The soil samples shall be collected by depth or by horizon. For every sampled layer or horizon, at least one representative composite sample will be collected or several samples; the number of subsamples collected for the composite sample and the sampling date shall be reported. 
The organic layers (O- and H-) (1)() are sampled separately. In case the sampling is done by fixed depth, the following layers are to be used: 
- 0 - 10 cm (it is advised to sample 0 - 5 and 5 - 10 separately), 
- 10 - 20 cm, 
- 20 - 40 cm, 
- 40 - 80 cm. 
II.5. Transport storage and preparation 
The samples shall be transported and stored in such a way that chemical changes are minimized. The procedures of this transport and storage (including waiting periods) shall be reported. Where applicable the problems and deviations of these procedures shall be reported in detail. It is advised to store part of the sample in a soil bank for comparative use with future sampling (e. g in 10 years). Before the samples are analysed the samples have to be prepared. Large items (%gt% 2 mm) have to be removed, the samples have to be dried (at a maximum of 40 ¬∞C), and milled or sieved. 
II.6. Analysis methods 
In the 'Manual on methodologies of forest soil sampling and analysis' prepared by the soil expert panel of the ICP forests, the approved methods for the analysis of the various soil parameters are described. It is advised to use the approved methods. In case other (national) methods are applied, the comparability of the analysis results shall be reported in detail together with the presentation of the analysis results. The inventory of the forest soil condition will distinguish between mandatory and optional parameters (see list).

II.7. Data transfer 
The Member States shall forward to the Commission for each plot this information in a standardized form (see Annex VII, Form 4a, 4b, and 4c). 
(1)() The soil expert panel of the UN-ECE/ICP has agreed to use the definitions as given in the FAO-guidelines for soil description (1990), and the definitions of the organic layers (O- and H-) are as follows: 
H-horizons or layers: layers dominated by organic material, formed from accumulations of undecomposed or partially decomposed organic material at the soil surface which may be underwater. All H-horizons are saturated with water for prolonged periods or were once saturated but are now artificially drained. An H-horizon may be on the top of mineral soils or at any depth beneath the surface if it is buried. 
O-horizons or layers: layers dominated by organic material, consisting of undecomposed or partially decomposed litter, such as leaves, needles, twigs, moss and lichens, which has accumulated on the surface; they may be on top of either mineral or organic soils. O-horizons are not saturated with water for prolonged periods. The mineral fraction of such material is only a small percentage of the volume of the material and generally is much less than half of the weight. An O-layer may be at the surface of a soil or at any depth beneath the surface if it is buried. An horizon formed by illuviation of organic material into a mineral subsoil is not an O-horizon, though some horizons formed in this matter contain much organic matter. 
ANNEX V 
COMMON METHODS FOR THE FOLIAGE INVENTORY ON THE PERMANENT OBSERVATION PLOTS I. General remarks 
The inventory is to be carried out on all permanent observation plots. The first common inventory shall be completed before the summer of 1996. Although it is recommended to carry out the foliage inventory in the indicated periods of summer 1995 and winter 1995/96, it could be allowed that the inventory is split over two years. The inventory will be repeated on each individual plot in a two year interval. The following technical details are based on the results of the expert panel for foliar analysis of ICP forests. Reference is made to the manual (1993) prepared by this expert panel. 
II. Inventory methodology 
II.1. Date of sampling 
Deciduous species (including larch): sampling must be done when the new leaves are fully developed, and before the very beginning of the autumnal yellowing and senescence. Evergreen species: sampling must be done during the dormancy period. Member States are requested to define for each region, and inside each region for plains and mountains, the most convenient period for the sampling and analysis of the various species, and to keep to this period. 
II.2. Selection of trees 
Every second year, at least five trees of each main species present in the plot are sampled. 
The number of trees needed for the sampling are selected in such a way that: 
- the trees are different from those used for the crown assessment, in order to avoid that successive samplings introduce loss of foliage, 
- in case the vitality assessment is restricted to the trees in the sub-plot, the trees for the foliage sampling shall be selected from the remaining part of the total plot. If no sub-plot is used the trees for sampling shall be selected from the trees in the buffer zone. In this case the trees selected for sampling in the buffer zone shall be given a special number (see Annex VII), 
- the trees belong to the predominant and dominant classes (forest with closed canopy) or to the trees with average height ¬± 20 % (forest with open canopy), 
- the trees are in the vicinity of the locations where soil samples were taken for anaylsis; however care must be taken that the main roots of the sample trees have not been damaged by soil sampling, 
- the trees are representative of the mean defoliation level of the plot (¬± 5 % of the mean foliage loss), 
- the trees are representative of the sanitary status of the plot. 
The same sample trees shall be sampled over the years; the trees must be numbered. For species with small crowns and too few needles (or leaves) per year, it is allowed (but not recommended) to alternate between two sets of five trees, when necessry to avoid damage to the sample trees. Each set mut respond to the above conditions. 
Only trees of the main species of the Community are to be sampled (see Annex VII, item 15). 
Trees which are used for the sampling of foliage, shall be assessed on crown condition (see Annex III), using the existing or the specially assigned numbers. 
II.3. General background information 
The following information shall be collected: 
- plot number, 
- data of sampling and analysis; 
- tree species. 
II.4. Selection and quantity of leaves and needles 
The trees in the plot cannot be felled, which may influence the sampling method of leaves or needles. It is important that sampled leaves or needles have developed in full light. Generally speaking the current year needles or leaves of evergreen species are most convenient for judging the nutrition level but, for a number of elements, comparing element concentration in older needles with that in current year needles may be interesting. 
The sampled leaves or needles must be taken from the upper third of crown, but not from the very first whorls in the conifers; in stands where the different whorls can be clearly identified, it is advisable to sample between the seventh and the 15th whorl. 
For deciduous species, sampling is done on current year leaves or needles. 
For evergreen species, sampling of both the current year needles or leaves and the second year needles or leaves (current + 1) is recommended. 
For all species it is necessary to take care that leaves or needles which are sampled are mature ones, especially for species which have several flushes per year (e.g. Pinus Halepensis, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Eucalyptus sp. Quercus sp., For Larix sp. and Cedrus sp. samples are taken of the short twigs of the previous year. 
In general sampling must be carried out in such a way that all the orientations are represented in the set of sample trees. If necessary it is allowed to sample different orientations on each tree of the sample set. In special sites with evident influence of one orientation (e.g. steep slopes or strong dominant wind) only one orientation is sampled, which always has to be the same. In such cases, it is necessary to document the orientation. 
For the analysis of major elements and Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, the recommended quantity is 30 grams of fresh needles or leaves for each sampled age class. 
Each country may decide to sample a larger quantity of leaf material, according to the need of its own analytical methods, or in order to conserve samples for the future. 
II.5. Means of sampling 
As trees cannot be felled, any convenient way of sampling, taking into consideration kind and size of stands etc., is acceptable, provided that it does not lead to contamination of the sample, to heavy tree damage, or to risks for the sampling team. 
II.6. Pretreatment before sending the samples to the laboratories for analysis 
At least five trees of each main species present in the plot are sampled; the five samples are individually preserved in bags; for analysis, a composite sample is made by mixing equal quantities of each of the five samples (in case the five trees are analysed individually, the mean value is calculated for each element). 
For broadleaves, it may be advisable to detach the leaves from the twigs (and even, in certain species, the small leaves from the axis) bus this is not necessary for the conifer needles. The shoots of the current year and those of the second year are separated and preserved in separate bags. The use of pierced high density polyethylene bags is recommended. If possible, samples are dried in a clean room and stored in a cool place in pierced polyethylene bags. 
Great care must be taken to clearly mark each sample (forest, number of plot, species, age of needles, etc.) before sending it to the laboratory for analysis. These identifications must be given outside the bag (directly on the bag by indelible ink, or by clasping a label on the bag). It is recommended to repeat these identifications inside the bag on a paper label written with indelible ink. The label should be folded in order to avoid leaves or needle contamination by contact with ink. 
II.7. Treatment before analysis 
The determination of the mass of 100 leaves or 1 000 needles, as well as the shoot mass, are recommended for the intensive and continuous surveillance on the permanent observation plots and the current year shoot. 
It is not necessary to cut the petioles of the leaves but in case of compound leaves it may be advisable to detach the small leaves from the axis if this has not been done in the forest. To avoid contamination, no powdered plastic gloves shall be used. 
It is not necessry to systematically wash the samples, but it may be advisable in regions with a high level of air pollution or near the sea. The samples shall be washed with water without any additions. 
Oven drying must be done at no more than 80 ¬∞C for at least 24 hours. The needles shall be removed from the twigs with the same precautions as for detaching the small leaves from their axis. 
Dry samples shall be ground in order to obtain a fine powder, as homogeneous as possible. There will always remain some fibres, depending on the tree species; this is not a major inconvenience if they are small and if the powder is mixed carefully before taking samples for analysis. For Mn, Fe, Cu, Cd, Al and Pb determination, it has to be assured that the grinder does not contaminate the samples. The grinder may be tested by grinding dried fibrous cellulose and analysing it for these elements before and after the grinding. 
II.8. Chemical analyses 
Only the total element concentration is determined. 
In the 'Manual on methodologies for leaf and needle sampling and analyses' prepared by the foliar expert panel of the ICP forests, the indicative methods for the analysis of the various foliar parameters are described. 
Each country is allowed to use its national methods. But is is necessary to compare the total element concentrations obtained by national methods with those certified on the reference standard samples. The foliage inventory will distinguish between mandatory and optional parameters (see list below).

Member States are free to analyse more, all, or part of the optional parameters. 
II.9. Data transfer 
The Member States shall forward to the Commission for each plot this information in a standardized form (see Annex VII, Form 5a, 5b, and 5c). 
ANNEX VI 
COMMON METHODS FOR INCREMENT CHANGE MEASUREMENTS ON THE PERMANENT OBSERVATION PLOTS I. General remarks 
The first measurement is to be carried out on all permanent observation plots in the period 1994 until 1996. 
The measurement of the growth is divided into two parts: 
- periodic measurements on tree parameters, 
- tree ring analysis by means of increment cores and stem discs (optional). 
The periodic measurements will be repeated on each individual plot in the dormancy period 1999 to 2000 and will then be repeated in a five year interval. The sampling and analysis of increment cores and stem discs could be carried out once preferably during the installation or soon after. 
The following technical details are based on the results of the expert panel on increment of ICP forests. Reference is made to the manual prepared by this expert panel. 
The methodologies described here are inappropriate for maquis and similar vegetation types. 
II. Inventory methodology 
II.1. Date of measurements 
Measurements should be done during the dormancy period. 
II.2. Selection of sample trees 
In principle all trees in the total plot are to be monitored. In the case that the plot has many trees (e.g. dense stands), a sub-plot may have been defined to be used for the tree assessment (e.g. crown assessment and increment). In this case the trees in the sub-plot are to be monitored. The size of the sub-plot at the time of the inventory should be large enough to give reliable estimates for stand increment over the entire measurement period. The exact size of this sub-plot shall be determined and reported. 
II.3. Methods 
Periodic measurements 
Every five years, all trees in the (sub-)plot are measured. 
Tree ring analysis (increment cores and stem disc) 
As the sampling of increment cores could influence other measurements these samples are taken from trees outside the plot. As trees for stem disc sampling have to be felled, the trees selected have to be so far away from the plot that no effects of this removal can affect the monitored trees in the plot. At the same time the sample trees shall be representative to the trees in the plot. Whenever possible, maximum use shall be made of trees felled during normal management operations. 
II.4. General background information 
The following information shall be collected: 
- plot number, 
- data of sampling and analysis, 
- tree number.

Member States are free to analyse more, or part of the optional parameters. 
Member States are allowed to use their own national system and methods. Suggested methods and details on measurements procedures are described in the 'Submanual on increment' prepared by the increment panel of the ICP forests. 
II.6. Data transfer 
The Member States shall forward to the Commission for each plot this information in a standardized form (see Annex VII, Forms 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d). 
ANNEX VII 
COMMON GUIDELINES FOR THE REPORTING OF THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEILLANCE ON THE PERMANENT OBSERVATION PLOTS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION I. General remarks 
The purpose of the network of permanent observation plots is to obtain detailed data on the evolution of forest ecosystems in the Community and to try to correlate the variation of environmental factors, especially atmospheric pollution, and the reaction of the forest ecosystems. 
This purpose can only be reached by evaluating the results on the plot level. Comparison between the results of different permanent plots on regional or Community level will have to be done with great care. It is recommended that the validated data of each survey (or completed part) is submitted to the Commission as soon as the data become available, using the standardized forms in this Annex. 
Member States shall forward to the Commission the data collected from the different inventories carried out between 1991 and 1996 for each permanent plot together with an interpretation of the results per plot. By 31 December 1996, all data and the national interpretation shall be available at the Commission in a standardized form for further evaluation. 
The validated data from the inventories after 1996 will be forwarded to the Commission upon completion of the surveys, with new deadlines every five years (e.g. 31 December 2001, 2006, etc.). 
In this Annex the detail on the submission of the inventory results and their interpretation are presented. 
II. General technical information for the submission of data 
II.1. Hardware requirements 
As medium for the data submission, the 3,5%amp% Prime; floppy disk (DSDD or HD) has been selected. This floppy has become a worldwide standard and is cheap and durable. Diskettes of good quality are to be used. 
II.2. Software requirements 
The diskettes are to be formatted on the appropriate density (DSDD = low density and HD = high density), using DOS 2.1 or higher, and should be 100 % IBM compatible. All information on the diskette shall be in ASCII characters. 
II.3. Data files 
Each diskette (or set of diskettes) shall contain the plot and data files; the file with the summarized information of the plots (plot file), and file(s) with the inventoried results per survey (data files). Details on the names and the contents of these files are presented in Annex VIIa. 
II.4. Example on diskette 
On request a diskette with an example of the structure and contents of the files can be supplied. 
ANNEX VIIa 
SUBMISSION OF DATA PER PERMANENT PLOT IN A DIGITAL FORMAT I. Review of file names per survey 
In the Annexes before, the details have been desribed of the inventory methods. After assessment, sampling/analysis, validation and evaluation, the data are to be submitted to the Commission in a standardized form. In this Annex the standardized form for each assessment is defined. 
For each assessment the validated data are to be presented in one or more files with a standard format.

M48 = Mineral soil between 40 and 80 cm (mandatory) 
(22) Code of sampling analysis method (SAM) 
For each parameter that has been determined in one or more soil samples, one of the following codes is included in the first dataline, and used to indicate the sample type under sample code: 
0 = no deviation from approved method 
1 = parameters have been determined through an alternative method (details to be included in an annex to the soil condition report), or first (sub)sample 
2-8 = codes to be used for any subsequent subsamples 
9 = parameters have been determined through recomputation of data determined through a different method (details to be included in the annex to the soil condition report) 
to be used in the foliage inventory 
(23) Sample code 
The sample code for the foliage inventory consists of the tree species code (see explanation item 15) followed by the code for leaves/needles of the current year (=0) or of the current + 1 leaves/needles (1). e.g. the sample of the needles of last year (1) of the Picea abies (118) is thus: 118.1 
(24) Tree numbers of the sample 
As in some samplings (foliage, increment) trees outside the normal plot (or sub-plot) have to be used, special numbers have to be applied. The numbers of these trees will start with a letter (F = foliage, R = ring analysis by increment borings, D = discs analysis) followed with a sequence number (e.g. F001). The numbers are to be reported. 
(25) Mass of 100 leaves or 1 000 needles 
The mass is determined of 100 leaves or 1 000 needles (oven-dry) in grams.

to be used in the increment assessment 
(27) Diameter at breast height (DBH) 
The diameter at breast height (1,30 m) over bark in 0,1 centimetres. 
When a diameter tape is used a single value will be needed. When calipers are used the maximum and the minimum diameter (over bark) shall be determined and reported (diameter 1 and diameter 2). 
(28) Bark 
The thickness of the bark at 1,30 m, expressed in centimetres with one decimal. 
(29) Height of the tree 
The height of the tree expressed in metres and rounded off to the nearest 0,5 metres. 
(30) Tree volume 
Based on the measured diameter(s) and height, the tree volume can be estimated using locally known form factors or through the use of valid volume tables. The tree volume shall be expressed in cubic metres (m¬≥) with three decimals. 
(31) Crown length 
The length of the crown rounded off to the nearest 0,5 metres is determined from the tip of the stem to the lowest live branch excluding water shoots. 
(32) Crown width 
The average crown width is determined by the average of at least four crown radii, multiplied by two, and rounded off to the nearest 0,5 metres. 
(33) Diameter under bark 
The actual diameter under bark is calculated as the diameter over bark deducted with the width of the bark at the two sides. The diameter under bark of five years ago is calculated as the actual diameter under bark less the increment of the last five years of the tree at both sides. The diameter under bark is expressed in 0,1 centimeters. 
(34) Basal area per plot 
The actual basal area per plot is calculated as the total basal areas of all the trees in the plot. The basal area per plot of five years ago is calculated on the basis of the estimated diameter under bark of five years ago of all the trees in the plot. Basal area per plot is expressed in 0,1 m¬≤. 
(35) Volume per plot 
The actual volume per plot is calculated as the total volume of all the trees in the plot. The volume per plot of five years ago is calculated on the basis of the estimated diameter under bark of five years ago of all the trees in the plot. Volume per plot is expressed in 0,1 m¬≥. 
(36) Thinnings 
If a thinning has taken place in the five-year period between the two years of determination of diameter, basal area per plot and volume per plot, this will be indicated (Yes = 1, No = 0). In an additional part the details of this thinning will be described as detailed as possible (including: thinning method, exact year of thinning, thinning intensity expressed as number of trees, basal area/ha, volume/ha).

Relevant information shall be stated here and explained in the corresponding evaluation report (see Annex VIIb). 
ANNEX VIIb 
Details for the submission of background information and interpretation of the permanent plots I. General remarks 
As an annex to the submission of the inventoried results, Member States shall prepare a document with the background information and the interpretation of the results, either plot wise or for all national observation plots. 
- In principle each submission of inventory data shall be accompanied by background information describing the actually applied methods of determination/sampling/measuring, etc., details on the methods of recording and validating, as described below under paragraph II. 
- Together with the survey results, an interpretation as indicated below in paragraph III shall be included. 
- When data from more surveys are submitted at the same time (or have been submitted before) an integrated interpretation (as indicated in paragraph IV) shall be submitted in addition to the interpretation mentioned under the second indent of this paragraph. 
This annex presents information on the structure of these reports. 
II. Background information 
II.1. General information 
The general part shall contain information on (country wise or when relevant province/region wise): 
- forest area (in 1 000 ha), 
- number of plots (total), 
- number of plots (in the submitted survey), 
- selection criteria (if submitted number of plots is less than total number of plots), 
- history of these plots with regard to this survey, 
- relations with other surveys. 
II.2. Inventory methods 
A summary of the inventory method shall be given, including details on used equipment, installation and recording. Especially where these details have not been laid down in a mandatory way, a clear review of the executed inventory method is essential for further interpretation, possible comparability, and the evaluation of the obtained results. In many surveys there is a large freedom in the selection of equipment, depths, timing and intensity of the survey. Details on the used equipment, recorded depths, timing and frequency of the survey/sampling shall be stated. Whenever samples have been taken, details on this sampling including the storage (cool, dark, etc.) shall be supplied. 
Any applied control measurements shall be described in short. 
II.3. Methods for the analysis and calculation of results 
With regard to chemical analysis of samples, in most cases certain methods are recommended. Information on the actually used methods (including storage, evaluation and (re-)calculation of the obtained results) shall be supplied. Whenever applicable the results of the calibration tests shall be reported. 
II.4. Exceptions and disturbances 
Special attention shall be given to exceptional situations with regard to the inventory, sampling, storage, analysis, calculation and/or interpretation. When gaps exist in the data, due to whatever reasons, estimates based on results from other sources can be made in certain cases. These assumptions shall be carefully documented. 
Regional differences shall be stated and explained in detail (e. g. different laboratory). 
III. Interpretation within one survey 
III.1. Actual internal interpretation 
An interpretation shall be made of the collected and evaluated data for each survey separately. Whenever possible relations between the different parameters in this survey shall be indicated. 
III.2. Internal interpretation with former surveys 
The results of consecutive surveys shall be evaluated and whenever possible trends shall be indicated. 
III.3. Interpretation with external data 
The results of the survey shall be reviewed and compared to results from other (similar) surveys carried out in the (same) region/country. Differences and similarities are to be indicated and when applicable the differences should be evaluated. Also data from other sources which could explain certain relations in parameters shall be included here. 
IV. Integrated interpretation 
IV.1. Actual interpretation 
In the national focal centre all survey results on a national level are collected. The relationship between parameters of different surveys shall be investigated. Also the various interpretations of the single survey results shall be taken into account and shall be reviewed in the light of the integration. 
IV.2. Interpretation with former years 
National level results from former surveys shall also be used in the integrated interpretation. Whenever possible trends shall be indicated and explained. 
IV.3. Interpretation with external data 
The found results of the integrated interpretation shall be reviewed and compared to results from other sources. Differences and/or similarities shall be noted and explained whenever possible.
