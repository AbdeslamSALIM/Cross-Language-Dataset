Commission Regulation (EC) No 2336/2003 
of 30 December 2003 
introducing certain detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 670/2003 laying down specific measures concerning the market in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 670/2003 of 8 April 2003 laying down specific measures concerning the market in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 3(1), the first subparagraph of Article 3(3), Article 4(4) and Article 11 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) To allow the Commission to establish the Community alcohol balance provided for in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 670/2003 and to have an overview of the development of trade, the Member States should regularly send to the Commission, in a standard format, data on the quantities of alcohol produced, imported, exported and disposed of, and on the stocks held at the end of the marketing year and estimated production. 
(2) Ethyl alcohol of non-agricultural origin may, for certain uses, be used as a substitute for alcohol of agricultural origin. As a result the Community balance should also incorporate this type of product. 
(3) The Member States and the Commission should be able to monitor trade developments on a permanent basis to allow a better appraisal of market development. To that end, provision should be made for issuing import licences. Reports on the import licences issued should be submitted each week. 
(4) The period of validity of licences should be laid down taking account of the uses and delivery deadlines practised in international trade. 
(5) In accordance with Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 670/2003, licences are to be issued subject to the lodging of a security which is forfeited in whole or in part if import is not carried out, or is only carried out partially. The amount of that security should therefore be laid down. 
(6) Save as otherwise provided in this Regulation, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(2) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(3) should apply to the import licences and securities provided for in this Regulation. 
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2541/84 of 4 September 1984 fixing a countervailing charge on imports into the other Member States of ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin produced in France(4) has become obsolete and should therefore be repealed. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
