"Procedure 
By letter dated 31 January 2002, registered on 4 February 2002, the British authorities notified the aid measure mentioned above, pursuant to Article 88(3) EC. By letter dated 28 February 2002, the Commission requested additional information, which was supplied by the British authorities by letter dated 26 April 2002, registered on 30 April 2002. The British authorities provided new elements concerning the notification by letter dated 13 May 2002. On 24 May 2002, a meeting was held between the British authorities and the Commission, which was followed by a new letter of request of information, sent on 4 July 2002. The British authorities replied by letter dated 13 September 2002, registered on 18 September 2002. It led to another letter of request of information from the Commission, dated 29 October 2002. The British authorities sent their reply on 3 December 2002, and it was registered on 9 December 2002. 
On 5 February 2003, the Commission decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty. The Commission decision was published in the Official Journal of the European Union [1]. The Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments on the aid. The Commission received thirty-three comments, which it forwarded to the United Kingdom by letter dated 1 July 2003. 
By letter dated 22 May 2003, registered on 27 May 2003, the UK authorities presented their comments. On 1 July 2003, a meeting was held between the UK authorities and the Commission. Following this meeting, Mr Griffiths, under-secretary of State for Small Business and Enterprise sent a letter dated 16 July 2003, registered on 17 July 2003, to Commissioner Monti. He replied by letter dated 4 August 2003. By letter dated 8 October 2003, registered on 9 October 2003, the UK authorities withdrew the notification. 
Assessment 
After the withdrawal of the notification, the procedure does no longer have any object. 
Conclusion 
Therefore, the Commission has decided to close the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty on the ground that it is without subject."
