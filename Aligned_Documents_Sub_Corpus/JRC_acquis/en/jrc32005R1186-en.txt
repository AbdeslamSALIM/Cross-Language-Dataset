Commission Regulation (EC) No 1186/2005 
of 22 July 2005 
suspending the buying-in of butter in certain Member States 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products [1], 
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2771/1999 of 16 December 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards intervention on the market in butter and cream [2], and in particular Article 2 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 2771/1999 lays down that buying-in is to be opened or suspended by the Commission in a Member State, as appropriate, once it is observed that, for two weeks in succession, the market price in that Member State is below or equal to or above 92 % of the intervention price. 
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1145/2005 [3] establishes the most recent list of Member States in which intervention is suspended. This list must be adjusted as a result of the market prices communicated by Estonia pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 2771/1999. In the interests of clarity, the list in question should be replaced and Regulation (EC) No 1145/2005 should be repealed,
