Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/2001 of 14 June 2001 establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of hake in ICES sub-areas III, IV, V, VI and VII and ICES divisions VIII a, b, d, e and associated conditions for the control of activities of fishing vessels 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/2001 
of 14 June 2001 
establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of hake in ICES sub-areas III, IV, V, VI and VII and ICES divisions VIII a, b, d, e and associated conditions for the control of activities of fishing vessels 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 of 20 December 1992 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1181/98(2), and in particular Article 15(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In November 2000, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicated that the stock of hake in ICES sub-areas III, IV, V, VI and VII and ICES divisions VIII a, b, d, e is at serious risk of collapse. 
(2) The majority of this stock of hake inhabits ICES sub-areas V, VI and VII and ICES divisions VIII a, b, d, e. 
(3) At the Council meeting of 14 and 15 December 2000, the Commission and the Council noted the urgent requirement to establish a recovery plan for this stock of hake. 
(4) The immediate requirement is to reduce catches of juvenile hake by: 
- establishing a general increase in the mesh size of towed nets used to catch hake to which end it is necessary to derogate from conditions regarding mesh sizes of towed gears laid down in Annexes I and II to Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms(3) as last amended by Regulation 973/2001(4), 
- establishing geographical areas in which juvenile hake occur in high abundance and specifying that fishing with towed nets may take place in these areas only if these nets are of high mesh size, 
- establishing additional conditions to ensure that capture of juvenile hake by beam trawls is reduced. 
(5) To provide information on catches of juvenile hake by some vessels targeting hake and by other vessels targeting Norway lobsters, observers should be placed on board vessels engaged in such activities, taking into account the level of fishing activity by each Member State fishing in the appropriate areas. 
(6) Control measures additional to those laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2846/98(6), and specific control programmes defined according to Article 34c of the said Regulation are required to ensure compliance with the measures laid down in this Regulation. 
(7) Further conservation measures affecting fishing for Nephrops, which involves significants by-catches of hake, may be proposed in the light of recent scientific advice from ICES and the results of trials of more selective fishing gear that are currently being conducted. 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
This Regulation shall apply to fishing vessels operating within ICES sub-areas V and VI and ICES divisions VII b, c, f, g, h, j, k and ICES divisions VIII a, b, d, e. 
Article 2 
1. Notwithstanding the conditions laid down in Article 4(4) and Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 850/98, catches of hake (Merluccius merluccius) retained on board any vessel carrying any towed gear of mesh size 55 mm to 99 mm may not be in excess of 20 % of the weight of the total catch of marine organism retained on board. 
2. The conditions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to any vessel of length less than 12 metres overall which returns to port within 24 hours of its most recent departure from port. 
Article 3 
It shall be prohibited to use: 
(a) except in ICES sub-areas V and VI, any cod-end and/or extension piece of any towed nets except beam trawls of mesh size greater than 55 mm which is not constructed of single-twine netting material of which no twine is of thickness greater than 6 mm or of double-twine netting material of which no twine is of thickness greater than 4 mm; 
(b) any demersal towed net other than beam trawl incorporating a cod-end of mesh size range 70 mm to 89 mm having more than 120 meshes in any circumference of the said cod-end excluding the joinings and selvedges; 
(c) any demersal towed net which includes any individual quadrilateral mesh of which the bars of the mesh are not of approximately equal length; 
(d) any demersal towed net to which a cod-end of mesh size less than 100 mm is attached by any means other than being sewn into that part of the net anterior to the cod-end. 
Article 4 
It shall be prohibited to carry on board or deploy any beam trawl of mesh size equal to or greater than 70 mm unless the entire upper half of the anterior part of such a net consists of a panel of netting material of which no individual mesh is of mesh size less than 180 mm attached: 
- directly to the headline, or 
- to no more than three rows of netting material of any mesh size attached directly to the headline. 
The panel of netting shall extend towards the posterior of the net for at least the number of meshes determined by: 
(a) dividing the length in metres of the beam of the net by 12; 
(b) multiplying the result obtained in (a) by 5,400; 
(c) dividing the result obtained in (b) by the mesh size, in millimetres, of the smallest mesh in the panel; 
(d) ignoring any decimal or other fractions in the result obtained in (c).

- the estimated time of arrival at that location, 
- the quantities of hake retained on board, 
- the quantities of hake to be landed. 
2. Whenever on any occasion more than 500 kg of hake are to be landed from a Community fishing vessel, the master of the said vessel shall ensure that such landings are made only at ports designated under the conditions laid down in Article 12. 
3. The competent authorities of a Member State in which a landing of hake of 250 kg or more is to be made, may require that the discharge does not commence until authorised by the said authorities. 
Article 12 
1. Each Member State shall designate ports into which any landing of hake in excess of 500 kg shall take place.
