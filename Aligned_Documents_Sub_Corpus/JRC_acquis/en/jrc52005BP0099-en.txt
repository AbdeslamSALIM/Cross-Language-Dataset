The European Court of Auditors annual report

2. Notes the Ombudsman's explanation that the lower level of budget execution in 2003 was caused by the transition period following the retirement of the former Ombudsman and the election of the new Ombudsman; 
3. Notes that the Court of Auditors did not make any observations with regard to the execution of the budget; asks, therefore, how the Court intends to evaluate the budget execution of the Ombudsman in future; 
4. Notes, however, that the European Parliament gave a favourable opinion on the work of the European Ombudsman on the basis of his annual report [6]; records that 75% of the complaints received fell outside the Ombudsman's mandate, and that the Ombudsman only dealt with 363 enquiries although the overall caseload amounted to 2611 cases;

5. Welcomes the comprehensive information supplied to the Committee on Budgetary Control by the Ombudsman in his letter of 13 December 2004; 
6. Notes the documents relating to the framework agreement between the European Parliament and the Ombudsman on administrative and financial assistance; notes furthermore that Parliament performs the financial initiation function concerning Title I, relating to personnel; 
7. Recalls that the Ombudsman was looking into a low-cost way of travelling regularly to Frankfurt and Zurich airport; notes that the European Parliament and the Ombudsman have agreed that Parliament will lease a supplementary official car, to be placed at the Ombudsman's disposal, in return for the payment of monthly charges; wishes to be informed about the final solution; 
Annual activity report of the authorising officer and annual report of the internal auditor 
8. Welcomes the fact that the Ombudsman has willingly provided the authorising officer's and the internal auditor's annual reports, including a statement of assurance; 
9. Notes that the Ombudsman's office developed software for a case management system on the basis of a system used by a Belgian Ombudsman;

11. Asks the Ombudsman to report, in time for the 2004 discharge procedure, about the progress made in training financial actors with the help of vocational training courses; 
12. Welcomes the clear structure of the internal auditor's annual report No 4/2002, which states: "The initial findings did not reveal any areas of significant risk to budgetary implementation to the EO [European Ombudsman] ..." [7]; in addition, action plans have been set up, which will allow further strengthening of the control environment.
