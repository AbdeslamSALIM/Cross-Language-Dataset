THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products(1), as last amended by Directive 98/45/EC(2), and in particular Article 10(3) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) By means of Decision 2002/304/EC(3), the Commission approved the programmes with a view to obtaining the status of approved zones and of approved farms in non-approved zones with regard to one or more of the fish diseases viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) and infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN), including a programme for all continental and coastal areas of Finland. 
(2) Due to outbreaks of VHS in certain coastal areas, Finland has submitted amendments to its programme. The programme hereby provides for specific eradication measures for VHS in the affected coastal areas, with the final view to obtaining approved zone status as regards VHS and IHN for all continental and coastal areas of Finland. The programme includes non-discriminatory restrictions on movements of fish in order to prevent re-introduction of the diseases in question. 
(3) The amended programme submitted complies with the appropriate requirements of Directive 91/67/EEC. 
(4) The amended programme submitted by Finland should therefore be approved and Decision 2002/304/EC amended accordingly. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
