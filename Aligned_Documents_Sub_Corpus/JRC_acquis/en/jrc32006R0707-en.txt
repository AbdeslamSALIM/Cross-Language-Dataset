THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2002 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency [1], and in particular Articles 5(4) and 6(3) thereof, 
Whereas:

(2) Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2003 establishes that Member States may issue approvals of a limited duration until 28 September 2005, with regard to its Annexes II and IV. 
(3) The European Aviation Safety Agency (hereinafter referred to as the Agency) has undertaken an evaluation of the implication of the provisions for the duration of the validity of approvals and concluded that a new deadline should be established so that Member States can adapt their national legislation to the system of approvals of unlimited duration. 
(4) The results of conclusions of the investigation of past accidents, regarding ageing aircraft and fuel tank safety, emphasise the need to take into account new or modified maintenance instructions promulgated by the Type Certificate holder and to carry out regular reviews of the maintenance programme. 
(5) It is necessary to specify that personnel exercising certification privileges should be able to produce their licence as evidence of qualification if requested by an authorised person within 24 hours. 
(6) Regulation (EC) No 2042/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are based on opinions issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency in accordance with Articles 12(2)(b) and 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002.
