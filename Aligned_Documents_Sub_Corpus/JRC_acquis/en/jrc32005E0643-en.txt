Council Joint Action 2005/643/CFSP 
of 9 September 2005 
on the European Union Monitoring Mission in Aceh (Indonesia) (Aceh Monitoring Mission Ã¢&#x20AC;&#x201D; AMM) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 14 and third subparagraph of Article 25 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The European Union (EU) is committed to promote a lasting peaceful settlement to the conflict in Aceh (Indonesia) and to increase stability throughout South East Asia, including progress in the economic, legal, political and security sector reforms. 
(2) On 11 October 2004, the Council reiterated its attachment to a united, democratic, stable and prosperous Indonesia. It reiterated the EU's respect for the territorial integrity of the Republic of Indonesia and recognition of its importance as a major partner. The Council encouraged the Government of Indonesia (GoI) to seek peaceful solutions in conflict and potential conflict areas and welcomed the statement by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono that he intended to implement Special Autonomy for Aceh. The Council reaffirmed the EU's wish to build a closer partnership with Indonesia. 
(3) On 12 July 2005, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, on behalf of the GoI, invited the EU to participate in an Aceh Monitoring Mission to assist Indonesia in implementing the final agreement on Aceh. The GoI sent a similar invitation to the ASEAN countries Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. The Free Aceh Movement (GAM) also indicated its support for a participation of the EU. 
(4) On 18 July 2005, the Council noted the report of the Joint EU Council Secretariat/Commission assessment mission to Indonesia/Aceh. It welcomed the successful conclusion of the Helsinki negotiations and agreed that the EU was prepared, in principle, to provide observers to monitor implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). It asked the competent bodies to continue planning for a possible monitoring mission at the request of the parties and to establish contact with ASEAN and ASEAN countries with a view to their possible cooperation. 
(5) On 15 August 2005, the GoI and the GAM signed a MoU detailing the agreement and principles guiding the creation of conditions within which the government of the Acehnese people can be manifested through a fair and democratic process within the unitary state and constitution of the Republic of Indonesia. The MoU foresees the establishment of the Aceh Monitoring Mission to be established by the EU and ASEAN contributing countries with the mandate to monitor the implementation of the commitments taken by the GoI and the GAM in the MoU. 
(6) The MoU notably provides that the GoI is responsible for the security of all Aceh Monitoring Mission personnel in Indonesia and that a Status of Mission Agreement will be concluded between GoI and the EU. 
(7) The Aceh Monitoring Mission will be conducted in a situation which may deteriorate and could harm the objectives of the Common Foreign and Security Policy as set out in Article 11 of the Treaty. 
(8) In conformity with the guidelines of the European Council meeting in Nice on 7- 9 December 2000, this Joint Action should determine the role of the Secretary General/High Representative (SG/HR) in accordance with Articles 18 and 26 of the Treaty. 
(9) Article 14(1) of the Treaty calls for the indication of a financial reference amount for the whole period of implementation of the Joint Action. The indication of amounts to be financed by the EU budget illustrates the will of the political authority and is subject to the availability of commitment appropriations during the respective budget year,
