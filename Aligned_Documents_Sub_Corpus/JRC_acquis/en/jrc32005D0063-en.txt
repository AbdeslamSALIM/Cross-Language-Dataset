Commission Decision 
of 24 January 2005 
amending Annex II to Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on end-of life vehicles 
(notified under document number C(2004) 2735) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2005/63/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on end-of life vehicles [1], and in particular Article 4(2)(a) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 4(2)(a) of Directive 2000/53/EC prohibits the use of lead, mercury, cadmium or hexavalent chromium in materials and components of vehicles put on the market after 1 July 2003, other than in cases listed in Annex II to that Directive, under the conditions specified therein. 
(2) As product reuse, refurbishment and extension of life-time are beneficial, spare parts need to be available for the repair of vehicles which were already put on the market on 1 July 2003. The use of lead, mercury, cadmium or hexavalent chromium in spare parts put on the market after 1 July 2003 for the repair of such vehicles should thus be tolerated. 
(3) Directive 2000/53/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18 of Council Directive 75/442/EEC [2], 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
