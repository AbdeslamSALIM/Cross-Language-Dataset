2006/329/EC: Commission Decision of 20 February 2006 laying down a questionnaire to be used for reporting on the implementation of Directive 2000/76/EC on the incineration of waste (notified under document number C(2006) 438) (Text with EEA relevance) 
Commission Decision 
of 20 February 2006 
laying down a questionnaire to be used for reporting on the implementation of Directive 2000/76/EC on the incineration of waste 
(notified under document number C(2006) 438) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2006/329/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste [1] and, in particular, Article 15 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Member States had to implement Directive 2000/76/EC before 28 December 2002 and will have to report about the implementation in accordance with a questionnaire to be developed by the Commission. 
(2) The overall purpose of this questionnaire is, through Member States√¢&#x20AC;&#x2122; responses, to gather information on the implementation of Directive 2000/76/EC, and to identify approaches to regulating incineration and co-incineration plants across Member States. 
(3) The reporting period has to cover the first full three years after 28 December 2002, and has to be defined taking into account the reporting requirements of Directive 94/67/EC and 96/61/EC. Taking into account that Directive 2000/76/EC applies in full to all existing plants from 28 December 2005 onwards, and since the overwhelming majority of plants operated in the EU belong to the group of existing plants, and that Directive 94/67/EC is repealed as of 28 December 2005, and reporting under Directive 96/61/EC covers the period to 2006-2008 inclusive, the most appropriate first full reporting period is 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 6 of Council Directive 91/692/EEC [2], 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
1. Member States shall use the questionnaire laid down in the Annex for reporting on the implementation of Directive 2000/76/EC in accordance with Article 15 thereof. 
2. The first report shall cover the three year period starting from 1 January 2006 and shall be transmitted to the Commission by 30 September 2009 at the latest. 
Article 2 
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
