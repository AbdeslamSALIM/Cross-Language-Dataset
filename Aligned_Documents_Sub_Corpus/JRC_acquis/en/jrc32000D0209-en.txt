Whereas: 
(1) Council Decision 79/542/EEC(2), as last amended by Commission Decision 2000/2/EC(3), established a list of third countries from which Member States authorise imports of bovine animals, swine, equidae, sheep and goats, fresh meat and meat products. 
(2) The health conditions and veterinary certification for the temporary admission, imports and re-entry and of registered horses are laid down respectively in Commission Decisions 92/260/EEC(4) and 93/197/EEC(5), both as last amended by Commission Decisions 1999/613/EC(6) and 93/195/EEC(7), as last amended by Decision 1999/558/EC(8). 
(3) Following a Commission veterinary inspection mission to the Republic of Korea the animal health situation appears to be under the satisfactory control of the veterinary services. 
(4) The veterinary authorities of the Republic of Korea have provided a written undertaking to notify within 24 hours by fax, telegram or telex to the Commission and the Member States the confirmation of any infectious or contagious disease in equidae mentioned in Annex A to Directive 90/426/EEC, which are compulsorily notifiable in the country, and within due time any change in the vaccination or import policy in respect of equidae. 
(5) Following a serological survey carried out in preparation of the Olympic Games in 1986 and taking into account the results of the above inspections mission, the country should be considered free of glanders and dourine for at least six months; African horse sickness, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis and vesicular stomatitis have never occured.
