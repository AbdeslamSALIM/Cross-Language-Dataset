Commission Regulation (EC) No 1279/98 of 19 June 1998 laying down detailed rules for applying the tariff quotas for beef and veal provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 for the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania 
COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1279/98 of 19 June 1998 laying down detailed rules for applying the tariff quotas for beef and veal provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 for the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 of 22 December 1995 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreements to take account of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1595/97 (2), and in particular Article 8 thereof, 
Whereas Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 provides for the opening of reduced-tariff quotas for beef and veal; whereas detailed rules should be adopted for their application on a multiannual basis; whereas, to that end, the provisions laid down annually for those quotas in the past should be used as a basis; 
Whereas, in order to ensure that the quantities laid down are imported in an orderly fashion, they should be staggered over various periods; 
Whereas provision should be made for the arrangements to be administered by means of import licences; whereas, to that end, rules should in particular be laid down on the way applications are to be submitted and on the information to be shown in applications and licences, where appropriate notwithstanding certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1044/98 (4), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 759/98 (6); whereas provision should also be made for the licences to be issued after a period for reflection and, where appropriate, once a uniform percentage reduction has been applied; 
Whereas the risk of speculation inherent in the arrangements for the beef and veal sector requires that clear conditions be laid down governing access to the quotas; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
