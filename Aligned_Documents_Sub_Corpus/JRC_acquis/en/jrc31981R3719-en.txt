COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3719/81 of 21 December 1981 amending Regulation (EEC) No 357/79 on statistical surveys of areas under vines 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Whereas, pursuant to Article 22 of the 1979 Act of Accession, certain adjustments must be made to Council Regulation (EEC) No 357/79 of 5 February 1979 on statistical surveys of areas under vines (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1992/80 (4), in accordance with the guidelines given in Annex II to that Act; 
Whereas Article 1 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 357/79 provides that the Member States concerned shall carry out every 10 years basic surveys on the area under vines and annually intermediate surveys ; whereas, as a result of difficulties which could not have been foreseen, it was not possible to complete the first basic survey on the area under vines in one Member State within the prescribed period ; whereas it was therefore decided to grant an extension of the agreed period of one year to this Member State ; whereas this extension has proved insufficient because of further complications of a legislative nature ; whereas it is therefore advisable to allow this Member State to postpone for a further year the dates by which this survey must be completed and the results forwarded to the Commission; 
Whereas it is desirable that the Community should bear part of the expenditure incurred by Greece for the first basic survey conducted by this Member State,
