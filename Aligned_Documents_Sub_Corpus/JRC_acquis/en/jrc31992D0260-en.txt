92/260/EEC: Commission Decision of 10 April 1992 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for temporary admission of registered horses 
COMMISSION DECISION of 10 April 1992 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for temporary admission of registered horses (92/260/EEC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries of equidae (1), as last amended by Commission Decision 92/130/EEC (2), in particular Articles 15 (a) and 16 thereof, 
Whereas by Council Decision 79/542/EEC (3), as last amended by Commission Decision 92/162/EEC (4), the list of third countries from which the Member States authorize imports of equidae in particular has been established; 
Whereas it is also necessary to take into account the regionalization of certain third countries, which is the subject of Commission Decision 92/160/EEC (5), as amended by Decision 92/161/EEC (6); 
Whereas the existence of equivalent health situations between certain third countries justifies establishing several health zones for the importation of equidae; 
Whereas the different categories of horses have their own features and their imports are authorized for different purposes; whereas, consequently, specific health requirements must be established for temporary admissions of registered horses; 
Whereas, given the existence of different health situations, it is necessary to establish several health certificates for temporary admission of registered horses; 
Whereas this Decision should be re-examined before 31 December 1992; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
Without prejudice to Decision 92/160/EEC, Member States shall authorize the temporary admission of registered horses: 
- coming from third countries appearing in Annex I, 
- conforming to the requirements laid down in one of the specimen animal health certificates in Annex II. 
Article 2 
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
