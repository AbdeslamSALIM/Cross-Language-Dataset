amending Regulation (EC) No 14/2004 as regards the forecast supply balances for various agricultural products for the outermost regions 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1452/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the French overseas departments, amending Directive 72/462/EEC and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 525/77 and No 3763/91 (Poseidom) [1], and in particular Article 3(6) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1453/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the Azores and Madeira and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 (Poseima) [2], and in particular Articles 3(6) and 4(5) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the Canary Islands and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 (Poseican) [3], and in particular Articles 3(6) and 4(5) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 14/2004 of 30 December 2003 establishing the supply balances and Community aid for the supply of certain essential products for human consumption, for processing and as agricultural inputs and for the supply of live animals and eggs to the outermost regions under Council Regulations (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001 and (EC) No 1454/2001 [4] establishes forecast supply balances and fixes the Community aid. 
(2) Current implementation of the annual supply balances for various products for the French overseas departments, the Azores and Madeira, and the Canary Islands shows that the quantities set for supplies of the above products are below requirements owing to unexpectedly higher demand. 
(3) The quantities and descriptions of these products should be brought into line with actual needs in the outermost regions concerned. 
(4) Regulation (EC) No 14/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of the Management Committees concerned,
