References for a preliminary ruling — Cour d'appel de Liège, Tribunal de première instance de Liège — Interpretation of Articles 25 EC, 87 EC and 90 EC — State aid — Exemption from a municipal tax and a provincial tax on motive force solely for motors used for the distribution of natural gas, to the exclusion of motors used in the distribution of industrial gas 
Operative part of the judgment 
1. The exemption from a municipal or provincial tax on motive force granted solely in respect of motors used in natural gas stations, to the exclusion of motors used for other industrial gases, may be regarded as State aid within the meaning of Article 87 EC. It is for the referring courts to establish whether the conditions relating to the existence of State aid are met. 
2. The fact that a tax exemption, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, may be unlawful in the light of Community law on State aid does not affect the legality of the tax itself, so that undertakings liable to pay such a tax cannot rely before national courts on the argument that the exemption was unlawful, in order to avoid payment of the tax or to obtain reimbursement of it. 
3. A tax on motive force, levied in particular on motors used for transporting industrial gas through very high pressure pipes, does not constitute a charge having equivalent effect within the meaning of Article 25 EC. 
4. A tax on motive force, levied in particular on motors used for transporting industrial gas through very high pressure pipes, does not constitute discriminatory internal taxation for the purposes of Article 90 EC.
