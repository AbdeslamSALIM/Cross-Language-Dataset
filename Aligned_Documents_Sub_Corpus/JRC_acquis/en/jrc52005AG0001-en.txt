Common Position (EC) No 1/2005 of 19 July 2004 adopted by the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, with a view to the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC 
Common position (EC) No 1/2005 
adopted by the Council on 19 July 2004 
with a view to the adoption of Regulation (EC) No.../2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of... on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2005/C 25E/01) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 37 and 152(4)(b) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1], 
Having consulted the Committee of the Regions, 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2], 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Directive 76/895/EEC of 23 November 1976 relating to the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on fruit and vegetables [3], Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals [4], Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin [5], and Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables [6], have been substantially amended several times. In the interests of clarity and simplicity, those Directives should be repealed and replaced by a single act. 
(2) Differences in national maximum residue levels for pesticides can pose barriers to trade in products included in Annex I to the Treaty and products derived therefrom between Member States and trade between third countries and the Community. Accordingly, in the interest of free movement of goods and equal competition conditions among the Member States, as well as consumer protection, it is appropriate that maximum residue levels (MRLs) for products of plant and animal origin be set at Community level. 
(3) A Regulation establishing MRLs does not require transposition into national law in the Member States. It is therefore the most appropriate legal instrument with which to set MRLs for pesticides in products of plant and animal origin, as its precise requirements are to be applied at the same time and in the same manner throughout the Community and accordingly permit a more efficient use of national resources. 
(4) The production and consumption of plant and animal products play a very important role in the Community. The yield from plant production is continually being affected by harmful organisms. It is essential to protect plants and plant products against such organisms, not only to prevent a reduction in yield or damage to them but also in order to ensure the quality of the products harvested, to increase agricultural productivity, and to protect the natural environment by limiting the surface area needed for agricultural production. 
(5) One of the most important methods of protecting plants and plant products from the effects of harmful organisms is the use of active substances in plant protection products. However, a possible consequence of their use may be the presence of residues in the treated products, in animals feeding on those products and in honey produced by bees exposed to those substances. It is necessary to ensure that such residues should not be present at levels presenting an unacceptable risk to humans and, where relevant, to animals. 
(6) Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market [7] provides that Member States, when issuing authorisations, are to prescribe that plant protection products be used properly. Proper use includes the application of the principles of good plant protection practice as well as the principles of integrated control. Where the MRLs arising from an authorised use of a pesticide under Directive 91/414/EEC present a risk to the consumer such use should be revised to decrease the levels of pesticide residues. The Community should encourage the use of methods or products favouring a reduction in risk, and a reduction in the amounts of pesticides used to levels consistent with efficient pest control. 
(7) A number of active substances are banned under Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances [8]. At the same time, many other active substances are not currently authorised under Directive 91/414/EEC. The residues of active substances in products of plant and animal origin arising from unauthorised use or from environmental contamination or from use in third countries should be carefully controlled and monitored. 
(8) The basic rules with regard to food and feed law are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety [9]. 
(9) In addition to those basic rules, more specific rules are needed to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market and trade with third countries in relation to fresh, processed and/or composite plant and animal products intended for human consumption or animal feed in which pesticide residues may be present, whilst providing the basis for securing a high level of protection for human and animal health and the interests of consumers. Such rules should include the establishment of specific MRLs for each pesticide in food and feed products and the quality of the data underlying these MRLs. 
(10) Notwithstanding the fact that the principles of the general food law laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 apply only to feed for food-producing animals, in view of the difficulty of segregating products to be used as feed intended for animals which are not destined for food production and in order to facilitate the control and the enforcement of the provisions of this Regulation, it is appropriate to apply them also to feed which is not intended for food-producing animals. However, this Regulation should not be an obstacle to the tests which are necessary in order to assess pesticides. 
(11) Directive 91/414/EEC lays down basic rules with respect to the use and placing on the market of plant protection products. In particular the use of those products should have no harmful effects on humans or on animals. Pesticide residues resulting from uses of plant protection products may have harmful effects on the health of consumers. It is therefore appropriate that rules for MRLs for products intended for human consumption be defined that are linked to the authorisation for use of plant protection products as defined under Directive 91/414/EEC. Similarly that Directive needs to be adapted in order to take into account the Community procedure for the establishment of MRLs under this Regulation. Pursuant to that Directive, a Member State may be designated as rapporteur for the evaluation of an active substance. It is appropriate to use the expertise in that Member State for the purposes of this Regulation. 
(12) It is appropriate that specific rules concerning the control of pesticide residues be introduced to complement the general Community provisions on the control of food and feed. 
(13) Specific rules for animal feed including marketing, storage of feed and feeding of animals are provided for in Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 May 2002 on undesirable substances in animal feed [10]. For certain products it is not possible to determine whether they will be transformed into food or animal feed. Therefore the pesticide residues in such products should be safe both for human and, where relevant, for animal consumption. Accordingly it is appropriate that the rules set out in this Regulation also apply to those products in addition to the specific rules for animal nutrition. 
(14) It is necessary to define at Community level certain terms used for the setting and control of MRLs for products of plant and animal origin. 
(15) Directive 76/895/EEC provides that Member States may authorise higher levels of MRLs than are currently authorised at Community level. That possibility should cease to exist as, in view of the internal market, it could create obstacles to intra-Community trade. 
(16) The determination of MRLs for pesticides requires lengthy technical consideration and includes an assessment of potential risks to consumers. Therefore, MRLs cannot be set immediately for the residues of pesticides currently regulated by Directive 76/895/EEC or for pesticides for which Community MRLs have not yet been set. 
(17) It is appropriate that the minimum data requirements to be used when considering the setting of MRLs for pesticides be laid down at Community level. 
(18) In exceptional circumstances, and in particular for unauthorised pesticides that may be present in the environment, it is appropriate to permit the use of monitoring data in setting MRLs. 
(19) MRLs for pesticides should be continually monitored and should be changed to take account of new information and data. MRLs should be set at the lower level of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residues. Where uses of pesticides are not authorised at Community level, MRLs should be set at an appropriately low level to protect the consumer from the intake of unauthorised or excessive levels of pesticides residues. In order to facilitate control of residues of pesticides, a default value is to be set for pesticide residues present in products or groups of products covered by Annex I for which no MRLs have been established in Annexes II or III, unless the active substance in question is listed in Annex IV. It is appropriate to set the default value at 0,01 mg/kg and to provide for the possibility of setting it at a different level for active substances covered by Annex V, taking into account the routine analytical methods available and/or consumer protection. 
(20) For food and feed produced outside the Community, different agricultural practices as regards the use of plant protection products may be legally applied, sometimes resulting in pesticide residues differing from those resulting from uses legally applied in the Community. It is therefore appropriate that MRLs be fixed for imported products that take these uses and the resulting residues into account provided that the safety of the products can be demonstrated using the same criteria as for domestic produce. 
(21) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 establishes procedures for taking emergency measures in relation to food and feed of Community origin or imported from a third country. Those procedures allow the Commission to adopt such measures in situations where food is likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health or the environment and where such risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by measures taken by the Member State(s) concerned. It is appropriate that these measures and their effect on humans and, where relevant, animals be assessed by the European Food Safety Authority ('the Authority'). 
(22) The lifetime exposure, and where appropriate the acute exposure of consumers to pesticide residues via food products, should be evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. 
(23) Through the World Trade Organisation, the Community's trading partners should be consulted about the MRLs proposed, and their observations should be taken into account before the MRLs are adopted. MRLs set at the international level by the Codex Alimentarius Commission should also be considered when Community MRLs are being set. 
(24) It is necessary that the Authority assess MRL applications and evaluation reports prepared by the Member States with a view to determining the associated risks to consumers and, where relevant, to animals. 
(25) Member States should lay down rules on sanctions applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those sanctions are to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 
(26) The development of a Community-harmonised system for MRLs entails the development of guidelines, databases and other activities with associated costs. It is appropriate for the Community in certain cases to make a contribution to those costs. 
(27) It is good administrative practice and technically desirable to coordinate the timing of decisions on MRLs for active substances with decisions taken for those substances under Directive 91/414/EEC. For many substances for which Community MRLs have not yet been set, decisions are not due to be taken under that Directive before the date of entry into force of this Regulation. 
(28) It is therefore necessary to adopt separate rules providing for temporary but mandatory harmonised MRLs, with a view to setting MRLs progressively as decisions are taken on individual active substances as part of the evaluations under Directive 91/414/EEC. Such temporary harmonised MRLs should be based, in particular, on existing national MRLs established by the Member States and should respect the national arrangements by which they were established, provided that the MRLs do not present an unacceptable risk to consumers. 
(29) Following the inclusion of existing active substances in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, Member States are to re-evaluate each plant protection product containing those active substances within four years of the date of inclusion. The MRLs concerned should be retained for a period of up to four years to provide for continuity of authorisations and, on completion of re-evaluation, should be made definitive if they are supported by dossiers which satisfy Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC, or be set to a default level if they are not so supported. 
(30) This Regulation establishes MRLs for the control of pesticide residues in food and feed. It is therefore appropriate that Member States establish national programmes to control these residues. The results of the national control programmes are to be submitted to the Commission, the Authority and the other Member States and included in the Community annual report. 
(31) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [11]. 
(32) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objectives of facilitating trade whilst protecting the consumer to lay down rules on MRLs for products of plant and animal origin. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

CHAPTER II 
PROCEDURE FOR APPLICATIONS FOR MRLS 
SECTION 1 
SUBMISSION OF APPLICATIONS FOR MRLS 
Article 6 
Applications 
1. Where a Member State envisages granting an authorisation or a provisional authorisation for the use of a plant protection product in accordance with Directive 91/414/EEC, that Member State shall consider whether, as a result of such use, an existing MRL set out in Annex II or III to this Regulation needs to be modified, whether it is necessary to set a new MRL, or whether the active substance should be included in Annex IV. If necessary it shall require the party requesting the authorisation to submit an application in accordance with Article 7. 
2. Parties demonstrating, through adequate evidence, a legitimate interest, including manufacturers, growers and producers of products covered by Annex I may also submit an application to a Member State in accordance with Article 7. 
3. Where a Member State considers that the setting, modification or deletion of an MRL is necessary, that Member State may also compile and evaluate an application for setting, modifying or deleting the MRL in accordance with Article 7. 
4. Applications for import tolerances shall be submitted to rapporteur Member States designated pursuant to Directive 91/414/EEC or, if no such rapporteur has been designated, applications shall be made to Member States designated by the Commission in accordance with procedure referred to in Article 45(2) of this Regulation at the request of the applicant.

For that purpose, a request shall be submitted to the Commission within two months after the day on which the party concerned became aware of the act or omission in question. 
The Commission shall take a decision within two months requiring, if appropriate, the Authority to withdraw its decision or to remedy its failure to act within a set time-limit. 
SECTION 3 
SETTING, MODIFYING OR DELETION OF MRLS 
Article 14 
Decisions on applications concerning MRLs 
1. Upon receipt of the opinion of the Authority and taking into account that opinion, a Regulation on the setting, modification or deletion of an MRL or a Decision rejecting the application shall be prepared by the Commission without delay and at the latest within three months, and submitted for adoption in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 45(2). 
2. With regard to the acts referred to in paragraph 1, account shall be taken of: 
(a) the scientific and technical knowledge available; 
(b) the possible presence of pesticide residues arising from sources other than current plant protection uses of active substances; 
(c) the results of an assessment of any potential risks to the consumer and, where appropriate, to animals; 
(d) the results of any evaluations and decisions to modify the uses of plant protection products; 
(e) a CXL or a GAP implemented in a third country for the legal use of an active substance in that country; 
(f) other legitimate factors relevant to the matter under consideration. 
3. The Commission may request at any time that supplementary information be provided by the applicant or by the Authority. The Commission shall make available any supplementary information received to the Member States and the Authority. 
Article 15 
Inclusion of new or modified MRLs in Annexes II and III 
1. The Regulation referred in Article 14(1) shall: 
(a) set new or modified MRLs and list them in Annex II to this Regulation where the active substances have been included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC; or 
(b) where the active substances have not been included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and where they are not included in Annex II to this Regulation, set or modify temporary MRLs and list them in Annex III to this Regulation; or 
(c) in the cases mentioned in Article 16, set temporary MRLs and list them in Annex III to this Regulation. 
2. Where a temporary MRL is set as provided for in paragraph 1(b), it shall be deleted from Annex III by a Regulation one year after the date of the inclusion or non-inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substance concerned, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 45(2) of this Regulation. However, where one or more Member States so requests, it may be maintained for an additional year pending confirmation that any scientific studies necessary for supporting an application for setting a MRL have been undertaken. In cases where such confirmation is provided, the temporary MRL shall be maintained for a further two years, provided that no unacceptable safety concerns for the consumer have been identified. 
Article 16 
Procedure for setting temporary MRLs in certain circumstances 
1. The Regulation referred to in Article 14(1) may also set a temporary MRL to be included in Annex III in the following circumstances: 
(a) in exceptional cases, in particular where pesticide residues may arise as a result of environmental or other contamination or from uses of plant protection products pursuant to Article 8(4) of Directive 91/414/EEC; or 
(b) where the products concerned constitute a minor component of the diet of consumers and, where relevant, of animals; or 
(c) for honey; or 
(d) where essential uses of plant protection products have been identified by a Decision to delete an active substance from, or not to include an active substance in, Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. 
2. The inclusion of temporary MRLs as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on the opinion of the Authority, monitoring data and an assessment demonstrating that there are no unacceptable risks to consumers or animals. 
The continued validity of the temporary MRLs referred to in paragraph 1(a), (b) and (c) shall be reassessed at least once every 10 years and any such MRLs shall be modified or deleted as appropriate. 
The MRLs referred to in paragraph 1(d) shall be reassessed at the expiry of the period for which the essential use was authorised. 
Article 17 
Modifications of MRL following revocation of authorisations of plant protection products 
Amendments to Annexes II or III needed to delete an MRL following the revocation of an existing authorisation for a plant protection product may be adopted without seeking the opinion of the Authority. 
CHAPTER III 
MRLS APPLICABLE TO PRODUCTS OF PLANT AND ANIMAL ORIGIN 
Article 18 
Compliance with MRLs 
1. The products covered by Annex I shall not contain, from the time they are placed on the market as food or feed, or fed to animals, any pesticide residue exceeding: 
(a) the MRLs for those products set out in Annexes II and III; 
(b) 0,01 mg/kg for those products for which no specific MRL is set out in Annexes II or III, or for active substances not listed in Annex IV unless different default values are fixed for an active substance in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 45(2) while taking into account the routine analytical methods available. Such default values shall be listed in Annex V. 
2. Member States may not prohibit or impede the placing on the market or the feeding to food-producing animals within their territories of the products covered by Annex I on the grounds that they contain pesticide residues provided that: 
(a) such products comply with Articles 18(1) and 20; or 
(b) the active substance is listed in Annex IV. 
3. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States may authorise, further to a post-harvest treatment with a fumigant on their own territory, residue levels for an active substance which exceed the limits specified in Annexes II and III for a product covered by Annex I where the active substance/product combinations are listed in Annex VII provided that: 
(a) such products are not intended for immediate consumption; 
(b) appropriate controls are in place to ensure that such products cannot be made available to the end user or consumer, if they are supplied directly to the latter, until the residues no longer exceed the maximum levels specified in Annexes II or III; 
(c) the other Member States and the Commission have been informed of the measures taken.

-------------------------------------------------- 
Statement of the Council's reasons 
I. INTRODUCTION 
On 14 March 2003 the Council received from the Commission a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on maximum residue levels of pesticides in products of plant and animal origin. 
The European Parliament adopted its opinion at a first reading on 20 April 2004. The European Economic and Social Committee adopted its opinion on 16 July 2003. 
The Council adopted its common position on 19 July 2004, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty. 
II. OBJECTIVES 
The proposal overhauls and streamlines European pesticides legislation by replacing four existing Council Directives with a single Regulation. The aim of the new, harmonised provisions is twofold: to facilitate trade within the Single Market and with third countries, import tolerances being granted to exporters to the EU in certain cases, and to ensure a consistent level of consumer protection across the Community. The proposal also provides for the role of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in this field. Under the new provisions, as amended by the Council, following a transitional period, MRLs would only be set at Community level through a procedure where Member States assess the need for an MRL and submit an evaluation report to the Commission. EFSA would be responsible for risk assessment based on the Member State evaluation report and data received from applicants, while the Commission would handle risk management by setting MRLs. 
III. ANALYSIS OF THE COMMON POSITION 
A. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 
The Council's common position broadly accords with the positions taken by the Commission and the Parliament, inasmuch as it: 
- confirms the objectives and most of the arrangements proposed by the Commission and supported by the European Parliament; 
- includes a large number of the amendments adopted at first reading by the European Parliament. 
In particular, the Council agreed with a series of parliamentary amendments aiming to ensure the smooth functioning of the new procedures and to increase consistency between the new Regulation and other Community legislation. In addition, the Council felt that it was appropriate to introduce further amendments, for example, to allow Member States the flexibility to deal with MRL exceedences that arise in certain exceptional cases. The Council also reordered and reformatted parts of the text of the Regulation so as to clarify the roles of the Member States, EFSA and the Commission and to separate transitional provisions from the standard procedures under the new regime. A number of technical and editorial amendments were also introduced. 
B. SPECIFIC COMMENTS 
(a) Application procedure: the respective roles of the EFSA and the Member States 
In its proposal, the Commission had foreseen an exclusive role for EFSA in scientific evaluation work and the setting of MRLs. However, the Council agreed with the Parliament that Member States should perform a preliminary analysis of MRL applications in line with established procedures under Directive 91/414/EEC. In addition, the Council agreed that a copy of MRL applications received by Member States should immediately be sent to the Commission and to EFSA (Article 8). 
(b) Procedure for routine work performed by EFSA 
In the light of the substantial workload foreseen for EFSA, the Council introduced a new article designed to avoid unnecessary consultation of scientific bodies on matters of routine, i.e. in cases where EFSA issues opinions purely based on well-established scientific principles (Article 44). This provision is analogous to Article 31 of Regulation 178/2002/EC. 
(c) Administrative review 
A new article was added with a view to providing a form of legal redress regarding decisions taken by EFSA and also in the event of non-action by EFSA (Article 13). 
(d) Time scale and transition to the new procedures 
To ensure a smooth transition to the new provisions, the Council followed the Parliament in setting down specific deadlines for the completion of the principal technical annexes, which will set out a list of harmonised MRLs (Annex II), a list of harmonised temporary MRLs (Annex III) and a list of active substances for which no MRLs are required (Annex IV). In the same spirit, the Council also introduced a deadline for drawing up the annex listing the products to which harmonised MRLs will apply (Annex I). Like Parliament, the Council considered that the Regulation should not apply in full until after the crucial annexes have been drawn up (Articles 4, 5, 21, 22 and 50). 
(e) Possibility to extend the validity of temporary MRLs 
In order to facilitate a smooth transition to a fully harmonised regime (e.g. where Member States indicate that extra time is required to complete scientific studies on substances that have been authorised nationally), the Council decided that it should be possible for temporary MRLs, which will normally be valid for one year, to be maintained in Annex III for up to three additional years in certain cases (Article 15). 
(f) The use of pesticides for post-harvest treatment 
A derogation was introduced in order to provide for the practice of post-harvest fumigation of products (e.g. with a view to protecting them against pests during storage and transport, which can entail the temporary exceedence of MRLs while the product remains in storage or transit) (Article 18(3)). 
(g) The use of pesticides in exceptional circumstances 
In order to provide for exceptional circumstances (e.g. when an emergency use of a plant protection product is required to control pest(s) in accordance with Article 8(4) of Directive 91/414/EEC), emergency provisions were introduced allowing a Member State to authorise the placing on the market and/or the feeding to animals within its territory of food or feed that is not in compliance with the MRLs laid down in the Regulation. Such authorisations are to be notified to the other Member States, the Commission and EFSA, with a view to setting temporary MRLs and taking any other necessary actions. Such authorisations can only be granted provided that the treated food or feed does not constitute an unacceptable risk to consumers (Article 18(4)). 
(h) Definitions 
In redrafting the text to improve legal clarity, the Council added two new definitions, namely "critical GAP" (i.e. the Good Agricultural Practice that forms the basis for a harmonised MRL under the Regulation) and "CXL" (i.e. an MRL set by the Codex Alimentarius Commission), and deleted the definition of "composite foodstuffs". In addition, the Council followed the European Parliament in clarifying the definition of "pesticide residues" (Article 3). 
(i) Technical and editorial amendments 
A large number of other changes, including technical adjustments and clarifications, were also made. 
(j) Amendments not accepted by Council 
Further discussion is needed, in particular, on issues associated with risk assessment, and on provisions concerning the use of plant protection products, where Council was unable to agree to a number of Parliament's amendments at this stage. Such items concern, in particular, approaches to exposure assessment in the context of MRL-setting, considerations surrounding the most appropriate way of providing information to the public, and the drafting of provisions concerning good agricultural practice and pest management.
