Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and imports from third countries of equidae (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in particular Articles 12, 13, 15, 16 and 19(ii) thereof, 
(1) Whereas by Council Decision 79/542/EEC (2), as last amended by Decision 1999/227/EC (3), a list of third countries has been established from which Member States authorise imports of bovine animals, swine, equidae, sheep and goats, fresh meat and meat products; 
(2) Whereas by Decision 92/160/EEC (4), as last amended by Decision 1999/228/EC, the Commission has established the regionalisation of certain third countries for imports of equidae; 
(3) Whereas the health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of registered horses are laid down in Commission Decision 93/197/EEC (5), as last amended by Decision 1999/227/EC; 
(4) Whereas following a Commission veterinary inspection mission to Kyrgyzstan the animal health situation with regard to equidae appears to be under the satisfactory control of the veterinary services; 
(5) Whereas the veterinary authorities of Kyrgyzstan have provided a written undertaking to notify within 24 hours by telefax, telegram or telex to the Commission and the Member States the confirmation of any infectious or contagious disease in equidae mentioned in Annex A of Directive 90/426/EEC, which are compulsorily notifiable in the country, and within due time any change in the vaccination or import policy in respect of equidae; 
(6) Whereas annual testing of horses for glanders is carried out in Kyrgyzstan and no positive findings have been reported for at least six months; whereas African horse sickness, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis and vesicular stomatitis have never occurred in Kyrgyzstan; 
(7) Whereas monitoring for equine viral arteritis has only commenced and the country's status with regard to this disease cannot be established definitely; whereas therefore uncastrated male horses older than 180 days intended for imports into the Community should be subject to laboratory testing for this disease; 
(8) Whereas dourine has been reported in certain parts of Kyrgyzstan, whereas, however, the Issyk-Kul region has been free of dourine for at least six months and official guarantees have been received that the movement of equidae into this region from the rest of the country is under official veterinary control; 
(9) Whereas for reason of the equine health situation in certain parts of Kyrgyzstan it appears appropriate to regionalise the country concerned, so as to allow imports into the Community of registered horses only from the disease free part of the territory of Kyrgyzstan; 
(10) Whereas the animal health conditions and veterinary certification must be adopted according to the animal health situation of the third country concerned; whereas the present case relates only to registered horses; 
(11) Whereas Decision 79/542/EEC and Decisions 92/160/EEC and 93/197/EEC must be amended accordingly;
