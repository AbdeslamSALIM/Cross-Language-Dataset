Commission Regulation (EC) No 1583/2005 
of 29 September 2005 
opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Spanish market of maize held by the Slovak intervention agency 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [1], and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 of 28 July 1993 laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies [2] provides in particular that cereals held by intervention agencies are to be sold by tendering procedure at prices preventing market disturbance. 
(2) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of Spain, cereals production has been significantly reduced in the 2005/06 marketing year. This situation has already resulted in high local prices, causing supply difficulties at competitive prices. 
(3) Slovakia has significant intervention stocks of maize, outlets for which are hard to find and which should therefore be disposed of. 
(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1081/2005 [3] opened a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Spanish market of maize held by the Slovak intervention agency, which expired on 14 September 2005 even though the quantities made available under that Regulation had not been fully used up, in particular as a result of difficulties linked to the entry of the cereals into the Spanish ports. 
(5) In view of the continuing market situation and the projected applications by operators, stocks of maize held by the Slovak intervention agency should continue to be made available on the Spanish cereals market, in quantities equivalent to those fixed during the previous invitation to tender. However, the cereals should no longer be required to pass through specific Spanish sea ports. 
(6) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price. 
(7) It is also important that the Slovak intervention agency’s notification to the Commission should maintain the anonymity of the tenderers. 
(8) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail. 
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
1. The Slovak intervention agency shall open a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the Community market of 100000 tonnes of maize held by it. 
2. These sales are intended to supply the Spanish market. 
Article 2 
The sale provided for in Article 1 shall take place in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93. 
However, notwithstanding that Regulation: 
(a) tenders shall be drawn up on the basis of the actual quality of the lot to which they apply; 
(b) the minimum selling price shall be fixed at a level that does not disturb the cereals markets. 
Article 3

2. Tenders shall be valid only if they are accompanied by the tenderer’s written commitment to lodge a security of EUR 80 per tonne within two working days of the day on which the notice of award of contract is received.
