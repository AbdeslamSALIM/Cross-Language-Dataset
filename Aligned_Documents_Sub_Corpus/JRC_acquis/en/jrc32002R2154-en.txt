of 28 November 2002 
amending Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 on scrutiny by Member States of transactions forming part of the system of financing by the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2), 
Whereas: 
(1) The rules for the selection of undertakings to be scrutinised as laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89(3) should be modified in order to take account of developments in the use of risk-analysis techniques in other control measures, to take account of inflation since the last amendment to Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89, and to give Member States greater flexibility in the selection of undertakings. 
(2) Provision should be made for cases where Member States carry out joint actions involving mutual assistance between Member States. A reduction in the number of scrutinies, reflecting the selection of undertakings on the basis of risk-analysis techniques and enhanced mutual assistance, should not give rise to a deterioration in the quality of these scrutinies. 
(3) The provisions relating to the communication of requests for mutual assistance under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 should be simplified. 
(4) The provisions dealing with the financial participation of the Community in Member States' expenditure resulting from the application of Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 have become obsolete and should be deleted. 
(5) Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 therefore should be amended accordingly,
