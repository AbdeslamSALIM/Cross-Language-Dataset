COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 1014/90 
of 24 April 1990 
laying down detailed implementing rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 of 29 May 1989 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks (1), and in particular Article 1 (4) (f) (1) (a), (g), (i) (1) (d), (i) (2), (i) (1) and (i) (1) (b) and (r) (1) thereof, 
Whereas detailed rules of application of Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 must be adopted to provide essential clarifications of the principles laid down in the abovementioned Regulation and supplementary rules thereto; 
Whereas these clarifications and additional rules should in the first instance take account of the criteria followed when Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 itself was adopted; whereas it is also appropriate to use as a basis the traditions and customs of the various Community regions, at least insofar as these are compatible with the single market; whereas another criterion should be that of avoiding all possible sources of confusion in the information given on labels and guaranteeing that the consumer is given the fullest and clearest information possible where labelling is concerned; 
Whereas this Regulation should apply without prejudice to the transitional provisions provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3773/89 of 14 December 1989 laying down transitional measures relating to spirituous beverages (2); 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the implementation Committee for Spirit Drinks,
