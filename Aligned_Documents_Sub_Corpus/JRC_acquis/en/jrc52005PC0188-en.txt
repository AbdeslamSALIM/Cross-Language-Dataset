Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on a Community position in the Association Council on the implementation of Article 67 and Article 80 of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, on one part, and the Arab Republic of Egypt, of the other part 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. The association agreement form the legal basis of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Egypt. 
2. The Euro-Med Association Agreement with Egypt entered into force on 1 June 2004 and envisages the establishment of a free trade area between the EU and Egypt before 31 December 2015 (for a restricted number of goods before 31 December 2018). The establishment of this free trade area contributes to strengthening the integration of the economic, institutional and social systems of the partner countries on the basis of approved legal instruments. 
3. The Association Agreement envisages, in its Article 80, the constitution of the bodies necessary for its implementation. Article 67 of the agreement envisages for its part the creation of a working group instructed to evaluate the application of the provisions concerning the cooperation on migration as well as on social and consular affairs. 
4. An institutional structure formed by a number of sub-committees was established for the implementation of other Euro-Mediterranean partner countries, such as Morocco, Tunisia and Jordan. The present proposal follows the same scheme and structure. 
5. Egypt is willing to strengthen cooperation in the various fields covered by the provisions of the association agreement. Moreover, under the European Neighbourhood Policy, the bilateral relations between the EU and Egypt will develop to take the form of an overall partnership having a coherent approach, which has to be guaranteed by close and permanent coordination of the various parts concerned. 
6. With this in mind, the European Commission proposes to the Council the constitution of a working group responsible for migration, social and consular affairs, as the Association Agreement envisages, and of seven sub-committees intended to help the Association Council and Committee for the implementation of the Agreement. These sub-committees will consider the questions of a technical nature that are not possible to treat completely within the framework of the Association Committee. 
7. The working group and the seven sub-committees of which we propose the creation will be entitled respectively: i) working group on migration, social and consular affairs, ii) internal market, iii) industry, trade, services and investment, iv) transport, environment and energy, v) information society, research, audiovisual, education and culture vi) agriculture and fisheries, vii) justice and security and viii) customs cooperation. 
8. As regards their organisation, the subcommittees will be chaired by the Commission pursuant to the Council decision of 25 March 2002. Under that decision, the "Justice and security" subcommittee will be chaired, insofar as the EU is concerned, according to the same rules as apply to the Association Committee. In the event that the subject of the discussion is outside the Community competencies a representative of the Council Presidency will chair the Committee and the position of the Member States. In the latter case, the Commission will be fully associated in the preparatory work and in the definition of the objectives of the meetings of the sub-committees. 
9. The objective, the subjects covered by each sub-committee and the implementing procedures are contained in the rules of procedure annexed.
