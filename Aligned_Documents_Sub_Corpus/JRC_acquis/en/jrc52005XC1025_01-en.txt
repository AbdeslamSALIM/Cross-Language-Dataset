(Text with EEA relevance) 
1. The United Kingdom has decided to modify the public service obligations in respect of the scheduled air services between the Orkney Mainland (Kirkwall) and the islands of Papa Westray and North Ronaldsay as set out in the Notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities C 394/04 of 30 December 1997, as modified in the Official Journal of the European Communities/Union C 369/2 of 22 December 2000, C 363/06 of 19 December 2001, C 295/09 of 5 December 2003 and C 306/07 of 10 December 2004 pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes. 
2. The modified public service obligations are as follows: 
— Minimum frequencies: 
- to Papa Westray: 3 return frequencies during the summer timetable and 2 return frequencies during the winter timetable on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday; 2 return frequencies on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday all year round; and one return frequency on Sunday all year round; 
- to North Ronaldsay: 3 return frequencies during the summer timetable and 2 return frequencies during the winter timetable on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday; and 2 return frequencies on Tuesday all year round. 
— Capacity: 
The capacity of the aircraft used should be not less than 8 passenger seats on each route. 
— Fares: 
The price of a single adult fare must not exceed GBP 15 on each route. 
The maximum fare on each route may be increased once a year with the prior written consent of Orkney Islands Council in line with the United Kingdom's Retail Price Index (all items) or any successor index to this. 
No other changes may be made to the fare levels without the prior written consent of Orkney Islands Council. 
The new maximum fare on each route must be notified to the Civil Aviation Authority and will not enter into force prior to their notification to the European Commission which may then publish them in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
Under Orkney Islands Council's Concessionary Fares Scheme, established under the Transport Act 1985, there are 12 free return journeys per year for those eligible between Papa Westray/North Ronaldsay and Kirkwall. These fares will be invoiced monthly to the Council and will be separate to the tender subsidy.
