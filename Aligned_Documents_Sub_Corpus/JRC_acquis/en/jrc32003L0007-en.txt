Commission Directive 2003/7/EC 
of 24 January 2003 
amending the conditions for authorisation of canthaxanthin in feedingstuffs in accordance with Council Directive 70/524/EEC 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1756/2002(2), and in particular Article 9r thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Under Directive 70/524/EEC the additive canthaxanthin is authorised under certain conditions. 
(2) In 1997 the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) concluded the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of canthaxanthin for humans could be set at 0,03 mg/kg of body weight. 
(3) In the light of the SCF's revision of the ADI, the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition (SCAN) reviewed levels of canthaxanthin in feed for salmonids, broilers and laying hens to ensure consumer safety. SCAN has stated that consumer safety would be assured by setting maximum canthaxanthin concentrations of 25 mg/kg of feed for salmonids and broilers and at 8 mg/kg of feed for laying hens. 
(4) The current canthaxanthin authorisations need to be amended to provide greater protection for consumers' health. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
