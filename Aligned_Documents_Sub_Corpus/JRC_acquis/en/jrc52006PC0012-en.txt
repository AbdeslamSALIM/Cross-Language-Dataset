Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 
on the exemption from taxes of imports of small consignments of goods of a non-commercial character from third countries 
(presented by the Commission) (Codified version) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. In the context of a people’s Europe, the Commission attaches great importance to simplifying and clarifying Community law so as to make it clearer and more accessible to the ordinary citizen, thus giving him new opportunities and the chance to make use of the specific rights it gives him. 
This aim cannot be achieved so long as numerous provisions that have been amended several times, often quite substantially, remain scattered, so that they must be sought partly in the original instrument and partly in later amending ones. Considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules. 
For this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if Community law is to be clear and transparent. 
2. On 1 April 1987 the Commission therefore decided[1] to instruct its staff that all legislative acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that the Community rules are clear and readily understandable. 
3. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. 
Codification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal Community legislative procedure. 
Given that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification , the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. 
4. The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 78/1035/EEC of 19 December 1978 on the exemption from taxes of imports of small consignments of goods of a non-commercial character from third countries[3]. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it[4]; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. 
5. The codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation , in all official languages, of Directive 78/1035/EEC and the instruments amending it, carried out by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, by means of a data-processing system . Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table contained in Annex II to the codified Directive.

Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 
on the exemption from taxes of imports of small consignments of goods of a non-commercial character from third countries 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article Ö 93 Õ thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament[5], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[6], 
Whereas: 
ê 
(1) Council Directive 78/1035/EEC of 19 December 1978 on the exemption from taxes of imports of small consignments of goods of a non-commercial character from third countries[7] has been substantially amended several times[8]. In the interests of clarity and rationality, the said Directive should be codified. 
ê 78/1035/EEC (adapted) 
(2) Provision should be made for the exemption from turnover taxes and excise duties of imports of small consignments of a similar nature from third countries. 
ê 78/1035/EEC (adapted) 
(3) To that end the limits within which such exemption is to be applied should, for practical reasons, be as far as possible the same as those laid down for the Community arrangements for exemption from customs duties in Council Regulation (EEC) No Ö 918/83 of 28 March 1983[9] Õ. 
ê 78/1035/EEC 
(4) Finally it appears necessary to set special limits for certain products because of the high level of taxation to which they are at present subject in the Member States. 
ê 
(5) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex I, Part B, 
ê 78/1035/EEC
