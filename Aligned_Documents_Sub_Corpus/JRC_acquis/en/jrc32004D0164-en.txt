THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed(1), as last amended by Directive 2003/61/EC(2), and in particular Article 17, paragraph 1 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Pursuant to Commission Decision 2004/130/EC(3), the marketing in the Community of seed of spring field beans which does not satisfy the minimum germination requirements laid down in Directive 66/401/EEC was authorised in accordance with defined terms and subject to certain conditions for a period expiring on 15 February 2004.

(3) Consequently, the authorisation should be extended and Decision 2004/130/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,
