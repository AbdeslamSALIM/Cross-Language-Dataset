COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 1999/102/EC 
of 15 December 1999 
adapting to technical progress Council Directive 70/220/EEC relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 70/220/EEC of 20 March 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles(1), as last amended by Directive 98/69/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 5 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Directive 70/220/EEC is one of the separate directives under the type-approval procedure laid down by Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(3), as last amended by Directive 98/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(4). 
(2) Directive 70/220/EEC lays down the specifications for the testing of emissions of the motor vehicles covered by its scope. In view of the recent experience gained and the rapidly developing state of the art of on-board diagnostic (OBD) systems, it is appropriate to adapt those specifications accordingly with effect from the dates specified in Directive 98/69/EC. 
(3) It is necessary to clarify the dates of application of the OBD requirements of this Directive for new types and all types of vehicles of category M1 equipped with compression-ignition engines and the maximum mass of which exceeds 2500 kg and for vehicles in category N1 classes II and III. 
(4) It is appropriate to clarify the OBD requirements in relation to tamper prevention, disablement of engine misfire monitoring during certain operating conditions, the storage of distance travelled by the vehicle while a malfunction is indicated to the driver through the malfunction indicator, the capability of the OBD system to perform bi-directional logic control, the use of the P1 and P0 fault code sets of ISO 15031-6, the diagnostic connector and to express the OBD threshold limits to two decimal places. It is appropriate to introduce revised provisions for misfire monitoring under conditions likely to cause catalyst damage to reduce the possibility of false fault indications and to introduce the possibility of partial catalyst volume monitoring and the use of the enhanced on-board to off-board communications link provided by controller area network (CAN). 
(5) It is appropriate to allow the type-approval of vehicles with OBD systems that contain a limited number of minor deficiencies that may arise at, or prior to the time of type-approval or are discovered when vehicles are already in service. The type-approval authority may also issue an extension to the type-approval certificate for vehicles that have already been type-approved in cases where deficiencies are subsequently found within the OBD system on vehicles in-service. Such extensions may not be issued if there is a complete lack of monitoring capability. A period should be specified within which deficiencies authorised by the authority must be corrected on future manufactured vehicles. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Directive 70/156/EEC, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
