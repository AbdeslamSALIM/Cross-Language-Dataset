on the issuing of export licences for wine-sector products 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 883/2001 of 24 April 2001, laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards trade with third countries in products in the wine sector [1], and in particular Article 7 and Article 9(3) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 63(7) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine [2], limits the grant of export refunds for wine-sector products to the volumes and expenditure contained in the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations. 
(2) Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 883/2001 lays down the conditions under which the Commission may take specific measures to prevent an overrun of the quantity laid down or the budget available under the said Agreement. 
(3) On the basis of information on export licence applications available to the Commission on 22 February 2006, the quantity still available for the period until 15 March 2006, for destination zone (4) western Europe, referred to in Article 9(5) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2001, could be exceeded unless the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund is restricted. Therefore, a single percentage for the acceptance of applications submitted from 15 to 21 February 2006 should be applied and the submission of applications and the issue of licences suspended for this zone until 16 March 2006, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
