of 11 May 1983 
setting up a Committee on Community Policy regarding Forestry and Forestry-based Industries 
(83/247/EEC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Whereas the constant improvement of living and working conditions and the harmonious development of economic activities within the Member States are objectives of the European Economic Community; 
Whereas the economic activities based on the production and industrial processing of wood can contribute towards the attainment of these objectives, having regard to the development potential of these activities and taking into account their present difficulties; 
Whereas these difficulties should be examined and resolved not separately but in the light of their interrelationships; 
Whereas, to this end, and on the basis of the work already carried out by the Commission departments and in particular the communication to the Council embodying a Community action programme relating to forestry and forest-based industries, close and continuous contacts with the economic sectors concerned can help to achieve these goals; 
Whereas the most appropriate way of organizing such contacts is to set up, under the auspices of the Commission, an Advisory Committee on Community Policy regarding Forestry and Forest-based Industries on which these sectors will be represented; whereas, moreover, provision should be made for the presence on the Committee of qualified persons who can bring to the Committee their technical expertise in and knowledge of the wood economy at Community level,
