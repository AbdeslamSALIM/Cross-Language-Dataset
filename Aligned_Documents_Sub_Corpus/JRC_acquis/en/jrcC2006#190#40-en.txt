Action brought on 5 April 2006 — INET ELLAS — ELEKTRONIKI IPIRESIA PLIROFORION E.P.E. 
v Commission of the European Communities 
Parties 
Applicant: INET HELLAS — ELEKTRONIKI IPIRESIA PLIROFORION E.P.E. (Athens, Greece) (represented by: B. Khatzopoulos, lawyer) 
Defendant: Commission of the European Communities 
Form of order sought 
The Court is asked to: 
- annul European Commission document No. INFSO/A3/VS D(2006)703641/ 31.1.2006; 
- order the defendant to pay the costs. 
Pleas in law and main arguments 
The applicant maintains that the contested document is unlawful because it wrongly assumes that registration of the domain name co.eu. on the Web is prohibited by the rules of Community law. In fact, however, no Community provision prohibits registration of the domain name co.eu. To the contrary, Regulation No 40/94 requires its registration.
