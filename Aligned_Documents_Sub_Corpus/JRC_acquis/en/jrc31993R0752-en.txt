This requirement may be replaced, where appropriate and at the discretion of the competent authorities, by a detailed list of the cultural goods. 
3. The competent authorities may require, for the purposes of issuing an export licence, the physical presentation of the cultural goods to be exported. 
4. Any costs incurred by the application of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be met by the applicant requesting the export licence.

3. The authorization form, which shall be returned to the issuing authority, must accompany the consignment to the customs office at the point of exit from the Community. The customs office shall, if necessary, fill in box 5 of the form and affix its stamp to box 22, and return it to the holder of the export licence or his authorized representative in order that the form may be sent back to the issuing authority. 
Article 9 
1. The period of validity of export licences shall not exceed twelve months from the date of issue.
