of 22 December 2005 
fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2006 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy [1], and in particular Article 20 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas [2], and in particular Article 2 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 requires the Council to adopt the measures necessary to ensure access to waters and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities, taking account of available scientific advice and, in particular, the report prepared by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries. 
(2) Under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, it is incumbent upon the Council to establish fishing opportunity limits by fishery or group of fisheries and the allocation of these opportunities to Member States. 
(3) In order to ensure effective management of the fishing opportunities, the specific conditions under which fishing operations are carried out should be established. 
(4) The principles and certain procedures for fishery management need to be laid down at Community level, so that Member States can ensure the management of the vessels flying their flag. 
(5) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 lays down definitions of relevance for the allocation of fishing opportunities. 
(6) In accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96, the stocks that are subject to the various measures referred to therein need to be identified. 
(7) Fishing opportunities should be used in accordance with the Community legislation on the subject, and in particular with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1381/87 of 20 May 1987 establishing detailed rules concerning the marking and documentation of fishing vessels [3], Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2807/83 of 22 September 1983 laying down detailed rules for recording information on Member States' catches of fish [4], Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy [5], Commission Regulation (EC) No 2244/2003 of 18 December 2003 laying down detailed provisions regarding satellite-based Vessel Monitoring Systems [6], Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 of 22 September 1986 defining characteristics for fishing vessels [7], Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 of 17 December 1991 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in the north-east Atlantic [8], and Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21 December 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound [9]. 
(8) In order to contribute to the conservation of fish stocks, certain supplementary measures on control and technical conditions of fishing should be implemented in 2006. 
(9) In order to ensure the livelihood of Community fishermen and avoid endangering resources and any possible difficulty due to the lapsing of Regulation (EC) No 27/2005, it is important to open these fisheries on 1 January 2006. Given the urgency of the matter, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in paragraph I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities,

2.11.2. Before 31 January 2006, Member States concerned shall make available to the Commission and other Member States bordering the Baltic Sea on its official website the national control action programme referred to in point 2.11.1, together with an implementation schedule. 
2.11.3. The Commission shall convene a meeting of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture to evaluate the compliance with and results of the national control action programmes for cod stocks in the Baltic Sea. 
3. Restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot 
3.1. The retention on board of the following species of fish which are caught within the geographical areas and during the periods mentioned below shall be prohibited: 
Species | Geographical area | Period | 
Flounder (Platichthys flesus) | Subdivisions 26 to 28, 29 south of 59o30'N Subdivision 32 | 15 February to 15 May 15 February to 31 May | 
Turbot (Psetta maxima) | Subdivisions 25 to 26, 28 south of 58o50'N | 1 June to 31 July | 
3.2. By way of derogation from point 3.1, when fishing with trawls, Danish seines and similar gears with a mesh size equal to or greater then 105 mm or with gillnets, entangling nets or trammel nets with a mesh size equal to or greater than 100 mm, by-catches of flounder and turbot may be retained on board and landed within a limit of 10 % by live weight of the total catch retained on board and landed during the periods of prohibition referred to in that point.

Appendix 1 to Annex III 
Common rules for national control programmes 
Objective 
1. Each Member State shall set specific inspection benchmarks in accordance with the aims set out in this Appendix. 
Strategy 
2. Inspection and surveillance of fishing activities shall concentrate on vessels likely to catch cod. Random inspections of transport and marketing of cod shall be used as a complementary cross-checking mechanism to test the effectiveness of inspection and surveillance. 
Priorities 
3. Different gear types shall be subject to different levels of inspection, depending on the extent to which the fleets are affected by fishing opportunity limits. For that reason, each Member State shall set specific priorities. 
Target benchmarks 
4. Not later than one month from the date of entry into force of this Regulation, Member States shall implement their inspection schedules with the aim of attaining the targets set out below: 
(a) Level of inspection in ports 
As a general rule, inspections shall aim to cover 20 % by weight of cod landings covering all places of landing. 
Alternatively: 
(i) inspections shall be undertaken at such frequency with the aim that during a three-month period a number of Community vessels that account for 20 % or more by weight of cod landings are inspected at least once; 
(ii) this may be based on a simple random sampling or by using an appropriate sampling plan which would achieve at least the same level of accuracy. 
(b) Level of inspection of marketing 
Inspection of 5 % of the quantities of cod offered for sale at auction. 
(c) Level of inspection at sea 
Flexible benchmark: to be set after a detailed analysis of the fishing activity in each area. Benchmarks at sea shall refer the number of patrol days at sea in the cod management areas, with possibly a separate benchmark for days patrolling specific areas. 
(d) Level of aerial surveillance 
Flexible benchmark: to be set after a detailed analysis of the fishing activity conducted in each area and taking the available resources at the Member State's disposal into consideration.
