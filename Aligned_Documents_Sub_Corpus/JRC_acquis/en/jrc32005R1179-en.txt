correcting Regulation (EC) No 990/2005 establishing the standard import values for determining the entry price of certain fruit and vegetables 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables [1], 
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 of 21 December 1994 on detailed rules for the application of the import arrangements for fruit and vegetables [2], and in particular Article 4(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 990/2005 [3] established, inter alia, the standard import values for determining the entry price of lemons. 
(2) A check has revealed an error in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 990/2005 concerning lemons originating in Argentina. The Regulation in question should therefore be corrected. 
(3) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 specifies that, where no standard import value is in force for a product for a given origin, the average of standard import values in force for that product shall apply. That average should therefore be recalculated if one of its component standard import values is corrected. 
(4) Application of the corrected standard import value must be requested by the party concerned so that they are not placed retroactively at a disadvantage,
