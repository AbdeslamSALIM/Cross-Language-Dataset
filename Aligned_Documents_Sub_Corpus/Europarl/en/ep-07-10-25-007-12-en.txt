      - Before the vote on Amendment 1
    
    
      
        (FR) Mr President, colleagues, I should like very briefly to propose an oral amendment to the new Article 61a in Amendment 1, which would introduce the following wording in the second part: 'therefore calls on the Commission [...] to find solutions while continuing negotiations'.
        I believe I have the support of my ALDE and PPE colleagues.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was adopted.)
