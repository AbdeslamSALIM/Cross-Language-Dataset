      Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        (FR) Mr President, I would like to ask for a separate vote on Amendment 18 because it deals with the Agency's seat.
        I am thus calling for a separate vote.
      
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - Mr President, I object to this request.
        This report is a package which has been agreed amongst the groups.
        I do not think it is appropriate to make a request after the deadline and to open up the package in this way, so I ask my colleagues to join me in objecting to this.
      
      
        (Parliament rejected the request)
