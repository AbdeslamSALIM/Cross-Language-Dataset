      Common organisation of the market in cereals (vote)
    
    
      - Glattfelder report
    
    
      - Before the vote on the proposal of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development:
    
    
      
        Mr President, could you make it entirely clear that it is rejected on the recommendation of the rapporteur, not the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
        I make no further statement.
      
    
    
      
        It is the recommendation of the rapporteur to reject the Commission proposal.
        Those wishing to follow the rapporteur must now cast a negative vote.
