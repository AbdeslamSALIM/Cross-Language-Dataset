        (PL) Madam President, excuse me, but I would just like to explain my voting on the report on Macedonia, if that is possible.
      
    
    
      
        Mr Rogalski, you were not on the list, and I have closed the explanations of vote.
        I am sorry.
        Next time, please let us know within the prescribed time.
        I would also point out to you that you can explain your vote in writing.
      
      
        (The sitting was suspended at 12.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
