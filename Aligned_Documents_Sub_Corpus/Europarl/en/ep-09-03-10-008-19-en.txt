      Before the vote on paragraph 8:
    
    
      
        Mr President, I just want to point out - since hungry Mr Beazley made a point about the roll-call votes - that, on the following report, every roll-call vote was requested by the PPE-DE Group.
        So much for that one!
      
    
    
      
        And Mr Beazley is a very devout member of the PPE-DE Group!
      
      
        (Laughter)
      
      
        That concludes the vote.
