      - After the vote:
    
    
      
        (DE) Mr President, I refer to the relevant rule of the Rules of Procedure.
        A few months ago, we voted on the Bauer report, and afterwards I wrote seeking clarification of how we should be voting on amendments to reports.
      
      
        There is no doubt that we need a qualified majority in the final vote if we are to call on the Commission to take legislative action, but I fail to see why we also need a qualified majority beforehand for amendments.
        Unfortunately, I have yet to receive a reply.
      
      
        We have now had another such report on the agenda.
        I would be grateful if the services could clarify this.
      
    
    
      
        Mr Caspary, I have just been informed that a reply regarding the Bauer report is on its way to you.
        I hope that it will reach you before Christmas.
