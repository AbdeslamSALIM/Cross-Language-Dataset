        The next item is the vote.
      
      
        (For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)
      
      
      
        I have an announcement to make.
        Ms Eva Dudzinska is sitting to the right of me.
        She has spent almost 35 years in the European Parliament.
        For the last 10 years her activities have been closely linked to the plenary.
        She is now retiring.
        I would like to thank her and wish her all the best for the future.
      
      
        (Applause)
