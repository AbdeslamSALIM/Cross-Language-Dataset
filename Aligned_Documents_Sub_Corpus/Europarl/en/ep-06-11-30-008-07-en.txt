      Fundamental Rights Agency - activities under Title VI of the EU Treaty (vote)
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, my report called for extending the competence of the Agency for Fundamental Rights to the third pillar.
        I ask my fellow Members to continue to support this recommendation, and to vote for Parliament's original proposal.
        For my part, I have taken note that the political declaration contains this proposal to a slightly limited degree.
