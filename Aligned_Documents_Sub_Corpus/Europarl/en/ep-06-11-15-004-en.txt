        Mr Rack has the floor for a point of order.
      
    
    
      
        (DE) Mr President, if I have understood correctly, the President should preside over the vote.
        He has more than a dozen deputies.
        If he is really unable to attend, one of these deputies should at least be present.
      
    
    
      
        No, Mr Rack.
        It was I who was responsible for chairing Voting Time.
        The reason I was slightly late was that I was at the airport receiving the Emir of Qatar, and there was a slight delay on the journey there and back.
      
      
        The next item is the vote.
      
      
        (For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
