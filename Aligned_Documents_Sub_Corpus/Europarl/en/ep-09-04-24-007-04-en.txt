      - After the vote
    
    
      
        Madam President, a vote was defeated because there was an equal number of votes just a couple of moments ago.
        A Member has made a very serious allegation about voting in the Chamber.
        I would ask you to halt proceedings until we find out whether there are Members voting who should not be voting, or whether this allegation is false.
        It is a very serious allegation.
      
      
        (Applause)
      
    
    
      
        I have just said that it will be verified.
        That means that it will be verified immediately.
        We are dealing with it.
      
    
    
      
        - (FR) Madam President, I will be very brief on this point.
        As one of our fellow Members has made an accusation, I will ask him to clarify his accusation.
        As you said, the verification needs to take place immediately, and if, as I believe, it turns out after verification that the accusation is false, I ask that all the conclusions be drawn from this.
      
    
    
      
        I said that the verification would be done.
        It is going to be done immediately, so I will keep you informed in the next few minutes.
