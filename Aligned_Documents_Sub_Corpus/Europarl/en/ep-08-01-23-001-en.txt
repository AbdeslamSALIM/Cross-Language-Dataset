        I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 17 January 2008.
      
      
        The sitting cannot begin until 12.30 p.m., because the President of the Commission is unable to be present any earlier.
        It is therefore scheduled to end at 2 p.m.
      
      
        (The sitting was suspended at 12.05 p.m. and resumed at 12.30 p.m.)
