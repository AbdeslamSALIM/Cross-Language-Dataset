      - After the vote on paragraph 6:
    
    
      
        (PL) My voting mechanism failed to work on five occasions during the roll-call vote.
        I realised this and tried to ask for the floor but was not permitted to speak.
        That was not right.
        In addition, there was no interpretation into Polish for a certain time, and that was not dealt with either.
        I would ask that we cease to be treated in this way.
      
    
    
      
        Mrs Tomaszewska, I am terribly sorry that your vote was not counted.
        I hope that this will not happen again.
        Please submit your vote here, and then it will be correctly registered, and your view will go on record for posterity.
