      Sakharov Prize (vote)
    
    
      - After the vote:
    
    
      
        Mr President, I received this information too late to add it to the resolution.
        Mr Gao Zhisheng, a distinguished human rights attorney in Beijing who was arrested in August, has been tried secretly this week and imprisoned.
        I am sure the House would wish to express its regret at that news, part of a continued crackdown on human rights activists in China.
      
      
        (Applause)
