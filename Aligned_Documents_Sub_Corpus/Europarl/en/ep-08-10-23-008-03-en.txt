      Piracy at sea (
    
    
      - On paragraph 4 part 2
    
    
      
        (ES) Mr President, I refer to the first part of paragraph 4 in the split voting.
        I should like the vote on the first part of the original paragraph to be repeated.
      
    
    
      
        I can see that the House agrees.
        We will vote on this again.
