        I wish to make an announcement to my honourable friends.
        It was with huge relief that we heard the news that the death penalty on Mr Mirza-Tahir Hussain, a British subject detained in Pakistan, has been commuted.
      
      
        The President of the European Parliament and the Members of the House made huge efforts to save Mr Mirza-Tahir Hussain's life.
        In this particular case, we are all in a position to welcome the fact that the message sent by Parliament was heard.
      
      
        (Loud applause)
