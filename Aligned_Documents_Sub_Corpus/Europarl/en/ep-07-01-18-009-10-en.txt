      Equality between men and women in the committees' work (vote)
    
    
      - Before the vote on paragraph 6
    
    
      
        (NL) Mr President, the rapporteur has asked me to withdraw the split vote, which we applied for in respect of paragraph 6, and instead, to opt for an oral amendment which amounts to replacing 'gender perspectives' by 'equal treatment of men and women'.
        I am happy to grant Mrs Záborská this request.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was accepted)
      
    
    
      
        That concludes the vote.
