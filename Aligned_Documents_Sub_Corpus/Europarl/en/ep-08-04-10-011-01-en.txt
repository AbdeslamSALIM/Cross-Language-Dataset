      Combating cancer in the enlarged European Union (vote)
    
    
      - Before the vote on Amendment 2
    
    
      
        Mr President, cancer may cause chronic illness and can possibly lead to disability, therefore in order to make new paragraph 34a more accurate and more credible I propose an oral amendment to include the words 'may include' and 'possibly' in the appropriate areas in that subparagraph.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was accepted)
