      EU strategy towards Belarus (vote)
    
    
      Before the vote - concerns paragraph 9:
    
    
      
        We propose to delete the last sentence of paragraph 9, which reads: 'calls on the Belarusian authorities to end their practice of issuing exit visas to their citizens, in particular, children and students'.
        We want to delete this because the authorities have already abolished this system of exit visas, so it is obsolete.
