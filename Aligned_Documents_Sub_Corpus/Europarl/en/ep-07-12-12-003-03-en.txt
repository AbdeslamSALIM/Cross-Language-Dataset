      Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (vote)
    
    
      - Report: Reimer Böge
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, may I ask you to ensure that Members are seated for the vote, because we need the prescribed majorities.
        That is very important for the next three reports, otherwise there will be a problem tomorrow with the vote on the budget for 2008.
        I therefore request that you ask my fellow Members kindly to sit down and take part in the vote, otherwise we shall have a serious problem.
      
    
    
      
        Thank you, Mr Böge, you are absolutely right.
        Can I ask those colleagues who are not yet sitting down to please come and take their seats.
        We have roll-call votes which require a qualified majority; they are important votes.
        Please, can you go to your seats?
