      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - Madam President, I will be very brief.
        I would just like to thank my colleagues and to recommend a positive vote in the assent procedure.
        However, I would love to have Commissioner Ashton's confirmation again on the points we raised during our debate on Monday - specifically, Commissioner, when you committed yourself to giving the same preferences to Côte d'Ivoire that you had already accepted for SADC.
        You are nodding - perfect!
        Thank you so much.
      
    
    
      
        - We have agreement, so we will continue with the vote.
