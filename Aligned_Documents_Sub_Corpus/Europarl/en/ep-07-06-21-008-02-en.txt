        (DE) Mr President, I think we should congratulate Mr Fruteau on his election to the French Parliament.
        It may not be good news for us, but I am sure he is very pleased with the result.
      
    
    
      
        I too would like to congratulate Mr Fruteau, and we now go on to the next item.
