      - After the vote on Amendment 19:
    
    
      
        on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to speak before the vote.
        I am speaking under Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure.
        Given that our Amendment 19 is the same as Amendment 1 from the PPE-DE Group, the UEN Group withdraws its amendment and would like to co-sign Amendment 1 of the European People's Party and European Democrats.
