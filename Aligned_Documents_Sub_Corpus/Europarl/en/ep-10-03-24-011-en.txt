  
    
      Welcome
    
    
      
        I have some special information for you.
        I would like to extend a warm welcome to the delegation from the Pan-African Parliament, led by its Vice-President, Mrs Mugyenyi.
        They are with us at our sitting.
        Please welcome them.
      
      
        (Applause)
      
      
        The second Vice-President of the Pan-African Parliament and Chair of the Delegation for relations with the European Parliament.
        Our Parliaments work closely together, and your presence with us today gives us great pleasure.
      
      
        I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for the invitation for me to address the sitting of the Pan-African Parliament which will be held in three weeks' time.
        Unfortunately, I will not be able to be there, but I will send you a letter on that occasion.
        I am sure we will have the opportunity to meet again.
      
      
        Once again, I warmly welcome you all.
