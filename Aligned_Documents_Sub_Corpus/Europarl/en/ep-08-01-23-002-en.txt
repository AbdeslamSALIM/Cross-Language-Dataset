        We welcome the ACP members of the Presidency of the ΑCP-ΕU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and their delegations.
      
      
        At this extraordinary sitting we are to debate an issue of global importance, since climate change and the energy issues associated with it are common challenges for the European Union as well as for all the peoples of the world.
