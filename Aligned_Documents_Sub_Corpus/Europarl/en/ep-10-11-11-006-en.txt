        Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, today is Armistice Day, when we commemorate hostilities coming to an end in the First World War.
        Therefore, in order to commemorate the armistice that brought an end to the First World War, we are going to observe a minute's silence in memory of the millions of Europeans who lost their lives in that struggle.
