        rapporteur. - Mr President, I would just like to propose an oral amendment to my Amendment 2, to clarify the text.
      
      
        I propose to delete the word 'unacceptable'.
        Therefore, it would read: 'in clear infringement of the fundamental rights laid down in the European Union Treaties'.
        The political groups have already been informed.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was adopted.)
