      On the vote on Amendment 5:
    
    
      
        (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to ask for an electronic check of Amendment 5.
      
    
    
      
        Madam President, I think that, after the results of these previous votes and because we need a qualified majority, as a democratic requirement, we should repeat the vote on Amendment 5.
      
      
        (Applause)
