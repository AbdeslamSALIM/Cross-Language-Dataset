        (DE) Mr President, at yesterday's late-night sitting, Mrs McCarthy had a weapon here in Parliament.
        I should like to ask who gave permission for a weapon to be brought into the chamber.
      
    
    
      
        That is a good question.
        I will refer the matter to the relevant authorities and they will let you know.
