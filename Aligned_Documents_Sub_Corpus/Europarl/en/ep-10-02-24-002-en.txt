        Let me welcome the President of the European Council, Mr Herman Van Rompuy, to the plenary session of the European Parliament for the first time.
        We welcome you and congratulate you once again, Mr President.
      
      
        (Applause)
      
      
        I would also like to welcome President Barroso.
        Over the last five years, it has been quite usual for you to sit here; it is not the first time for you at all!
