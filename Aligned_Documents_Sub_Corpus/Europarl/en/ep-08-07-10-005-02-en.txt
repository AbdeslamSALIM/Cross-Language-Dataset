        Madam President, I would appreciate support for the following minor change in the text where it reads: 'The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon will impose closer interinstitutional cooperation'.
        I would appreciate it if colleagues, for understandable reasons, agreed to change that to: 'The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon would, if ratified, impose closer interinstitutional cooperation'.
