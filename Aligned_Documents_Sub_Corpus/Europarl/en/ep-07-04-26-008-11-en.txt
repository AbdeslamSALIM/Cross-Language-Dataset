      Homophobia in Europe (vote)
    
    
      - Motion for a resolution:
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        (DE) Mr President, before we vote, I would like to make a brief observation.
        In terms of semantics, the content of the resolution does not correspond to the concept of homophobia.
        The word in the title has been incorrectly used.
      
      
        - Before the vote on paragraph 12a:
      
    
    
      
        Mr President, following the debate on the Commission statement, we would like to update the motion for a resolution by adding a new paragraph 12a which would read: 'Welcomes the fact that the European Commission has started the procedure for a new directive that would enlarge the scope of Directive 2000/78/EC on equal treatment in employment and social occupation to include areas of discrimination outside the labour market;'.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was not accepted)
