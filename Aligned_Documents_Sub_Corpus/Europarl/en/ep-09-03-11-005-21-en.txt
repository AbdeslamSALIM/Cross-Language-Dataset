      Combating climate change (vote)
    
    
      Before the vote on paragraph 20:
    
    
      
        Madam President, a very brief amendment to the original text.
        Paragraph 20, line 3 should read: 'reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation'.
        At the moment, it reads 'reducing emissions for deforestation and degradation'.
        I want to change the word 'for' to 'from'.
        In the English version it is wrong.
        This is not contentious.
