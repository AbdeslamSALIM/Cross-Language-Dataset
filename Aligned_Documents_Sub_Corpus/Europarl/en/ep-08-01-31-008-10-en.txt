      - Before the vote on the motion for a resolution
    
    
      
        Mr President, I rise under Rule 151(3) to ask whether we have legitimacy, in fact, to vote on this.
        I had the pleasure of your company last evening at 5 o'clock, when the temperature in your office was 80Â°F. This whole building is overheated.
        The building in Strasbourg is overheated, and I would suggest that we put our own house in order before we start voting on other things.
      
    
    
      
        I have not felt this heat.
        Perhaps this had something to do with your inner reality.
