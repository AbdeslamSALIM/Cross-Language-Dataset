excellent. a remarkable debut. there must be a gene for music. although izia music is very different from his father jacques. music inspired in every sense of the term. found undoubtedly influences but not copying (led zeppelin? janis joplin? etc..). izia's voice is beautiful, the musicians provide that say? rock, good, listen completely.
