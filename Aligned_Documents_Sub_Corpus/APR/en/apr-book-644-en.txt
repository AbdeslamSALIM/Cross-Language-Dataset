fan of the series i did discover a good number of friends i plussois the comments already posted: also disappointing that the book 7. it is light years away from the plot of the temple of the winds, and miles of battles of earlier volumes. as much as i loved the first volume of engineering thinking very well transcribed by the author on the hero, as the ac becomes tiresome. i read not to miss information 'capitals' for volumes to come but on this one i own is a lot of pages to say nothing. the story would have been nice if he had withdrawn half of the existing pages to put a little rytme in his work. in short a book worthy of its tv adaptation 'the legend of the seeker' set to disappoint all the fans.
