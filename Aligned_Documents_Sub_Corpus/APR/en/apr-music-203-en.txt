is undoubtedly their best album, too often eclipsed by the great neanmois "dark side of the moon" in 1973 ... syd barrett (vocals, guitar) is a genius probably too fragile for this world oppression ... but he left us is testimony to his vision ... it was as musically accessible to all his dreams ... the album in him even sounds like a waking dream ... and there are few who issues such a goldsmiths of psychedelic ... ranging from the extraterrestrial "astronomy domine" the little rhyme typical english "bike" (making me think of the first blur) ... they change their style but the magic is here ... and "scarecrow" or "chapter 24" are among the best tracks of psychedelic pop that struck earth ...
