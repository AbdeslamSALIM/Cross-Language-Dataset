there were all kinds to make a great novel, unfamiliar cultures, history and places very rich characters, a priori interesting ... and it failed. the writing is uninteresting, dull action. the whole constellation of sex scenes a bit incongruous (the author was bored there too?). at the end of the story i vaguely interested, but too vague to push me to buy volume 2, j ' i fear to die of boredom. too bad.
