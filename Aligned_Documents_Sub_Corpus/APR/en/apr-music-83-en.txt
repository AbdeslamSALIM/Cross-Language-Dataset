i loved the 1st album was really a gem. everything was the voice, style, tunes. that's why i bought the 2nd eyes closed. and ... what a disappointment .. but what a disappointment! i even checked the bag has twice asked me if i had bought paolo nutini. apart from the song "candy" the rest is really not up. a vague mix of country music, rock and roll elvis to see a little stroll "western" ... paolo sorry but there ....
