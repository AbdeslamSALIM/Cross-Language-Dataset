here is a wonderful retrospective of the work of songwriter doc pomus and mort shuman. here we find some pearls composed mostly between 1958 and 1967 (the date of the end for their collaboration). some rarities compilation this Ã©grennent also because many titles are published for the first time on cd. only strangeness, the inclusion of double trouble by elvis presley (last song composed for the king by the duo), which is very far from their greater success for elvis presley. it feels good breathlessness on the latest creative compositions although pomus / shuman is one of the duets songwriter who had the greatest success between 1959 and 1964. "double trouble / twice as much as anybody else, oh yeah!"
