this latest collection is reserved for fans. eager to know a sequel, i waited for the paperback version for lack of financial resources and bof the book does not "devour" like no other! the magic no longer operating, we guess that the end is fairly predictable. a book to readers of previous volumes, which remain to me of great moments in reading the contemporary u.s. literature.
