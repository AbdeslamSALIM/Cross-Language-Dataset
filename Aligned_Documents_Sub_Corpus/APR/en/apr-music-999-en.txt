if a teen wants to start a rock collection, it must start it by this album, a jewel of the british crown. everything has been said about the fabulous four musicians of this legendary band, but why not go into raptures even today on a song like "whole lotta love" or cries torn and enjoyment plant still make you shudder as the dawn of the 70s. "what is and what should never be" which alternates between quiet passages and violence of the drum of the deceased bonham. no one under unequal or lower than another. it emerges from all perfection, homogeneity on the musical as a whole generation of guitarists have taken so needy on their sleeves. a masterpiece, simply. "thank you".
