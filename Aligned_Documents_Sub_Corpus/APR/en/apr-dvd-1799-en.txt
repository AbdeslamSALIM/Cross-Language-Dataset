this film is not zero but we can not say it is good. i saw jenifer aniston is very good. the history is agreed, there is no rebound, the end comes suddenly with little warning and yet i am not bored, i would not explain why. the actors are all good there are some good replicas, but it really is not the must-see film. a film that forgets quickly and does nothing.
