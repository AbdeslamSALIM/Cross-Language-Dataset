new york 1997 blu-ray is a real disaster, it is amazing that a publisher can release a movie on blu-ray to take a picture of a poor quality dvd with a soundtrack swollen artificially. the image is atrocious and the sound is not better. what is certain is that it is not with the blu-ray as bad bill that this support will take off. a carefully avoided.
