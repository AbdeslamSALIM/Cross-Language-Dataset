this book is dangerous for babies and their parents. ms. solter develops theories hazardous baseless and can push a young mother in doubt leave her crying baby rather than attempting to comfort by every means. the worst is that it may also sow doubt in the mind of a mother for whom everything goes well and whose child does not cry very rarely. a baby is fine, does not need crying or shouting, no offense to ms. solter. this book should be avoided if one wants to meet her child and that it is its well-being.
