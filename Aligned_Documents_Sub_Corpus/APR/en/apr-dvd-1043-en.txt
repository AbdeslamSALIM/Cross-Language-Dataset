and yes i was more than disappointed by this movie that i look forward! for two reasons, because i love lelouch and jeremy irons is one of my favorite actors! the first 20 minutes are pleasant and nothing happens it does absolutely nothing in this movie or at least nothing like me interrested! the whole interspersed with songs sung by kass p. i find unbearable! finally, voila, a movie that i could do without! when will the next lelouch as "the beautiful story or" les miserables "...???
