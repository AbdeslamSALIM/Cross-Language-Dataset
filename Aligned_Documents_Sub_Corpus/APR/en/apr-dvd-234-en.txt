there are films like that otherwise they could imagine, and not necessarily both. clint eastwood is still the cowboys, running for the umpteenth time his famous number of fastest man in the west. beside him a indian sorcerer, a barker black, a professional lasso ... and a rich heiress who fled her psychopathic husband. for if the gun shots there, they are held under a tent, and have for that purpose to distract the child with a costume inspired by that of buffalo bill. clint eastwood signed by a tender and funny film, and pays a respectful tribute to frank capra films, while portraying an america where humanistic assistance and friendship (very strong) are the only honorable virtues (even a deserter from the vietnam has the right to a second chance in this america). clint eastwood is perfect in his role as cowboy operetta who lives only to please the children, and ends up falling in love with the beautiful héirtière (beautiful sondra locke). a cult scene is particularly moving and magnifying the film: ruined, the troupe of acrobats bronco billy decides to attack a train (on horseback and in costume ...) a century after the cowboys and indians ... it's a treat ...
