in my opinion, that an animated film that takes a little off the beaten track as usual there is one superhero, but here waouah! now that a whole family of credentials. excuse the little's father has incredible strength, the mother an elastic body, the son running as fast as superman, the girl becomes invisible and the icing on the cake the baby has powers even more mind-blowing. pixar brought together in this film a synthesis of different superhero powers as incredible and extraordinary. the story is good, and me what interested me is that a family is "making the honor. this does remind you not he something?. but if see: another family with equally famous black humor and more, you have recognized: the adams family of course (as crazy as each other !!!). in any case "the incredibles" is a film very interesting because there is work on the animation which is quite exceptional and you never get bored one second. the bonus dvd are super. so feel free and you also admire the work of pixar studios, they did not astonish us!
