to say that second helping is a rock album is a commonplace insult to the genius of this groupe.exercice: listen to the replay and then clapton, jj cale, jefferson, canned heat (even with john lee hooker), neil young, and i forget. you understand why i talk about sources of rock. everything is there. this is probably the only case where two guitars do not mix brushes, yes, i exaggerate just a little, mike taylor and keith richards are in fact very get yer yaya's out, but hey ... second helping is - over many productions pop rock of the time and it's already great.
