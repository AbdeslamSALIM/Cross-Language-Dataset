the story is nice ... but too much vocabulary for a very correct style. if it's simple and dry, everything should be. here, there is a discrepancy between amelie pretentious, copying a style popular in american and wants very personal, and amelia construstion. always the same concern: performance. better to write a book every 2 years or 2 pounds a year? and then, always the same purpose! so, an interesting but not enough work, a troubling issue but sanitized.
