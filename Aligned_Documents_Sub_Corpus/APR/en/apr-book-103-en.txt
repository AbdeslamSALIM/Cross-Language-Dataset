disappointed by this book. while the schedules are required for those who do not know many good rules php, or even just to get a little booster shot, but a book of 446 pages, if we remove these schedules and the general blabla the beginning of a book, it is about 270 pages for the present framework. and when you know how to have presented the books of "cahiers du programmer," it does not leave much room for detail ... moreover, it seems from reading other reviews that readers have appreciated the annexes and remain on their hunger for content. finally a simple presentation, without much education, it goes a bit of a cock in the ass between the chapters and we feel obliged to quickly find information on the internet to advance without too much difficulty, see the book away for the benefit of more detailed explanations ... only two stars, then, because the schedules are quality and that's all. perhaps this book will help the developer who already knows zf and he will find some basic, but personally i would not recommend the beginner zf (even if he has knowledge in another framework!)
