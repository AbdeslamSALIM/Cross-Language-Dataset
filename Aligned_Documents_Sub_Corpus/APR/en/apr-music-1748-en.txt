the group seemed well, the four singles that i listened really liked me so i took the initiative to buy this album and after? i was disappointed the band metro station will be the dud and playing good rock with guitars so that the passage for what they do are useless: the quartet (and one might even say the trio as drummer is nothing batteries pieces are all made synthesizer) play only the dance means no guitar, just singing (sometimes even singing in rap) and synthesizers: the dance, basically, what the fans pop rock do not buy this disc because they are at high risk of being disappointed like me! if you are looking for pop rock rather buy cds or jonas brothers all american rejects or even killerpilze (if you like a little punk) their album has them so well that we believe are best of but not all songs are good but they are not best of!
