i loved the previous novel julie wolkenstein, colloque sentimental, some willingly approached by david lodge, but then, i confess that i will not go through. happy ending or not, i do not know! check the middle of the book, i still find it confusing, intricate, well written, but certainly too many characters and periods that tangle and a plot that disappears or is diluted in a description of characters too long. but the beginning was very promising damage. there are so many books to discover that i do not give way more to go until the end when i really does not catch.
