be sensitive to the slowness of the debonair english inspector somewhere fairly similar to its german counterpart derrick, to enjoy this series ... it's my case! nothing fantastic, no outrageous violence, train daily routine of an inspector lambda, endearing, widowed and lonely. the surveys are not searched too but english, the atmosphere is, and i love! rest and not making head. a watch on a rainy day before tea and biscuits.
