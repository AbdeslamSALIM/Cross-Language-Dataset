here's the kind of movie is the feeling of having seen a thousand times ... this is not a bad film, but the scenario is so commonplace and predictable that we can follow him so distracted without losing the thread. the cast is decent, but kim bassinger is particularly convincing in his role. in short, we correct film, nothing more.
