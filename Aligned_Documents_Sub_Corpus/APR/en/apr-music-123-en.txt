who are you? ultimate who album? it is thought that the fans in 1978. it was not so much the better for us! finally, as a career on a disappointing album, was harmful.. of the 1st song was a bad impression. the sound is not great, many synths, too. but miracle! the album ends with the title that gave its name to the entire disk "who are you." the piece is rich, there are arrangements for accurate, beautiful flights piano and finally guitar rapeuse. the disc is saved in extremis by piece. but the whole is very poor. a drive only for collectors.
