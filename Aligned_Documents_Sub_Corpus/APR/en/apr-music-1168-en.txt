this cd released in 1989, is much more powerful than its successors. the riffs are too simple, but the sound produced by the trio (here without dave grohl, the drummer) is simply exceptional. we retain exceptional pieces like love buzz, floyd the barber, negative creep and the little known but exceptionally mr.moustache
