i think this is the movie about the war best shot at present. i'm not saying this is the best, same for the benefit or special effects, just the images that we offer are real paintings. we are at guadalcanal and the record is beautiful. the parade scenes cleverly, we attend to a massacre in the garden of eden. the thought of the soldier, very important, as it whispers sometimes makes us go through all sorts of emotions. a vision of military strategy in general, based on the promotion, which is a damn about the fate of men. humanly rich. thin red line is a masterpiece!
