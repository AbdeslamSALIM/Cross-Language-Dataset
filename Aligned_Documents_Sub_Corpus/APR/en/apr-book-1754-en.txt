martha grimes is a specialist in crime fiction. his favorite characters, plant and jury, are found elsewhere in a series that has nearly two dozen books. this means that if american writer likes the genre. in my case, "the unknown of the cove" does not give me the desire to explore his other opus. indeed, this novel contains too many improbabilities and cliches to really let himself go with the suspense it tries to create, including multiplying the suspects and false leads. is this translation is bad, but his style is often laborious. on several occasions, history s'Ã©gard in incidents that do nothing to the story, especially when it comes to convincing a woman who knows nothing (maybe she is already appeared in another book in this series) not to marry. the motive behind the murder is actually rather unconvincing, and the psychology of some people very inconsistent (how can you desire the death of innocent children to avenge the death by illness of a family member? or turn into porn and be the wife of a millionaire?) grimes abusing sentimental mushy: the characters are often very beautiful, very rich, have experienced great sorrow etc.. and the height of inconsistency: the girl "unbelievably beautiful" who physically killed two innocent children will not be sought by the great and relentless detective macalvie, however, that "never give up, because in any case "two of his three accomplices already dead."
