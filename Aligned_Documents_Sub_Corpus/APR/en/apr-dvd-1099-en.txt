sin city is a marvel. but this collector's edition is more like a more editions, a scam. all of adord it is impossible to remove the subtitles in french. we are forced to watch a movie in the original version with french subtitles and it is unbearable. this is not a problem for those who looks french, must still come to support the french dubbing.
