set of 5 stars galore for this album is totally ridiculous! a great fm sound good dripping, choruses, albeit sometimes catchy, but far too stereotyped ( "elysian fields", "i thought i knew it all", "blood of heroes "... it is not far from here foreigner!), it sounds way too" commercial "... perhaps a little heavier than cte agree, but it is sorely lacking in cutting edge riffs and the vocals of dave mustaine, who with this album, was probably about the eurovision song contest! anyway ... so just go in that direction, i still prefer "risk", which, despite its shortcomings, at least has the merit of not playing the hypocrisy card! the "perfect balance between aggression and melody" fortunately found a worthy representative with "cripting writings", album far better produced, written, aggressive and inspired!
