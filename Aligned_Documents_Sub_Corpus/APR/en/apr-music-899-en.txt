unconditional george benson, i was surprised by this new album ... nothing to do with what i have listened to so far. it would have made me listen to this album by failing to tell me it was him, i would not have guessed ... i do not see where he wanted to come ... surely go for a different audience. disappointed. from the commercial variety, without any size, scale musical ... too bad. for my part, very bad george benson. to avoid so for those seeking the virtuosity of george benson.
