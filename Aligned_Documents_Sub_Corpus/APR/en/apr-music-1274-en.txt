after reading good reviews about this album, i expected much better. simplistic rhythms, melodies unoriginal and bland, singing "the german" in the bad sense ... in short the only interesting takeover spring vivaldi saves this album from complete anonymity. there are much better for metal, whatever your preferred style.
