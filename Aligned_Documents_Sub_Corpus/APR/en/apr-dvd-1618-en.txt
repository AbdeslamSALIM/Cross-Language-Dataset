how horrible! i do not even tell me what was my dismay and disgust when i launched "death and rebirth" on my dvd player ... i am a very big fan of the tv show including the french version is very good (although it was criticized) and when i appercu no person had the same voice and the dubbing was horrible i got knocked on the original version subtitled french ... result, even the french subtitling is not up to my expectations ... not everything is under assayed (capital but some screens) ... i find it outrageous for all fans to have massacred the film tan awaited by thousands of people ... the sites and magazines specialized in manga are disgusted by such work ... everyone wanted a vf but not working with our heroes baccl√© denatured by voices that they are absolutely not ... there are even errors in the main characters (it shame!) however, this dvd are good investissemnt as movies themselves are great and will delight all fans in subtitled original version. anyway for the france we have for the moment that this version is ... pending a re-doubled, if you're a fan of the series, the pick you (it's better than nothing). if you're not a fan, or you do not know the series, go your way because you'll be very disappointed ...
