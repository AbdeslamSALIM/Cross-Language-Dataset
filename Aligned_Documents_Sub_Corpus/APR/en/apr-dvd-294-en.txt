yes, i am left to try. i yielded to temptation in the box blu-ray crystal die and 58 minutes to live. pi√®ge de cristal is a horror on blu-ray. for 58 minutes to live image is a little less bad, but is however, very grainy and receives no management contrasts that gives a muddled and dark. the most surprising is that almost all the film is bathed in light "pink" or "purple" and faces and scenery are very rarely dyed "natural." as for die hard this edition blu-ray is lower than the first edition dvd that was already not very good. to avoid waiting in an edition of the movie in a blu-ray worthy of the name.
