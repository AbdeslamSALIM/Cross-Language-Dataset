can not read this book for the average mortal ..... perhaps with an ma in literature .....? bad .... there are some good thoughts on the ruthlessness and indifference of the earth (gaia) to hold us accountable sooner or later ..... i would not recommend it, except the amateur style ornate and convoluted as possible!
