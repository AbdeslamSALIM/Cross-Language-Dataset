this book is for sale and to run the business objects supposed to change your life in two recipes. who can believe that? if it were that simple everyone would. the magic is a spiritual journey, not a goal but a means to connect with the divinity whatsoever (it's based on your beliefs). do not give money to this man who clearly does not know anything unless he knows enough to want to keep you in error. i am a bookseller esoteric and i know what i say; o)!
