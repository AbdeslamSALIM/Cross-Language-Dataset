exp√©rimentaliste.le surprising album and its grain is very similar music psyke-svente (ca quintet, jefferson airplane, hendrix ...) while remaining hip hop part of a flow rytmyks and very old school.cette scale production of quality (only complaint: a slight lack of infra-bass on some mix, but it also strengthens the hand "of his time") is a true hybrid between psyke-seventies and early old school rap 90.je not know if lp is his first but nws has a sacred style and originality rare.je think that even if his intention is perfectible and ideas are excellent and this is essential.
