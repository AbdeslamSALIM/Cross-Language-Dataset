what a funny title: "release yourself at the polls" ... i remember a time when bernie sang: "i am a newsletter that intoxicates and we slip into a ballot box" (la grande illusion) ... times change and indeed the spite is gone ... as for "the excuse of age"; existed before motörhead motörhead trust and is still if not more brutal than ever, with their last album ... so, excuse me, but "the excuse of age ",... i smile ... so, an album / compilation well for those who do not know their first titles, (although it already existed) ... for the rest, sad fact, i put only 1 star ...
