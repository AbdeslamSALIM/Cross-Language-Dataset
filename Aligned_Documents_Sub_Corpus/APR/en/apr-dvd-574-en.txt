the enthusiasm for this little series b mocharde seems incomprehensible. taking the principle archiclassique travel time, "the butterfly effect" accumulates scenes glaucous to disgust (dog burnt alive, pedophile neighbor filming his kids, and convict nazi rapists, etc..) and laugh unintentionally by stupidity some surprises. but judging from the bonus dvd, it seems that we have escaped the worst! overwhelming.
