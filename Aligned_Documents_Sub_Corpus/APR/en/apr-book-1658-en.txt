i expected a lot from reading such a book given the reputation of the author in some press photography. i was very disappointed. : what mathematical theories that! i liked much more didactic explanation, so that the reader curious as i am able to take advantage. although scientific training (phd) and has a long amateur photography experience, confess not to have understood most theoretical developments, supposed to help the understanding of practical applications. this book is perhaps an elite intellectual or passionate bibliophiles.
