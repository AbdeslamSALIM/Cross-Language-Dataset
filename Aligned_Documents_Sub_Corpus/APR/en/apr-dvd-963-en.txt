the world of david lynch is a world incomprehensible and the limit of esotericism. i must confess that i could go after dvd.il this is definitely not a science fiction movie classic as wars starsthese subject is too inconsistent and there might be no analysis or reflections personnelles.les characters, setting the scene sets and costumes are a blend of ancient and baroque worthy of a surrealist painting the salvador dali. the technical quality of the dvd is not an issue because the image and sound are excellent. personally i think the best bluray to stay current in the field of pure science fiction and the future of humanity in the vastness of the universe remains "2001 space odyssey" 'a classic despite its age and most technically it is probably one of the best bluray current (with "the conquest of the west "i would put first) because the image is at the limit of perfection.
