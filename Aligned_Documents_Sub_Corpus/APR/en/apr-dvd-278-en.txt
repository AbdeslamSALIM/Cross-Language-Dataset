whenever i came across this movie, it was such a slice of fun that i immediately forgot all my worries - it is his only interest. ultracommercial cast and unnecessary special effects worthy of ugly a series b, dialogues unbearable heaviness, philosophical and mystical folk-science geek with even eight years would be ashamed, and obviously the final little homily ( "human materialize what was darker ...") in which he completes this magnificent interstellar nanar. levinson has managed to make it stronger than "contact" to his buddy zemeckis - which is already a performance - while playing the kubrick sub-prefecture (sphere cons the monolith!) and pumping (unwittingly?) the atmosphere of abyss. it looks like a bad parody of tarkovsky's solaris, it looks like a schoolboy joke that went wrong and who would become like a bible of the heavy and tasteless. in short, in one word: cuculte!
