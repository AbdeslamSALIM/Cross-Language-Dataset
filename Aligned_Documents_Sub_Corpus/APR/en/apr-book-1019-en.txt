rarely has a book surprised me as much. its history, its surprises, its plot, this puzzle to both historical and comtemporary which will link the past and this dramatically. narration and the quality of writing (big applause for translators) make us live again in barcelona in search of a past and future, on funds from the horrors of civil war. after reading this book, i had a hard time finding a play with such class. to consume without moderation, is pleased to arrival.
