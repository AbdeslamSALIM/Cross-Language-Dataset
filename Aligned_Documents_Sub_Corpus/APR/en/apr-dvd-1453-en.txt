nothing to add on the bottom. the previous comments are sufficient. but there is the soundtrack to french ... and then, what a disappointment! it is stated on the back of the jacket, that "some scenes missing (?!) of the french version are vo with french subtitles. but these cuts are completely erratic (and no subtitles!), numerous, and, ultimately, immensely irritating. moreover, the french voice of james stewart is not one to which we are accustomed and which was, however, that vhs cassette. i am very disappointed and will surely separate me from this dvd in favor of engraving on blank cd in my good old vhs!
