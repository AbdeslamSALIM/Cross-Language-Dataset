we often tend to do much when he is a newcomer, tenor or diva. in this case, jk is rather handsome, and indeed a perfect technique. but all is not perfect. his italian accent, he is supposed to be flawless, pales in comparison to his acolytes. the german stamp is clearly visible, and "che gelida manina" is not nearly as captivating as it should. similarly, the alfredo is a bit pale compared to the energy of a villazon or pavarotti. true, his repertoire is wide, yes, there is rechnique. yes, he has the physique of a winner. and after? it comes to praise when other singers are delivering interpretations of verdi's much more ambitious and beautiful. it is with joseph calleja, whose color and tone of voice is beautiful (her interpretation of "la mia letizia infondere vorrei" proves this). but that's it. the great villazon, one of which we talked incessantly until then falters somewhat, and we hastened to replace it pronto. this disc is good, but far from perfect.
