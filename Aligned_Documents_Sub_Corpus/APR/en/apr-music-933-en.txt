i can not say i was a hardcore fan - i have some album - but i still bought it. my first impression is that it surprised me though. unlike those earlier albums, lenny kravitz delivers a much more eclectic album, with beautiful sounds. there are songs in the tradition of pure rock but there are also some ballads that allow well balanced album. the song i like from underneath the other is "what did i do with my life?"
