it was long-awaited acoustic album and we are not disappointed. indeed, what happiness! nice varied selection that illuminates the multiple talents and versatility of rory. and how we miss him! if you have a dvd player, it must absolutely get irish tour 74! rory at his peak, splendid! exactly as i remember him in concert. the video from 1989 in cork is also good but how to say "painful" to watch because i can not help but feel nervous, impatient and a little sad. however, it appears happy to see (as was the case every year, its audience in the city. but of course, performance is fantastic, as always.
