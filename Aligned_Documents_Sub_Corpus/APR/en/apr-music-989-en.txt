well, yes! disappointing. and yet i was previously a huge fan. i can not help but draw a parallel with radiohead that i also found it recently after the release of "in rainbows" (yes, it is possible). i find no surprise in this album: melodies that sink in the facility, vessel hyper rhythms, sounds rather flat. we are truly in the pure business without taking risks in order to hang those who would miss scientist disorders or previous albums. for those who do not know, listen to "ok computer" and you will understand my words. already x &amp; y could be frightened by what happens today. pity.
