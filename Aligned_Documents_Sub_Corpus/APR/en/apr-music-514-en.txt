group has never been as hard as overstated and reassessed. the velvet underground was nothing but a bunch of trendy musicos thinking it was easy to get our bladders for lanterns offering sounds inaudible electric violins for over 10 minutes and making us believe that be smart ... worse, there is even talk of a work of art in some circles and reading the interviews with john cale realizes it still today, these types of themselves as creators of 'avant-garde ... honestly, is there really people who enjoy listening to this disc and find this stuff (check choice) subversive urban shocking, evil etc ... of course, tastes and colors ... obviously i put 0 stars, but there must be at least 1 star then too bad! the velvet is not good (especially this disc anyway) but the worst is that the aura and reputation of the group is such that it wants us to believe that this is music contemporary american.
