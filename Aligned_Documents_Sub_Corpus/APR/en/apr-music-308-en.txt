after listening to previews and reading reviews, i let myself be seduced, and i ordered this cd. first exhilarating listening, you let yourself go, we read the words, it explodes. the next day, i listen and disillusioned, one word comes pr describe this album (i know that this album of patrice) is : lasse! so it goes without saying that all securities are licked, instrumental level, it's good ... but the pattern chorus / verse vrmt is heavy, and anyway it's missing the thing ... the fact that we love an album, you listen without getting bored. lovers reggae, go your way, outside of the voice, instrumental level, and nothing to do in words either. enthusiasts all horizons, beware ...
