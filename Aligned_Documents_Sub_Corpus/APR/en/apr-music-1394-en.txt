no comments for this best of? yet it is excellent. each title is different from another. it is free. a replay of the devilish sad but true metallica, track 6 is also excellent, and the text is to take the second degree course. thank you kid rock, and finally a musician who is not head and making fun of musical barriers, and it works.
