.. maybe, but the sources of what? metallica? this sumptuously missed. after a media uproar we boasted that metallica is back, listening to the album, "death magnetic" is still more than a detour back to any era (black album and before ), as were the load and reload. this is not metallica, there is no "melody" and james hetfield sings no more - it's always the same gueuleries typical metal present and therefore impossible to retain a title rather than another. certainly there is an effort to create music (and especially production compared to st anger) that we can possibly remind us of the good old days, with guitar solos, solos that kirk hammett is cheesy (see the documentary some kind of monster) . morals? metallica is still in a state of convalescence post st-anger/some kind of monster. clearly, they are really old and became the image of the album cover, i wonder if metallica has simply not delivered the last nail in their coffin. i fear that metallica is dead. it's finished. as ac / dc. rest of the old albums, absolute masterpieces that i listen to constantly.
