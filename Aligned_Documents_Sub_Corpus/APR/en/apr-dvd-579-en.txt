is it bottoming out? can we go lower in the inept, the fade, the bland, meaningless, the void? reithermann signs here his worst bottom-out. of course, we say that the film reflects the spirit of his time. the animation to the father gave way to something more square, more mechanical, more economical (yes), a japanese (almost). is it that damn tv system in the air? because this film has just the standard tv (youth). scenario appalling, no magic (it was the image of disney yet), the gag of course, but phoned. forget the fast and flanquons re-editions in the tray!
