the choice, necessarily arbitrary, extracts is disappointing ... it would have been better to release a real full, with all emissions, the purists (including myself) would have appreciated, even if it would have been costly. instead, there was a sprinkling not very representative. we would also like to have as a bonus song in the whole "this guy is too much, this guy is too" performed by coco girls ... well ... not! i confirmed, and signed: extremely disappointing!
