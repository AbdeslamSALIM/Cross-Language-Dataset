must absolutely avoid this issue. indeed on this cd, the sound has been digitally remastered (in reality denatured) to get closer to the sounds of eliminator. the result is catastrophic because it transformed a boogie-rock album for clear, clean and precise sound insipid porridge. buy the remastered version of the album released in 2006 by rhino records (ref: b000ccd0hq): it has the original and there is only happiness!
