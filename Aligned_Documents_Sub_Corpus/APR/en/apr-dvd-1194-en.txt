here is a little small man, tom cruise, which takes on a martial driver of u.s. naval aviation, which is more elite, courageous. what good looks of love he wants to see! big plans! eyes that speak for themselves. eyes faded reflections of a soul dirty. the film is zero. a turnip agreed that it is so tasteless. the little salt that we find is that of music, which, in the late 1980s, passing in the night clubs (as all teens are thinking "top gun", no doubt?). idiot. as the active scientologist tom cruise, i savagely fighting - of course. i will not see the latest movie poster for "operation valkyrie", operetta in placing more passive cruise sectarian propaganda.
