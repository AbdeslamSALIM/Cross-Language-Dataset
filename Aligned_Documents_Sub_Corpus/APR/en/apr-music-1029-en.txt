sorry, but i would not call this album the album of the year! (need to see the great symbol of the metal of slayer but hey ..) the riffs in this album are copy-paste of morbid angel, cannibal corpse and nile and other drummer does more than just blast beats trying to imitate very good drummers. in short, it is noted even when a good sound and good ideas on qques qques songs (people = shit, the shape, skin heretic anthem or ticket), but no more because these gentlemen slipknot does not shine by their originality! in short, much ado about nothing.
