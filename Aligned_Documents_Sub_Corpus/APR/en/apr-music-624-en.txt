and rebelote! it is once again the great angelo badalamenti, composer of quasi-incumbent david lynch, that it sticks! this soundtrack is one of the best i've had time to listen. the themes, always in perfect harmony with the flashes of visual lynch, are varied and always so dark (cf.les previous compositions for lynch badalamenti) and one finds oneself has the hum as they are heady. a stream of urgency: the second track, simply entitled "mulholland drive", which sums up his own mind this movie yet so difficult to understand but which provides an extremely rare pleasure. other songs listen very well and everyone reseve its share of surprises (especially the silence and other sounds, so dear to daivd lynch). we are especially surprised and impressed by the tremendous variety of sounds that make up this mysterious bo but even more remarkable is the mastery of angelo badalamenti and surprising even if it is his first attempt, it is to recognize that the person has creativity to spare. do not go especially next to the object of pure fantasy composer who will give you emotions to the extent of the film. mysterious, dreamlike, stirring, symphonic, subtle, original, cleverly orchestrated, sublimely long, a real journey into the night and dreams / nightmares ... listen to while falling asleep ...
