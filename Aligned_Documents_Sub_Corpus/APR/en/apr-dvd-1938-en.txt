a very good film! choreographed by a master film-hong hong, the fights are superb and very innovative in our western cinema. the story is also very good, very inventive, fr√©ant an entire universe around it. may have even interpreted as a summary of the philosophical thought of some classics .... but it's going very far! without going that far, you can see history as an interesting reflection on our world and its functioning. the music is excellent, and it illustrates perfectly the film support. the acting is perfect and the element of surprise plays a bottom. the best by far, of the trilogy.
