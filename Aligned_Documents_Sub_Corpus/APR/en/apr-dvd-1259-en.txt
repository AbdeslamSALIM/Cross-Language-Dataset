ow, ow! take a work ma-gis-tral series which consists of 7 volumes, choose the first two, read it through, summarize it in order to make a movie of 2 hours, add a pinch of special effects and tadaaaa! is the work: a massacre! i admit i do not understand why this film is generating so much admiration ... of course, you need a lot of courage to try to adapt to film these novels by frank herbert, and i salute the courage, but otherwise .. .. i just think these great works are not adaptable to film, unless you have the will to make the starwars trilogies .... just imagine, in the 3 episodes (4.5 and 6) combined into one ... the result would it not changed? the characters developed by herbert, the universe it describes the intrigues that develop are so rich that we can make soup too bland! i am inclined to think that those who made this movie did not understand, or like they have simplified what was not simplifiable well .... it gives anything! to avoid, however, get the books ... then you will understand my comment.
