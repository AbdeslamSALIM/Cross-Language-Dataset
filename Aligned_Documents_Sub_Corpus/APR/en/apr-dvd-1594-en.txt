i'm almost relieved to see that i was not the only one to be disappointed by this movie. i do not want to spoil the pleasure of those who 'knew' but rather appreciate to warn those who might be disappointed given the critical acclaim surrounding this film ... personally, i found nothing attractive in the game scenario or actresses, i would say even worse (at the risk of shock) that i am bored and waiting impatiently for the end ... something i can be escaped (?)
