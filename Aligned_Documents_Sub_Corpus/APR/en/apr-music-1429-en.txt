i just heard the album, and i return it even not so strong ... the guy has a terrible flow (as usual what, for those who know), the prods are excellent, it's really the little classic i hoped for him. among the pieces of bravery, i would cite "twenty one questions" (with a little guitar to make you mad), "what's up gangsta" (nothing but the chorus is already embedded in my head), "many man" (the kind of sound that puts goose bumps with a text height), "heat" (chip good fit in), "if i can not" (i almost fart to the neck strength to move his head on the there) ... well, i stop here or i'll spend the entire album review, but put already a little side note. you can not say i would not warn you!
