i accidentally stumbled upon when a friend elizabeth george m 'loaned' memory infidel ". since then, i bought some of these novels and i must say that i appreciate her style: clear, simple and direct. "inquiry into the fog" is the last that i read and i've really enjoyed d ' have more details on the duo lynley-havers who is the red thread of the novels of elizabeth george. despite a complex history, it takes a lot of fun to unravel the tangle woven by the author (no more details here spoils all the fun).
