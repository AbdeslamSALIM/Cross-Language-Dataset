well, that's not really the joy. i saw the movie, and i was afraid of falling on a turnip ... this was the case. not only the players who know the universe "lovecraft" doom does not find it (apart from references to key points, such as uac, or the bfg), but otherwise everything else is irrelevant. note also that some characters are allusions to the creators of doom: dr. carmack (for john carmack, one of the coders of id software), a willits (tim willits has been a level designer video game) . without wanting to "deprive" the content, there are only few "monsters" of the game: some knight of hell, demons, simple, and the "" dog "" cybernetic doom 3. the sequence for subjective gives more inclined to laugh it's scary. in addition, having abandoned the side "of the monster from hell" that makes "" "" charming "" "" bestiary of doom to explain the genesis of the invaders show little interest that should the film. a huge disappointment, but he must face the obvious: all video games brought in the form of films are flops.
