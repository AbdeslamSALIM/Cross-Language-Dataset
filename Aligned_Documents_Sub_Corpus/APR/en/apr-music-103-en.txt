what a disappointment! this album is totally missed, we must understand by this that it is no longer the "madonna" as before "it's simple, 2 tracks are drinking on this album:" miles away "and" dance 2night " the rest is r'n'b without rhythm, without genius, in short, that has nothing to do with his best album "ray of light" "how did she dare to lay this? no respect for his fans!
