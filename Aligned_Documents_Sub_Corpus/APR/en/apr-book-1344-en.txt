in fact i can not explain why, but i did not like this book. it is really empty, the characters are stereotypes, writing easier. i could not figure out what anna g. had meant to convey? i found it bland and ss no interest. ts ds case, i understand the end ;-) a book avoid, ds the extent that it does describe life but there envel flavor, by not describing only superficially. (a jai bah if finally managed to explain pq i did not love!). in the same genre (well + or -) elementary particle is superior i think.
