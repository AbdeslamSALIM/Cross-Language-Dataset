coldplay in principle j'a-dore! album "parachutes" i can hear the loop so when i heard the single "viva la vida" (very catchy, driving etc.) ... i have not hesitated to buy the album. ultimately, i only like two songs in this album so if my advice to you is all good listening and possibly buy the singles.
