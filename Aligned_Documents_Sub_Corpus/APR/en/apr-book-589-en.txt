i urge you this book. once you read you'd like everyone to read, family, friends, doctors, dentists ... this book is remarkable because it addresses a wide audience and especially it is very well documented with numerous references. i myself am m ^ me suffers from environmental illness (multiple chemical sensitivity or mcs) and i finally found this book by a hope of healing. i am quite acknowledged in testimony and i wish that many people with emerging diseases such as me-m ^ me read to regain hope and see that healing is finally possible. this book is also aimed at "healthy" because it is a goldmine for staying healthy. anna
