i expected a lot from this group that portrays me as a clone of nightwish. the problem is that it's sub-nightwish! production mediocre singer with no feeling, no catchy melodies, one gets the impression that this is amateur work! the competitors is tough in the field of gothic and this album is not that there will be a box, sorry for them, but it is far from over! it will require that the group reviewed a copy!
