this is the first time i found an album of depeche mode is missed ... lack of innovation, no melodies at all catchy, soaring boredom while listening to the cd, even after the tenth time ... the album opens with "in chains" soft knee "a hole to feed" far from memorable, "wrong" the single unstoppable (phew!), melodic and tormented (like video), but much too short (why not making a longer album version as it had been the case for "it's no good "on ultra?), a" fragile voltage chouille one more interesting than the beginning of the cd but not ultra-catchy, or mystical, or modern, "little soul" and "in sympathy" reminiscent of the tracks dullest of exciter, "peace" which is quite well written for the instrumental part but fishing seriously in terms of votes (anthem sweet and a little silly), a "come back" which recalls a bit the first solo album dave gahan ( "paper monsters"), a "perfect" which starts well, moves well (it's cut for a single, that) but with a melody frankly too easy for the depeche mode (martin, you make us what is ?), "miles away" clearly out of the lot with a super efficient manipulation but a vocal not very catchy, "jezebel" would be the middle part of the slow tracks of ultra without success, and finally "corrupt" is a good song but unfortunately is pumped to the chorus of the song "jezebel" recoil (alan wilder, released in 2000, a chance that we find the same title on both albums ????). short, horribly album disappointing compared to the darkness and complexity songs of faith and devotion, the melodic perfection of some great reward, the mysticism of an ultra or violator and ingenuity of an angel or playing the music for the masses. ... too bad
