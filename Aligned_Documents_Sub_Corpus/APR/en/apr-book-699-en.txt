in honesty i read all three volumes, but frankly it was not easy. the story is convoluted, cumbersome. certainly we learn a lot about china, but will unravel the truth of the invented. yet all this happening, but history is peppered every two pages of pictorial descriptions of lovemaking of many heroes, and there, without being prudish, it quickly becomes soul (and not at all exciting, no, no). still, i wanted to make a clean breast and go until the end whether the herdsman and the weaver were faring. well i thought it lacked a volume, so it ends in fishtail (the case to say given the title of the second volume, and many descriptions of the heroes of this appendix).
