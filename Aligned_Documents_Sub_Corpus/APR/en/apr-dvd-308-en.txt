any person who remains a crumb of crack ability to marvel at this wonderful movie. the graphics are superb, the wonderful scenario ... not much to say. by cons, if the film crew has done something impressive, can not be said of the dvd publisher. the collector's version has no interest in packaging, rather better than the standard edition. to the left is empty abstract ... nothingness.
