surely this is the great success of 2009 this very much anticipated friday the 13th, beautiful image, masterfully recreated setting, all players are good, but particularly dereck mears, aka jason is really very good in every sense of the word! certainly i was a little leery of some critics say, but frankly pounce on this dvd, there is nothing wrong! thank you jason ...
