everybody says, the critical first official rank, he is a gay vaudeville fictionalized. that's right, with all that that drains cliches, platitudes and excess. this book is written in a simple pen. do not mean it's bad writing: the author bypasses any effect of style and works mainly in its history. yet the characters do not suffer, they are even extremely attanchants. so we follow their adventures grotesque, burlesque the possible, unlikely to desire. good evening entertainment but not a future literary prize.
