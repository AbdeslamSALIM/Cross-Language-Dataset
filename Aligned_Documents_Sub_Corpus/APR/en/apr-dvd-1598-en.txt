knowing this show to be seen in its 72 movie, i waited impatiently for its release on dvd. alas, what a disappointment! very bad image quality (it seems the "super 8") but mostly it is not the movie version of 72 which she presented an excellent image quality and framing. the dvd version is poorly filmed and consequently the great bob fosse's really not spoiled. the sound is worse than the cd version which offers a good stereo image. and all this mediocrity for about 30e.!
