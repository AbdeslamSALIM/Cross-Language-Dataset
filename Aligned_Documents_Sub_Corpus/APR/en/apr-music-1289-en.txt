i was delighted when i learned that nolwenn out his second album. this young woman showed us during 4 months full extent of his talent and potential of his beautiful voice. unfortunately, this second album is a big disappointment: we hardly hear ... an accompanying loud and inappropriate, a digitized voice and so on. nolwenn is nevertheless endowed with a very fine instrument, so why not use it and delight us with songs that metteraient this beautiful voice in value? furthermore, all of the songs are boring and bland, unfortunately. i sincerely hope that the third album is better quality, but since this second album pleases the audience (consisting largely of pre-adolescent (e) s), i'm afraid this is nolwenn cr√©nau singers whispering that leave a thin voice and offers the public and commercial pieces that will likely be empty forgotten within a year or two ... what a waste.
