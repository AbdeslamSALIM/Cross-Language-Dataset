both the number 1 had some good qualities, but this "behind enemy lines 2" is characterized by a pauper scenario, large improbabilities strategic and tactical staging weak and unconvincing actors well. not worth a b series television. too bad there were better things to do on a north korean event. do not waste your time, go your way and you flip on lopus 1.
