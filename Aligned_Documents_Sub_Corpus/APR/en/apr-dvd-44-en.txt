on the yanks in riquerie, but not elsewhere. once again i went to see this movie with a "good mood", i know a little of india (the atmosphere and colors allured me on the trailer), i wanted to laugh ... and it rate bin again, and after reading rave reviews of a bunch of newspapers that "love" that i said my old'd have done better you re "salaam bombay", or "la nuit bengali". if there is some saw a "train-movie" friendly, i only saw the display of all that americans know how to "waffle" royally when they go out of their noses texas. background: the indians do not make love with a stranger in the toilet (even first class) train over-crowded (this is really not a indian custom). i think the genius (who must be two turnips)'s never set foot in a second-class sleeper or even a first: no vendor "chai", no vendor cakes, ice or super frosted "even in the stations! no beggar, no man half-naked living on alms and you meet every 100 meters!, and then i have not seen nor many sacred cows that clog roads and railways. too clean! that's for the form. but it gets worse: the export of the sacrosanct american family (which exists only in their dreams: "american beauty") cream, "the elder brother, who manages all the other" idiot ", toxicological, disrespectful of the customs of other (we used), their gait initiation in india .......... why not zimbabou√©! it does not take the road again this is never funny, here becomes even pretentious at times (sequence with children). on the technical side: do not try the script: there is not (can not do a "thelma and louise" all year!) completely pathetic, and worse enough.
