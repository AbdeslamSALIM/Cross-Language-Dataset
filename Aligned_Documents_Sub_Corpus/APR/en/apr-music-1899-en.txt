there long as i bought this album but i took the opportunity to make comment. daddy yankee had been waiting for all these fans for a "great album with lots of stars, but in fact all it is very disappointing. besides "ella me levanto, daddy yankee totally removed the style of reggaeton which characterized him in barrio fino, and is closer in style rap / hip hop artist, who has disappointed all those fans latinos. moreover, in most of these songs, you could say it tries to copy the singing style of some singers like don omar and arcangel. it was a big waiting for a big disappointment. at least his new album, talento de barrio shows he has taken at least a little aware of this.
