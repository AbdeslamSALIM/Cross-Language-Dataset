yes, let's be honest with ourselves! is perhaps the worst solo album by paul mccartney. it's total chaos, no production of crude stripping! what comes to my mind, i operate, i put canned and move along nothing to see ..... musically it is the abyss ..... but beyond this, the album also reflects something else. first it should be totally unconscious and then "suicidal" to go out, what we could call a draft album. (other than paul is not the first time! remind us "wild life! ). wings came to derail and paul really needs to step back, it is fun, but it would have been better not to leave the result. the other interesting aspect is that always in all disks of paul mccartney, there are titles that deserve more attention. this is the case here with waterfalls, beautiful ballad simplicity, with on the way (which would have deserved a more thorough but hangs) with one of these days (another ultra simple ballad), and of course with coming up, which became the hit of the album and that it must be said, is excellent. as always with paul, two sides cotoient a crude and often brilliant and an easier, more attractive, darker, which pulls down. a failed album, whose sole interest, we prove that paul mccartney is a man made of flesh and blood, and that in every man there is a good and a bad side .... ps: the new paul mccartney album will be released around june 2007 and according to rumors he might be entitled mccartney iii .... to follow .....
