i bought this dvd on the enthusiastic comments of users. my children are 7 and 9 years. they are more afraid than ever before watching a movie. to see chihiro's parents turn into pigs, abominable, to be alone ... they were unbearable. other events through which the girl is also terrifying. i do not recommend this movie for small children. there is no age limit on this movie. scandalous! yes, the pictures are beautiful and yes, he exudes a certain magic and poetry of all. and yes, the movie ends well. but i do not see the point of imposing such a long journey with the characters and tension horriblissimes hardly bearable for children.
