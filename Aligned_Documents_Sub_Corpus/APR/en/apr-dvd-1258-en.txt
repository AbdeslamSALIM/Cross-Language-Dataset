fantastic wonderful dvd with many extras. beautiful, sharp, wide screen transfer goal unfortunately, there is no audio track français-only french and italian - also there are no subtitles français. still, it's a great movie and a great dvd. i just wish i knew what they were talking about, but these films are so 'visual' that it doesn't really matter. put in your own dialogue.
