suppose the diagnosis is good: we live in a finite world and whatever happens we will exhaust fossil resources. furthermore, the author does not demonize nuclear power which is welcome. recall that the car oil and indirectly causing 1 million deaths per year, the nuclear risk is low glance. as against a strong assumption: climate change is a major threat. worse yet the proposed solution: tax progessive (8 % / year) and irreversible painless for the consumer. at first i admit, after 10 years i think is untenable. moreover, the author proposes to start a national solution (assuming the 99% remaining will follow!). minor forgotten jmc to pay taxes must have the means, yet i believe that such a rate would result in a shock tax exodus and overall loss.
