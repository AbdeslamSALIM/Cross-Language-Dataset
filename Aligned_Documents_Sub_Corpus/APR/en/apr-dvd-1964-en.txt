a beautiful film, moving interviews, deleted scenes, commentaries exclusive ... a truly great dvd! notice that i wrote after his first broadcast on our screens. a distribution dream for a film moving. once again, corinne excels in the art of playing with children. her duet with the very young baptist perre is simply magical ... a moment of eternity! a difficult role as a small boy of 4 years and half who learns that his mother is alive but it was "all broken" and could not take care of him until present. a beautiful scenario and so just on the scary theme of amnesia that can happen to all of us thus challenging the viewer and certainly calls into question his relationship to others and to the preciousness of life. note also the energy staggering of the best friend played by nathalie corre or listening to and understanding of psy pierre deny (captain kremen in a woman of honor ...).
