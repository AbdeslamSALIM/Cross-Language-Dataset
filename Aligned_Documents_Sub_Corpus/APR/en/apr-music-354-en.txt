it was presented diana krall as a new jazz diva, like ella fitzgerald or the back ... i think that last one or two songs where one is caught in the game, well his performance lacks luster, and above she sings every song the same way. it is a pity to confine and jazz at something haunting and a little boring, it could vary the tempos and staging, to make an album more colorful, more varied, more fun.
