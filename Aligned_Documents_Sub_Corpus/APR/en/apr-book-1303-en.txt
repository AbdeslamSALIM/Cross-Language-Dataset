with "la france in danger of islam," rene marchand takes the risk of displeasing the dictates of self-righteous. and he does it with a healthy heart. this is not a pamphlet or a literary exercise, nor a report to cabinet, but a book written by an academic arabist journalist, tone alert, based on undeniable facts, supported by a knowledge of islam and arab culture that only provides a long path of friendship. the purpose of this book is to open our benevolent illusions about the expansive nature of islam, while scrupulously respecting the character of this religion. away from the amalgam as a caricature of the innocent naivete rene marchand explains why we must be wary of a vocabulary that does not mean the same on both sides of the mediterranean, what if france wants to prevent jihad and reconquista it must immediately tackle a realistic policy of muslim worship on its territory. gaullist, drawing experience from the war in algeria, the author calls for a surge of political insight and a genuine dialogue with islam in its entirety to avoid lebanonization of france.
