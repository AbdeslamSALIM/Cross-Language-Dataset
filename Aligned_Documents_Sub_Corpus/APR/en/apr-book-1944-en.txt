this "collection" of letters is simply perfect! i loved the way chosen by laclos to express the idea of licentiousness prevailing at that period of history ... handling of characters by 2 heroes is quite surprising! and the perverse side is all the more shocking it is used in a level of very strong language, which does not detract from this masterpiece!
