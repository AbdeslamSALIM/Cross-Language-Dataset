this documentary, an hour and forty minutes, shows the complexity of an era. the commentary audio torreton is both remarkably well written and provides important insights. for example, we learn that churchill tried to promote an invasion of yugoslavia to try to counter the soviets in eastern europe. similarly, the transatlantic misunderstandings are clearly explained, de gaulle sought to restore french sovereignty as soon as roosevelt was in favor of "friendly occupation" and had even print banknotes of a new currency. finally, the moral ambiguity of the time is made explicit for if vichy and nazi barbarity are forcefully denounced the myth of "american liberator" and "france-resistant" are also questioned. this is a documentary reference, dense and exciting, full of fascinating archival footage, which will arouse the curiosity of many historic viewers.
