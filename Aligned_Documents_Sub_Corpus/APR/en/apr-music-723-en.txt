no need to expatiate on this group to me is what is best in alternative rock says "available" ... in the tradition of previous "one day remains" but with the effect of surprise less attention no shade is made concerning the quality of it, the titles are very very good ... "ties that bind", "coming home", "blackbird" ... i'm still shaking. tip: if you have the opportunity to see them live, do not botch ... you understand that this group is neither a rose nor a creed fm group ... but simply a great future of rock!
