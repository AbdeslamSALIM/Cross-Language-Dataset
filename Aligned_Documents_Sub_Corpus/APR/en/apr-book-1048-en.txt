poetry free ... available in any case, because poetry, not always. i bought this book because i love "free time". but i'm sorry. the composition rule of words must have been to write what came into his head. without trial. the result is rarely successful. occasionally a phrase is smile, because it is a poetic glance. and some poems are really great. but much of the book is trivial.
