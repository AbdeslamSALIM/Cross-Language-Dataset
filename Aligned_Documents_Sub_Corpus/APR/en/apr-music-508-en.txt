for years i've been a fan of kate bush, especially for the album "the sensual world" and "the red shoes." then the lady has disappeared ... but the enthusiasm remains, although i was desperate to hear a new opus one day. yet it's done ... at the risk of taking a drubbing, i'm not at all attached to this album. to me, this is not the same singer, the world is different ... where is the little touch of madness? where is the bold voice? and especially where the tubes? not to mention the melodies that tire very quickly. to listen but not urgent. for me, it's back failed.
