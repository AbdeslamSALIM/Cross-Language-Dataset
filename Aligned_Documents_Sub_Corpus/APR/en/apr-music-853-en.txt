with just piecemeal these 3 records, i used the windfall to see them together to make the acquisition. one can easily understand the magnitude of this phenomenon was the cause 25 years ago so all this has not taken a ride. title in full, is an avalanche of beauty, genius and mastery on the part of the 3 protagonists. a treat! special mention to the improvisations of the 3rd volume. pity the years passed, the concerts have lost some of their magic but do not spoil our fun and enjoy, in the meantime, this delightful reprint.
