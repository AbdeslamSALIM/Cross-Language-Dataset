motörhead's first album that does not form a trio. the group is totally revamped, pete gill (ex-saxon) comes to the battery with two unknown guitarists, wurzel and phil campbell finally (still in the band today). "orgasmatron" is meant more raw than its predecessor, the controversial but nevertheless very good "another perfect day." the album, like the locomotive of the pouch tumbling at high speed. nothing is cast, all songs are excellent ... and i confess it's certainly the only motörhead where i can not find a way lower than others. it really is a must in the genre. advancers stream priority all!
