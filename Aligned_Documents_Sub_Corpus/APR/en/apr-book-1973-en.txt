curious of all recent events, i was anxious to cultivate and read gavalda ... style flat for my taste, a history of divorce as live thousands of couples, no action, no reflection on the profound meaning of life ... it is not even distorted picture or in the dark or in humor, just a mirror real sad from beginning to end. where was the merit of such a book?
