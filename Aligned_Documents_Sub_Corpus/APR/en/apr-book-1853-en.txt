i was extremely disappointed by this book totally biased and sloppy in his demonstrations. i expected a bit more of a nobel prize ... but we must believe that the result still does not stifle the passions ... in all cases, the authors are so convinced of the veracity of their prejudices, they take shortcuts confusing, even for a scientist like me. a book partisan and dishonest.
