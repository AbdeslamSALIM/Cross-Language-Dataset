even wire story, same place, but not immediately between the volumes. shading main love between keita and another student of liberty. "in this volume there is the limit and forced relationship with sacrificial nakajima, he is obnoxious and does not meet keita, he form keita that need to be recognized at the school where he has not yet found its place! it protects by jealousy "these his thing"! the sex scenes are very detailed and present, from 2 other volumes out. personally i do not like this relationship, which only works in one direction: that of love for keita nakajima. volume 3 with endo is much more rewarding, close to the vibrant, with great mutual feelings ... fortunately, the drawings are always so beautiful. i hope that volume 4 will continue with the relationship of love "and keita endo, the most convincing of the three.
