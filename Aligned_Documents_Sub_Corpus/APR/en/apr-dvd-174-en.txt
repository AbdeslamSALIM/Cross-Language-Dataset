it is indeed a very pale copy of the u.s. version. this however has one flaw: some versions have a french dubbing done in canada which somewhat surprised (do not worry not accent you could cut with knife) ^ _ ^ now i am going to take a very simple remark. the u.s. version is sold on amazon. the u.s. version is dézonnée (i'm me and has procured only for blu-ray drive a playstation 3), and fully lined in french (to be validated, but the 5.1 sound is perhaps only available in english) ai i need to say more?
