once again, i just see the stupidity of people who rebelled against the 2 so-called messages from people heartless and contemptuous: they have reason! it's sad that he died, of course, was young, he seemed very nice and everything ... but that does not change the facts: the album did not sell during his lifetime and he was not well received by critics at its release. it's not now that this poor young man died as the album became great! do not bother to leave messages and any bland consensus, you had to buy his album during his lifetime, go see him live (tour canceled due to lack of audience) so this album is so awesome! no, that's for sure, it just gives you a clear conscience, that's good, it shows you the heart. meanwhile, as if someone just said a little lower there than here comments since his death ... long live hypocrisy, vive la france!
