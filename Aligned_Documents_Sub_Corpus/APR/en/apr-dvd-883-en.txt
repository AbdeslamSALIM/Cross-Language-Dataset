released in 98 and awarded the grand jury prize at cannes (the extract of the ceremony is now on dvd), la belle vie is divided into two distinct parts: the first one follows the rise of fascism in the years 30 through the lives of an italian jew and the second one is arrested in a nazi concentration camp with his family, whom he tries to cheer with plenty of imagination. that's "victory of laughter over tears"? strictly speaking the first part can smile, even should we not be allergic to the game of benigni outraged, but that in the so-called nazi camp ... is revolting. the extermination camp is portrayed as a place where one must work hard indeed, but where, with a little imagination, you can send messages of love in the speakers, make fun of the kapos, laugh with her children ... they laugh at that? some say that benigni wanted to make a fable but it is not clear at all. the first part of the movie is, if not realistic, at least possible and at no time has indicated any change of status, will slip into the story during the second half. someone with little documented risk therefore retain the grotesque image of the camps presented here, especially if it is his first contact with this historic tragedy. the term "revisionist" is a bit much but sometimes it itches. roberto next time, your story, do it elsewhere. or add elves and small animals that sing, it will be clearer.
