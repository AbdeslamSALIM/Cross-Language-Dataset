"if we call the science of sociology, human relations in organized groups, there is no sociology the next. " from this, ricoeur examines the possibility of a sociology from the next frontier. as the title indicates, we are rather at the border of a sociology of human relations and theology charity. the theme of the border and the boundary is important in the epistemology of ricoeur, but also in his ethics, and the curious relationship that operates between philosophy and theology: the limit is a place of reversal that does not designate as a beyond, it returns us to below. the "next" for him is a class that will seek to think radically philosophical. the world of "neighbor" is that relationships short, immediate, where most trade takes place between people who know. the world of "socius" is one of many relationships, mediated by circuits and complex class anonymous. recension of this title is presented in http://www.initiationphilo.fr/, as ricoeur (philosophy close).
