i had confused with another title. there was talk of a novel "unavoidable," critics have lauded, houllebecq is fashionable, beigbeder makes the licks. but it does find it in that book? personally i can not identify with one of his characters. i can not even feel sympathy for them, at most they are pathetic in the extreme. to appreciate it is probably profile homme/40 years / manic-depressive with suicidal tendencies. so?
