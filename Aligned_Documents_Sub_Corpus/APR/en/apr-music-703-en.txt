some of the remixes were not readily accepted, but all depends how they are made. i listened to the cd, hat mylène who chose very good mixers. the remixes are not exaggerated, they are excellent, particularly without infringement and i love you melancholy. mylène understand the purpose of the cd is that we wait, not sell, she is preparing a new album. think of it, and called him merçi before criticizing it as certain. thank you mylène
