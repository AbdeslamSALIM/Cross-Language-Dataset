this film is a reflection of the talent of actor will smith, that is void and of no interest. the abundance of special effects free is not enough to hide the mediocrity of the staging. the scenario does not exist and the music does not save everything. will smith monopolizes the film and plays again the clown. but he did laugh as he poor. the viewer disoriented by so unintentionally comic has only two solutions: either it turns the eye or he goes to bed. i chose the latter option.
