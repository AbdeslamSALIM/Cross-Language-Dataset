it's true we do not ask a guy who has already composed the most beautiful pop songs to be back on the pitch. so, it's a little surprise this album. after the first two songs for improvement, we attack a series of pearls, short durations, which are what mccartney has done better since ram or from abbey road. melodies both innatendues and yet to retain a surprising speed. this effect beatles, you know that feeling of having always had a song and learn every time. well that's it. note that the album is produced in a sober, macca plays all the instruments, and we appreciate the intimate ambience. a real surprise!
