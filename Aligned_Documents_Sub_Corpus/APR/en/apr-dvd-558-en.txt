you want to see a turnip big budget? go for it! more seriously, this movie will satisfy fans of richard gere and sean connery. the film is quite a place as a work in category learning "what not to do in film. ridiculous costumes, castles-models, a scenario as mawkish rarely (do not miss the scene where lancelo (r gere) tells his children) ... that the film knight general public, in the worst sense. i think the only way to appreciate this film is to see the second degree, a bit like it was a remake of "holy grail" of monty pytone. for a really good movie of chivalry, try "excalibur."
