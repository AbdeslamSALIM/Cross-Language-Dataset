after the soporific medulla, i promised myself not to buy a bjork album without listening to before. fool me once ... but once again i'm letting the memory of previous compositions of the beautiful, the days when it took less seriously, and i bought volta. conclusion after many plays: we still feel the embers of the artist who managed to combine experimentation and melodies (with "innocence" for example), but overall this album is a new object that archive and forgets. bjork can again caress the navel with the satisfaction of doing things different from what we hear elsewhere. those seeking something other than an object to be displayed on his coffee table will look to the previous albums, of those days when bjork took the risk of making songs.
