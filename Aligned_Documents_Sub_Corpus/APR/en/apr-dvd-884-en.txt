firstly, it is certain that this kind of film can not leave anyone indifferent, either you love or hate it. personally i adore, once a thriller does not play a cop who thinks he's a superhero. in fact, here is no hero in history. two competing camps and each camp is guided by one thing, madness. this film is for me a pure masterpiece with many characters all as mad as one another and whose behavior is unpredictable, unlike many films that we often lay. so voila this movie is just terrible and i advise anyone who is not never seen the show even once out of curiosity, you might be pleasantly surprised.
