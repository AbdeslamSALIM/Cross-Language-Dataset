ah, it is far, the good old days of the first 2 blues, rock of making movies and plan of love over gold ". now it of its formatted fm (money for nothing), (very ) long lengths (why worry), (ride across the river), and the ridiculous "walk of life" and horror "one world". the title track is really a mess: mark knopfler shows that it is worthy heir to gilmour, but he does a bit long, flat and totally tasteless. anyway, it does not worth a "where do ya think you're going," the good old days when they were 2 great guitarists. "so far away" goes to the rigor, but the only way to almost worthy of greater dire straits is "the man's too strong." otherwise, the rest and pathetic and definitely the worst of dire straits (apparently not shared opinion!) but "on every street" will raise the standard, overrated and less inspired than the dung before the final apotheosis of the live "on the night".
