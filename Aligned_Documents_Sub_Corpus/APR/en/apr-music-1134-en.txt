the group of one piece. a drum solo emblematic. coverage of lp and cd typical west-coast rock of the late '60s (1967, summer of love and light shows). outset, the first listening, i knew it was the stew, the zero of overrated. the drummer is miserable (see what baker and moon were able to do). the guitarist and the organist are worthy of inclusion in an orchestra tour dario moreno and johnny hallyday's psychedelic years (arf, arf, arf.). as the bassist (i dare not even mention the ghosts of entwhistle or fingers bruce), i hope he has retired to a trappist monastery of brothers located in the desert of death. rip in a gadda la vida.
