if you're a hardcore fan of "king of pop" and you do not already have this disc, then buy it. if you are curious or just a lover of good music, you hasten to look elsewhere! this is truly an album of poor quality releases at a time when the discs were produced every three months ... only the title "ben" might just touch our listening but the rest is really futile. let's move on!
