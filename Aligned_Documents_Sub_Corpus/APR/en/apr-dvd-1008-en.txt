k. johar is a god, he gave us one of the best hindi film history. the couple srk and kajol works wonderfully as usual! this film is a marvel, it is also my favorite. moreover, i find it very pure, very well done ... and finally, a mix of sadness and joy that makes us rejoice every minute! we can only love indian cinema after seeing kkhh!
