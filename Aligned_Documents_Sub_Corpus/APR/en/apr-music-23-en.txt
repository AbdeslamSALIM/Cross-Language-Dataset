i'll try to be brief because this product does not comment on long-i .. as always, with good will, tried to listen to some pieces of this thing indefinitely, but this is not fast, as the soup in question is charged by the meter is boring without any taste: 16 tracks almost identical and monotonous worthy of the best stews britney, pussycat dolls, rihanna and other singers r'n'bi clon√©es.un perfect format for nrj awards or things to fill the bercy unstructured kids to blow star'ac but in terms of artistic quality and creativity is nothing absolu.quelle pity to reach as many remier his musical roots (blues jazz soul rhythm &amp; blues) to supplement his account banque.certes she is very pretty and has a marketing section to hell .. that's all! so when you finally turn you away from these stars / starlets junk listen to real singers who sing with their guts and benefit from real musicians and composers / arrangers, yet it is not ca missing! see, eg,, "(and listen to on a plate, not compressed for pm i know how!). when this cd beyonce,'re on it to.
