actually, reading this i finally did not fully convinced. neither the characters nor style, nor does storytelling really seduced me. i found that once created, the script was struggling to move forward. some situations and replicas are redundant. finally, a small disappointment despite a history that looks promising. vargas has the gift to mount staged amazing and mysterious blue circles were in my opinion an excellent idea. an opinion is mixed, then, but i'll do a second test. remember that this novel is the first appearance of adamsberg. so it was perfect to begin.
