revel probably right about the background to know that international opinion (especially the french) towards the u.s. is too negative and has much of the backlash. but the book is too strong, the tone is heavily pretentious. the analysis of islam is that it is unworthy of being published. this is not even a well written book! the biggest criticism i have is that this particular book collects assertions without arguments (or rather, what is worse, with false arguments). i've learned anything interesting about the united states. reading this book is a waste of time.
