while reading pirate lady volume 1 (and two for that matter) have not been too boring: there are many surprises and adventures, all is well winded. heroin crosses full of events without leaving a lot of feathers or emotion (removal of a child anyway, multiple rapes .....). the complete saga without being unpleasant, many lack credibility, terrain is flat.
