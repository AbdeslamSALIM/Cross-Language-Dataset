after the controversial "ether song", this album is like a homecoming for the british duo. what is not wrong because the 2 musicians were self-produced "jackinabox" and played most instruments on the disc. but even if the sense of melody is still there, it seems that a certain routine has settled in turin brakes. yet, the album starts well with the bright "they can not buy the sunshine" and "red moon" and its beautiful variations. other pieces are linked together effectively but can not find the emotional power that usually comes by the band. this is partly due to olly knights a little below what he is able to vocally (except on "last clown" and "come and go"). hopefully this is a slump for this talented duo that, happily, is still as magical when played live.
