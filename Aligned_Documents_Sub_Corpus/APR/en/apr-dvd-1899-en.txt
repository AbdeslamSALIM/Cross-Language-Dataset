roolerball 2002 did nothing for him. a remake that has nothing to do with the original and the plot is very bad no interest. we do not believe for one second to this story. j reno is appalling in this role more than a caricature. but other actors are not only meilluers rebecca romijn stamos is doing. the scenes of rollerball are badly made and completely muddled even those of the original are better made although the film has over 20 years. we can not find any intensity. do not be like me saying rollerball 20 year later with mctierman well is not bad. purchased earlier in the original version dvd collector.
