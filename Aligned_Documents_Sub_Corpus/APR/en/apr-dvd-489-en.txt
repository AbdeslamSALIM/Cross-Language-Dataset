i have the excellent dvd edition with vf 5.1dts and i bought the blu ray in the light of further magnify this movie .... it missed! this edition is shameful for a blu ray. a track vf 2.0 while vf is 5.1 dts on dvd. the image is catastrophic for the blu ray. it's like being back in the days of vhs! in short, this edition brings shame to blu ray! bravo channel!
