i own both versions (dvd and blu-ray (qb)) and i think the br version really brings improved picture and details, and the stereo sound is really excellent. i have been through some cons disappointed by the disc, which contains only the bare minimum, or the film and soundtrack in french. no extras, no bonus, no comment. despite all the things to say about this cult film and its actors ... for fans, you should choose a version of "collector" if it exists in br. if only the movie you want, then the version at 15 â‚¬ suffice.
