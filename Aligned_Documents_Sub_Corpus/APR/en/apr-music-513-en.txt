it was fashionable at the time of vinyl to consider the taste of a rock music lover was equal to the degree of wear on the cover of his vinyl copy of "white light white heat." well well, i think my album on vinyl was in condition "mint". i always thought that we had overestimated the album that should find "cool" among rock critics. with the exception of the title song, songs are boring and not particularly great musicality. i suggest rather alban as "velvet underground &amp; nico" or "velvet underground" and in a lesser degree "loaded"
