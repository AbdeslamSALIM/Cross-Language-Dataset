we said since its release, lodger that would supposedly part of the 'trilogy' from berlin bowie. in truth, this 33tours was not even registered in germany, but just in montreux, switzerland !.... and he does not have any consistency of the 2 previous albums. this is a catch-all done haphazardly and without any interest, and especially rather misinterpreted! 'yassassin', 'red sails' and 'repetition' ... lives up to its name, are actually securities on which the musicians and bowie's voice is really zero creativity! even 'boys keep swinging' (one of the singles from the album) is completely ruined by the poor performance of the musical participants (bowie &amp; eno asked them to exchange their instruments !!!!... how preposterous idea!). how the record company has been let out such a horror in 45t is an absolute mystery! good advice .... forget to follow this aberration in the career of bowie
