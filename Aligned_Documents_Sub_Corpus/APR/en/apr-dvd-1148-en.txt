what about this series except that you spend a very very good time ... the zany and endearing characters, an offbeat humor, and episodes where the writers are really well thought out ... in short, a real treat. the 1st season is a real massacre ... but the 2nd is out of norm. tip: fv is unbearable ... was avoided at all costs.
