prince ... but what? prince unveils for us here all these facets. prince on this album really did not invent anything, but it remains to integrate these sources and these early inspirations: the raw funk, jazz, 70's rock, soul, pop honeyed early 80's ... and he experimented tries, especially mixing and plays and sings with a straightforward style and fit for him ... it's 100% prince in fact it's an album of genius, because prince is a genius, he can get away with anything. the first approchede this album may be difficult but the fact that pearl is trying, and i assure you if you like prince you will not find much to love this album. in fact i have the impression that the prince would come out before this album because this music is music that was parallel to the more commercial album ... yes it's true there are details such as voice ( embarrassing) past the pitch shifter, some solo synth do the sound would be the most wanted (anything less banal), some unnecessary interludes, this can sometimes be irritating, but as prince is a genius and geniuses are so direct in the approach to their art that are often irritating in some aspects (which has not been irritated by some exaggerations of salvador dali, for certain compositions of f. zappa, for some odd bases of miles davis? and yet are geniuses), these details disappear before the voice so raw and processed at once, the fender rhodes handled so well, the bass lines that kill these (real!) batteries death, these rhythmic guitars plan james brown and sly &amp; family stone, these types of guitar solos, hendrix santana, the ability to compose prolifically as not serious ... this album is the best prince album that i listened long ....
