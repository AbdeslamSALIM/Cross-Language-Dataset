that must be it a film for nothing. it is empty and hollow, it has neither tail nor head. johnny has always been a mediocre player for my taste: as soon as he opens his mouth i find him false, and i think more of some of his memorable reflections tv or bookish, only his eyes répliques.son is empty devoid of emotions, he can play that's johnny. must not be easy to run either, and then he would remind the tobacco laws, which are the same in belgium and france. as for lucchini, it should be channeled more when he plays because it quickly becomes irritating and unbearable. i do not mean supporting roles that do not exist, the film can be summarized in a dialogue between the two protagoniostes (sad caroline cellier). i wonder what good is a movie like that. it's baloney! why so much praise from critics?? it's just a little film full of impossible situations and improblables in a fictional scenario, however, or should be allowed. but there are too many shortcuts, turns 180 °. a final height of this scenario: silly magic spin. rest of the story of a fan?? podium mmouais.a hand, i do not think french cinema can compete with american films or english when it comes to music ( "ray, walk the line, commitments, still crazy, final taps, tina, the rose tommy, jerry lee lewis, la bamba, the virtuosi ..."). we were "les choristes", "edith and marcel", "good night little"!. lucchini still makes me laugh once or twice. but it is very poor and completely uninteresting. too bad the idea was quite nice.
