this album is one of the best heavy metal u.s.. i found skid row in 1988, and twenty years later, 18 and life always leaves me indifferent. this album is a huge success, which for me can be compared to appetite for destruction guns n'roses. with this exception, however, that skid row has a better balance between killing (youth gone wild, for example) and ballads fabulous (i remember you). to possess absolutely.
