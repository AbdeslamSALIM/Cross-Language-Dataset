by trying to sound modern and in the coup, the stones album here offer catch-all rather uninspired. note the ignoble might as well get juiced ... the guests are very many, that does not make a good album so far away from it. to believe that the stones are unable to be effective at 5, and unfortunately this is true on stage, with the slew of additional musciens and guitars mixed in the benefit of calvier ubiquitous and brass.
