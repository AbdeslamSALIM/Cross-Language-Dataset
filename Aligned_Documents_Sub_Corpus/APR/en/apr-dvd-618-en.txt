the young kassovitz connects on the observation of his company after the excellent and acerbic short film "white nightmare" with this "la haine". this film has created a real controversy and therefore undoubtedly a success with over 2 million entries in its output. in fact there are those who love and those who hate. but more than that i think we should emphasize the talent kassovirtz disclosure, the price of staging a rod 95 for this movie. already at that time mattieu showed a maximum investment (for the duration of filming he and team have been filmed in the city) and an exceptional grasp of the camera and actors. and what actors they have become indispensable today (said taghmaoui and vincent cassel notemment). now kassovitz has many proofs of his genius as a director (the crimson rivers and soon babylon babies yum!) and actor (amen) but it's really the hatred that has launched!
