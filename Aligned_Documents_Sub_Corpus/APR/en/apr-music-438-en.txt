i was very surprised to notice the 100% support of much of surfers on this album seems to me totally missed. apart from 2 or 3 songs that i like very much ( "deeper &amp; deeper", "bad girl" and "rain"), the rest is too heavy and it does not correspond at all to their previous albums that, at least, were great. this album is a radical change of style very disappointing, and i must say that i took a big pie when i listened, especially when we heard before masterpieces as "true blue" or "like a virgin ". it is full of sexual allusions more or less marked, frankly what's the point?? however, i tried to listen carefully to many times but it's really hard to swallow.
