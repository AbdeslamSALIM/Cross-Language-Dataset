on the eve of christmas garth fredrikson, brother mongo the magnificent, responds to letters from american children in santa nails and falls on the plea of a young girl to help him. all hands to fight among brothers frederikson who do not hesitate one second to come to rescue the poor child. what laudable but this story is appalling and fraught with improbabilities: yes it is possible to tear their ears without too much worry about it (unless you wear glasses), plunging into the icy water of the bay new york and leave immediately without suffering from hypothermia or to fly an airplane to a runway icy slalom between drifts. really nothing seems to stop mr. chesbro them when they decided to give in hollywood sensationalism. we'll forget this time george and we pass to the next book!
