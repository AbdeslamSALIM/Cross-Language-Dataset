upon the death of his mother marginal it hardly known, a rootless young woman comes to live in the house the deceased shared with two men adrift. we love this film (despite a few cliches and a staging fairly neutral) primarily for its people if it wants to know and share their unconventional lifestyle. the audience reacts as the character of scarlett johansson: first an annoyance to both parasites idle, two old alcoholic loosers, and the gradual discovery of their past, their complex relationships, their extreme attachment to the deceased whose death is center of history. relations of affection is ambiguous spin slowly with her daughter, who is her mirror, embodies youth and beauty radiate again. the film is an investigation and sentimental family, but also the nostalgic quest for a lifestyle far from the materialistic demands of today's consumer society.
