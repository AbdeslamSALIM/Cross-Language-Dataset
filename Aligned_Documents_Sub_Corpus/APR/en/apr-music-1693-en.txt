in the late sixties, the meeting of 5 english musicians from different backgrounds (jazz, blues, folk) created by this unique sound and style. the virtuosity of the guitar renbourn and jansch, the pure voice of jacqui mc shee and jazzy rhythmic thomson / cox are not the qualities that pentangle but their meeting and the unit created. solomon's seal is considered the best album, but "basket of light" and the first pentangle album in my opinion the same level. pentangle is unclassifiable by his style, but their sound is recognizable from the very first steps.
