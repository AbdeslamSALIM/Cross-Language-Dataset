watching this movie i do not know if i was really disappointed because i was not expecting something exceptional! but at this point i still was surprised. many complain in the comments how to rotate the image, personally i found it confusing and i loved. for cons the game players rings false; the beginning of scenarios creates interest and then falls into anything! when is a french film worthy of the fifth element?
