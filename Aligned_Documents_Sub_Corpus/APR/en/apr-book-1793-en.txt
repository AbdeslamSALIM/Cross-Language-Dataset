long ... too long ... very very long ... 525 pages of which about 300 are useless ... too bad because the idea is quite interesting ... but my god how boring .. but how boring it really must wait patiently for the last 100 pages to get a little suspence well deserved after the 450 pages of waiting. otherwise the rest is a continuous description of the school days of the heroine, and it remains fairly irritating all over the pages as it continues to be awed by the beauty of edward: as it is beautiful, my god what a beauty, but is he aware of its beauty .. etc. ... etc. ... opt for the movie ...
