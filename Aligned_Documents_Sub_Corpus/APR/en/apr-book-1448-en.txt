i love this series, although not revolutionary in the world of shojos shows us a very nice love triangle. fuko is still as funny has to ask lots of questions about the fact that it is not pretty compared to the two boys. as usual ichi is always so mean to her but now i see he really loves. daiyo becoming nicer it is probably hiding something. in short, a very good series. note: this series is 22 volumes.
