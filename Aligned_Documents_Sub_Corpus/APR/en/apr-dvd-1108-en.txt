a little worse than the first, but much higher in the second term scenario. it's really well tied, it remains predictable at times, but it was still entitled to some surprises and some ingenious connections with the first two episodes. as regards the special effects cons, this episode is far from being the best. dinosaurs are more or less successful depending on the scenes. but the image smooth style "digital camera" can still well back in action. to see if you're looking for dinos.
