notorious debut album ... well i think we'll try to go ... and i took a big slap! a single flow, even i would say perfect! classic pieces, i quote: "things done changed," the burning "gimme the loot", "machine gun funk", "ready to die," the excellent "juicy", and so on .... wholesale essential album, a new breath hip hop, mixing one side and a dark side happy, dancing ... a hip hop album as it is more often simply! as usual the best always go first ... rest in peace biggie!
