the viennese artist has just released the excellent electronica label morr music's most successful project. fusion guitars and keyboards in a warm electro planing, light and twilight both. the 2nd cd is a good trip alone. a consultant to most connoisseurs as the uninitiated: this music is a treasure trove of sound.
