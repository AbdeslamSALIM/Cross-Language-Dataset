dave grohl has passed the age of surprises. it is probably too old to go on territories innovative and rightly so. what is more surprising however, is the freshness of spring last opus of foo. while the last album but still enjoyable at times seemed to repeat somewhat, grohl and his cohorts show a big fish on their last disc. seemingly invigorated by the excellent double what was 'skin &amp; bones', the foo fighters we swing a dozen compounds smoothly strung, always on the same framework but oddly effective. this is particularly the case for the single ( 'the pretender') or the excellent 'let it die'. a set of all the hands of fans ... and others.
