for me the great originality of this book is to be grafted sensitivity "female" on a genre more accustomed to the massacre with swords or axes (take your pick mate). the character, rhapsody, is a woman, a healer and singer fleeing an abusive former client at the time of his difficult start when she had to prostitute themselves (it starts much!). to succeed in escaping it pretends to be the sister of a pair of disparate formed grunthor (the gentle giant killer) and "brother" (fearsome assassin). in so doing it reveals the extraordinary power of his voice managing to make a charade (the unlikely siblings between these three people) certainty and accidentally changing the name of "brother" who is "achmed the snake", allowing d 'and to escape an eternity of servitude to the great enemy, the f'dor. the f'dor, fire spirits seeking to destroy the world on fire and recurrent threat throughout the series. achmed rhapsody forces then to follow in their flight makes them cross the world from within! a strange friendship appears so between those three things so different, a bit like an elf, a troll and a goblin joined together! this tension is one of the things that makes the book so interesting along the trials that await the trio, and it demands so little male rhapsody of kindness and pity which put a bit of sweetness in a world of gross. i finished the three volumes of the series (each divided by two in french) and is also well until the end. and in addition there is a beautiful story of thwarted love, but which appears only from the second volume prophecy.
