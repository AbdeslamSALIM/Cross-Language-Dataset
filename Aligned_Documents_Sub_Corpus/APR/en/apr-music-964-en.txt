in interpreting the theme of "old folks" by trumpeter miles weightless ... to the surprise intervention of master john coltrane (on tenor) on "someday my prince will come" (version 1) and his solo in "teo" ... for performance inspired saxophone hank mobley and wynton kelly piano throughout the album ... for stimulating presence of paul chambers (bass) and jimmy cobb (drums) at their sides ... an exceptional disc!
