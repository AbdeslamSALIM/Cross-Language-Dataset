here we judge the quality of a movie, not history. a flag has three heroes who are asked to do a show to raise funds, but that the consciousness of not being the real hero .... render unto caesar what belongs to him ... even honor the heroes of myth, that of the true picture. the story is certainly interesting, but the film is too long and the scenario it is very short, very short; it borders on tedium. there is no plot, some good shots without recalling "the longest day". besides, i doubt that there have been so many ships and armed forces for this battle so special? the rest is the nostalgic, the document easy to operate. what will the japanese version?
