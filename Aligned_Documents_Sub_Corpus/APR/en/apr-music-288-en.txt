the charismatic leader of depeche mode released their second album after the long tour "playing the angel". a first observation of entry, the album sounds more electronic than its predecessor and is closer to what he does with dm. normal, as the drummer and a member of the crew participated in the writing of this album. titles emerge lot, including "i saw you" or excellent "kingdom", but at the end of listening to the whole album, you say that it is superior to his first test but this is not an exceptional album, but all in all enjoyable. for fans of dave.
