the first impression is not to watch a james bond .... nostalgic of the "james bond tradition" period sean connery, go your way. here we have more to do with a superhero, a clone of batman, jason bourne and superman. at any moment we expected to see the bad guys out of kryptonite. air time required. one has the impression that bullets bounce off his chest. impressive stunt, he flew almost in the air. yamakasi scene (is it a film produced by luc besson?). in the next film will be the one they slamer ptit coup. all the ingredients are there to please a young audience. the writers do not get bored, creating a "james bond origins" in the mid-2000s. no logic screenplay? no problem doing a clean sweep of the past. logic of the cash register. that said, i decided to give 2 stars to this movie. first, because the film is far superior to bonds last 25 years (rather difficult challenge i admit). then as the film leaves look pleasant, provided we do not expect to watch a james bond. by cons soon forgotten once seen. another popcorn? yes thank you ...
