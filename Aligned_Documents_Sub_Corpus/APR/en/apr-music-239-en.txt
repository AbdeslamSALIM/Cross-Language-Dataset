after one last album not exactly revolutionary, was expected to turn placebo. placebo, led by brian molko androgynous idol of the young ladies seemed to stand still for a few years, being confined to stay in this recipe makes a pop energetically very accessible. but now, by dint of turning, mayonnaise finally have a questionable taste. alas, meds is far from the account. sleeping with ghosts far included some good titles, as much meds is provided. the anecdote is the keynote of this new album very disappointing. the ultra-fans may appreciate but others, go your way. you turn instead to the first album, much more convincing.
