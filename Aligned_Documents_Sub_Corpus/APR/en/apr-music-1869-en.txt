a great album of downtempo / ambient / idm (delete - or not - as appropriate)? nothing revolutionary in the music of global communication, of course: no beats and crazy textures to autechre (they evoke irresistible, at least the first album), no brilliant minimalism to aphex twin (one of the selected ambient works ), just an outstanding sense of melody, production and ample air and some real pearls ('14 31 ', '8 07'). few of ambient albums that you can stream loop without the risk of dozing off, it is part. note: gc was released in 1998 a "replay" of the chapterhouse album 'blood music' entitled 'pentamorous metamorphosis', as remarkable as it is difficult to find.
