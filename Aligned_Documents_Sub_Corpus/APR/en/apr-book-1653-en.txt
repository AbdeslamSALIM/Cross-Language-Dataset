with "marshes," lansdale was a masterpiece, a classic in the making ... it is immediately caught by the stifling atmosphere of the early novel and the shadow of "man-goat" which lurks in the rural south and 30 years deep enough to captivate any fan of crime fiction. unfortunately, the author has avoided falling into manichaeism, see the outright speechifying, which gives quite hallucinatory passages of sentimentality coming parasitize the narrative. worse transplantation serial-killer, oh so modern and emblematic of the problems of our time does not always in that rural america before the war and the author must use large resources to try to us to swallow snakes (the medical background of the bayou is a specialist before the time of sadistic killers, with a hypothetical "manic sexualis" as bedtime reading ... mouarf) domage, a pity, because without the ideological digressions where the beast naive concession to commercial imperatives of the serial-killer, "marshes" could compete with the very best in modern crime fiction.
