"the big nowhere" is pure ellroy. enthusiasts gather here all the ingredients they like in this author and yet can not help but remain vague about his hunger ... we parade ellroy's narrative as a recipe: it is good and effective but lacks the charm that episode of the poisonous "black dahlia" or the mob spirit of "la confidential". it's an effective transition between the two novels mentioned but we would have liked a more innovative theme, a hint of madness added. the fans will appreciate but those who do not know the author would do better to focus their choices on another volume.
