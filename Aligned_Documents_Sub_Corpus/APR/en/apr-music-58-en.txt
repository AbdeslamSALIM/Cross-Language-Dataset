good point: the cover looks like the last album by johnny cash! otherwise: apparently it's an album to stream several times, but who wants to experience it repeatedly? i listened in full but i have taken no pleasure. i do not understand that his words are addressed. joggers on sunday for example, what is this song? i do not understand that it can touch. for me this album is quite dry and not leave me any lasting impression.
