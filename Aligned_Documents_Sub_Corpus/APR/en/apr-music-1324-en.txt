... over the past ten or so years: sealed by a glaring lack of inspiration. this composition is not, alas, no exception. it is far from tasty melodic temple maudit (probably his most inspired music of the now tetralogy "indiana jones") here, like star wars iii, john williams is content to take much of the themes that made the success of previous episodes (with a tribute - not to say pompous - at first) that he does not even evil to enrich, develop or decline. two "themes" original (only) for this soundtrack: "call of the crystal" and "irina's theme" that will not be remembered because of indigence melodic rather surprising from the maestro ... you can also regretted the absence of "magic" and "fantasy" in this score, but the music can not compensate for deficiencies that are, above all, cinema!
