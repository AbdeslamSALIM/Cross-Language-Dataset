the book reads at once, it's pretty gripping. it describes also the morals of the world through hollywood, which gives the book a little later satirical far from unpleasant. the plot of the story is fairly conventional, but the outcome is much less. as a bonus, a little reflection on our goals and aspirations on both professional and private plans.
