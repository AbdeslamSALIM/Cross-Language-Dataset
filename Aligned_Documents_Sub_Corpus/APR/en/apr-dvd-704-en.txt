beautiful music (although i regret danny elfman), very good actors, special effects succeed, an extremely simple but effective plot. the charismatic villains (especially venom even if you do not see much that the black film). but what would it be without a blockbuster action scene? and indeed within it are amazing! only star wars transformers or are subject to the same level action scene. the best of the saga!
