add more to the other comments, this film is poignant, sean penn is stronger than dustin hoffman in rain man, michele pfeiffer is beautiful, little dakota is moving, as friends of sam, they are endearing. then i would add one more star to 5 that i gave, and i give to sean penn's oscar has not been to this beautiful film, moving, avoiding the cliches of the genre, but we tells a great story that gives us a different perspective on life, yes, it's a good lesson that we give sam and lucy diamond, a lesson of intelligence offered by people from inside.
