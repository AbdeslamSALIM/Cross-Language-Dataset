2nd volume of this exciting story. after an opening in the top 1 volume, this book reads at an impressive rate. one can not help but devour every moment of the day until late at night when the story really takes all its fullness. stephen king manages to make us get under the skin of the characters to better feel their fears of children and adults. he's so good that these sentiments are still present long after closing the book. what motivates even more to reopen it to try to find some rest. one can not help but read this volume after the first and you have every interest in having the third already in hand to avoid being short for more than a few hours before purchasing. only the first volume, it leads us into an exciting adventure and really stressful (in the good sense). so have no hesitation, buy it!
