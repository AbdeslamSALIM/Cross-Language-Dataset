after the disappointment of "elements part 1 &amp; 2", i waited with some concern the new stratovarius ... having personally and infinite loved episode i stay here again on my hunger. there are certainly some good riffs with catchy titles but all still very average, it lacks inspiration &amp; the group seems to falter. for fans only. too bad.
