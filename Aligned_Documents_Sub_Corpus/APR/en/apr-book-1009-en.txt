i discovered douglas kennedy and i wish you explain the importance of this "novel". what is its meaning, where does he come? no response: the writing is simplistic, the dialogue heavy. as for the intrigue, does not speak. i wonder the hype has been around a book (the author, this is my 1st experience, so let's be indulgent). in any cause boredom and the total impression of having been scammed.
