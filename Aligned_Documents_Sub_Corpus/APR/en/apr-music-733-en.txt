a 1st album so perfect, it is rare, yet savage garden have won their bet! darren hayes, an unmistakable voice and unique, and daniel jones, the guitarist, we are traveling through this album with rock sounds ( "break me, shake me") or with the slow ( "truly, madly, deeply" "santa monica ")," to the moon &amp; back "is better here than the single version because it is the intro too, but i urge you to get it, because once you have it, you'll never want without it! pity that this great duo also be separated (after more than 11 million albums sold to it) and have only 2 albums to their credit. in any case, mine always turn on my plate!
