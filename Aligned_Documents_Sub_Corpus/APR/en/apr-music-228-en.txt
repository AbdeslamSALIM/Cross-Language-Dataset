muse fan since début.muse was my favorite band for many months (or years). showbiz is a true marvel, a swab of music. origin of symmetry album is the consécration.enorme. absolution, not bad, but we feel that it starts to decrepit. but then black holes &amp; revelations ........ i was really disgusted by this album really poor, without interest, blank (black holes) and muse disappoints me lot with this album as mcdonalds. fast-musik which feels incredibly warm and without surprises. i have the impression that matthew bellamy exhausts his monstrous talent in what he does not feature at all. i hope to find a group powerful words that give me the sensation as of yesterday ...... muse! not buy!
