i just watch the colorized version of "fanfan la tulipe". it is a success. the colors accentuate the images d'epinal, with costumes military uniforms court of louis xv. gerard philippe fanfan camp with panache and a zest for life overflowing. this bursts the screen. christmas is the perfect roquevert sergeant major. marcel herrand is louis sv legends, with his arrogance, his "apparent impartiality". gina lollobrigida is lovely and has a screen presence. genevi√®ve page is an actress of class that derives much of its pin-jer. a movie review for the simple pleasure of a good story and dream that "good always triumph ends"!
