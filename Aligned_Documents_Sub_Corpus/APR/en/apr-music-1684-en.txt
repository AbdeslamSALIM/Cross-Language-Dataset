yes, this last album of marillion is terribly flat. and it's hard to say one thing here, a group that carried me so high during all these years. as if the magic had disappeared, titles add nothing new, a canada dry, a album that has the taste of marillion, but that we may go to his head. since i buy this album, i ironed the entire collection from "script for a jesters tear in marble" i think that changed ... no, the magic is still in the old albums, but disappeared here. i hope this is not a sign of age, tired of playing rock, or the beginning of the end .... what a pity ...
