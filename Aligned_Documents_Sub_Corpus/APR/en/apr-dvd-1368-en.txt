this dvd recalls the beginnings of jose garcia as brilliant actor, and confirms gildas de caunes and as worthy of the pantheon of paf. it takes us back a decade back to a time when the spirit channel was on top of his form, in which nothing (or almost) was prohibited. in quick succession, with manatane, the blank, de caunes garcia and informative message, canal + video rebalance us a good dose of laughter, crazy, sentences worship, hoping that it will reflect the pattern string. when we did not die of laughter, we rather regret that time and we catch ourselves in always wanting more.
