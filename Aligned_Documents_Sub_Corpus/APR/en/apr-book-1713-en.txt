bottero this book is intended primarily for people who have already acquired some important concepts about the mesopotamian world. the author carefully and finesse the worlds of writing and the theocratic principle, or "mythocratique" mesopotamian societies. i highly recommend this book, which offers a clear, warm light on the attitudes and concetpions men of that time.
