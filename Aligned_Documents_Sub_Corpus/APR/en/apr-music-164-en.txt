tokio hotel will be part of those groups that have not lasted more than an album. the production is excellent, but apart from the singer who seems to write the text, when the music is composed to her by the producers of the album (former producer of motley crue, the corrs, ...): we are again back in the days of stock, aitken and waterman. here is a good group for teen without references. tokio hotel is located between musically tatu and evanescence: you can listen well, schrei sounds good and is full of energy, the ballad "rette mich" is touching, but it lacks originality and ... authenticity.
