i love josiane balasko as a person and as qu'atrice, but then i'm not hooked. besides, i have not managed to finish the book (which happens only rarely), i found it flat, no real surprise. too bad because the subject can be very interesting. i imagined writing a more truculent, but maybe my expectations were too specific they get to actually enter in the text or maybe the way i imagine josiane balasko skewed my reading.
