big fan of the period "short and funny episodes" of this series, i find exhilarating, the book leaves me 6 on my hunger, like the previous book. once past the slight discomfort associated with telescoping medieval / ancient rome i'm bored. the spectacular scenery contribute nothing. a short counter in 3 stars is a short counter. the writing has lost its bite and the transition to fiction is long enough tedious, i think it does not. given the oversupply in sets of quality kaamelott comparison suffers badly and lost its originality.
