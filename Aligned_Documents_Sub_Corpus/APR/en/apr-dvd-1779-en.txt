nothing to say, very good dvd, great concert, great voice. all music are occasions except one (beelzeboss or singer is more david grohl). this is the only black in my opinion. you learn not evil as the group's life (relationships between singers, a few of their lives ... etc.) which is very interesting. major more for subtitles in french version of american dvds pure happiness .... voila dvd to own for any fans who respect each other.
