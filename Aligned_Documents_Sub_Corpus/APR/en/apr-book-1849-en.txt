if you already have the "beginners guide to mothers" by the same author, no need to invest: the content is almost exactly the same! long passages are copied word for word, only the organization is different. it smells of scam. also i am not convinced by the nutritional advice of ms. bacus she seems eager to diversify the supply of babies from an early age, and seems unaware of breastfeeding ... i am disappointed.
