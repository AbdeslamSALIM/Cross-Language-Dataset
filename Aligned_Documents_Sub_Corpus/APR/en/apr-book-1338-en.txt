what one expects from a little book like that is advice (very) practical to live day by day .. and not how to become the perfect sex shopper by offering such a dildo! no technical advice but a small set of fantasies to enforce the majority of time outside the home (in restraurant or in the office of chief!). brief nothing new .. disappointing!
