a beautiful novel, really. a great story, exploded like a kaleidoscope of memories of childhood, however, tells the extraordinary story of owen with a beautiful logic. one knows the end from the beginning of the novel, and yet, until the last page, one knows nothing. we know from the outset that the story has a tragic end, the narrator leaves no doubt soar. what we find in these pages is that it is also wonderful, miraculous. the last chapter took my breath away, that i almost did not read it because i thought i knew and i did not want to read a play announced! and as always, great humanity and love in the beautiful passage of irving.
