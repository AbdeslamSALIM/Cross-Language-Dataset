c ca a real album of british rock, and the best since the 90's with probably other cd like the second coming of the stone roses (one of the idols of noel gallagher), or any other, and the first of its désormé cult band. if you do not know and that you are a fan of rock (almost impossible!) thrown over you like crazy, the 2nd album is exellent too, 3rd and 4th are also good but a little below (in terms of creativity in anyway, since their sound remains the same) ... which makes england better in the last fifteen years?
