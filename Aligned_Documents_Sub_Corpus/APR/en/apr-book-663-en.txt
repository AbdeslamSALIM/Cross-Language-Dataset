i am glad to have time for me to finally read this book that seemed promising but i was very, very disappointed! the writing is bland and boring. i had to hang with any of the characters. the story is flat and without bouncing. fortunately, the book reads quickly (just a few hundred pages) ... too bad because the theme is interesting!
