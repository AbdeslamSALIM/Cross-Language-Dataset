We compared the results of the classifier with those of three baselines: (1) the first one classifies all the NPs in the “Outcome” category, (2) the second one classifies in the “Outcome” class all the NPs that contain a concept belonging to the ontology, finally (3) the third baseline is a simplified version of our classifier that only uses a subset of our features (we removed features based on ontology as well as all the features that are based on discourse relations).
