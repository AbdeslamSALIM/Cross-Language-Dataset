Paraphrase acquisition is usually evaluated on the acceptability of substitutions in context, and only small-scale human judgments of the results give an indi- cation of the lexical functions captured: [13] reports that 90% of their pattern- based extracted paraphrases are valid, mixing synonyms, hypernyms and coor- dinate terms, but with no indication of coverage.
Similarly, [14] or [15] precisely evaluate the presence of synonyms on similarity lists on a small subsets of syn- onym/antonym pairs, which makes it hard to extrapolate on the kind of data we used, where we aim at a much larger coverage.
