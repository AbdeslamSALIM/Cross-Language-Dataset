ABSTRACT Semantic Annotation of the French Treebank using Modular Graph Rewriting We propose to annotate the French Treebank with semantic dependencies in the framework of DMRS starting from an annotation with surface syntactic dependencies and using modular graph rewriting.
The article presents some new results related to the rewriting calculus: the use of rules to make a link with lexicons, especially with the lexicon of verbs Dicovalence, and the introduction of filters to discard inconsistent annotations at some computation steps.
It also presents new results related to the rewriting system itself: the system has a larger coverage (causative constructions, rising verbs, . . .) and the order between modules has been studied in a more systematic way.
This system has been experimented on the whole French Treebank with the prototype GREW, which implements the used rewriting calculus.
