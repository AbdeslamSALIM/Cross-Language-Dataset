the product type (Books, DVD, Music or Video) the rating (originally a numeric value r between 0 and 5).
For these experiments, r has been translated into qualitative values: bad (if 0 r < 2), neutral (if 2 r 3), and good (if 3 < r 5) the proportion of helpful feedbacks2, i.e., 0-25%, 25- 50%, 50-75% or 75-100%.
We define hierarchies on contextual dimensions as described in Figure 3.
The number of contexts in the context hierarchy is jH(product)jjH(rating)jjH(feedbacks)j = 6 5 7 = 210, the number of minimal contexts is dom(product) dom(rating) dom(feedbacks) = 4 3 4 = 48.
