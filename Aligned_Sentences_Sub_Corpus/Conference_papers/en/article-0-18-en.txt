SummarizeLog Algorithm SummarizeLog algorithm is a greedy algorithm successively summarizing the queries of a log using QSL operators until a given length a for the summary is reached.
The QSL expression used is that maximizing h f -measure while changing the log.
Two strategies are defined for the choice of the expression.
The second strategy checks for each pair of consecutive queries what is the QSL binary operation maximizing h f -measure and applies this operation.
Then the strategy looks for on this result, the unary operation maximizing h f -measure (strategy 2).
