The size of this set depends on the strictness of the threshold controlling the aggregation of a cooccurrent to a sense seed but as we are interested in getting homogeneous senses, the value of this threshold cannot be too low.
Nevertheless, we are also interested in having a definition as complete as possible of each sense.
As senses are defined at this point more precisely than at step 4, the integration into these senses of cooccurrents that are not strongly linked to a sense seed can be performed on a larger basis, hence in a more reliable way.
