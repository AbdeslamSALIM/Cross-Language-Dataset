Abstract This paper proposes a generic mathematical formalism for the combination of structures.
The control of saturation of the final structures is realized by a polarization of the objects of the elementary structures.
This formalism allows us to bring to the fore and to formalize the hidden procedural mechanisms of numerous formalisms, including rewriting systems, dependency grammars, TAG, HPSG and LFG.
