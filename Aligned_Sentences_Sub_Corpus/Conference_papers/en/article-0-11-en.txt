For a dimension Di, we consider that members are arranged into a hierarchy <i and we note m <i m0 (or m < m0 or m0 covers m) the fact that the member m0 is the ancestor of m in this hierarchy.
Given such a cube, a cell reference (or reference for short) is an n-tuple hm1; :::;mni where mi is a member of dimension Di;8i 2 [1;n].
