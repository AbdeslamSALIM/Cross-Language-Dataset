This work is at the interface of speech recognition and analysis to IF modules.
More precisely, the speech recognition module was adapted to be able to deliver a chain partially or completely analyzed into IF.
This was done by using a class-based statistical language model for which classes directly correspond to IF entries.
Section 3 presents some preliminary experimental results obtained with this methodology while section 4 concludes this work.
