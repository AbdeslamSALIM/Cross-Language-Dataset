In particular, we identified some prepositions to be removed as they were: • erroneous, this is the case, for example, of aussi (adverb rather than preposition), which is present in the UNL dictionary as a preposition, • obsolete or very rare, like emmi (from TLFi), devers (from Lefff, TLFi, Grevisse) or comme de (from DICOVALENCE).
We also checked the semantic features given in the sources and removed erroneous ones, like avec as locative in SynLex and DICOVALENCE.
