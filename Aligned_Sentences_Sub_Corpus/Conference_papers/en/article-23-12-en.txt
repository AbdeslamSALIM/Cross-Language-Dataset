JeuxDeMots: a GWAP for building a lexico-semantic network JeuxDeMots1 is a two playerGWAP, launched in September 2007, that aims to build a large lexico-semantic network [9].
The network is composed of terms (as vertices) and typed relations (as links between vertices).
There are more than 50 types for relations and relation occurrences are weighted.
The weight of a relation is interpreted as a strength, but not directly as a probability of being valid neither a confidence level.
