This paper consists of three sections.
The first section defines the notion of regular polysemy and gives a quick overview of studies devoted to the description of regular polysemy in WordNet.
The second one exposes our goals and explains our method to reach them, which consists in the \computer-assisted" creation of polysemy patterns.
The last section presents our results, which take the form of a classification of these patterns and a measure of their regularity in the most recent version of WordNet.
