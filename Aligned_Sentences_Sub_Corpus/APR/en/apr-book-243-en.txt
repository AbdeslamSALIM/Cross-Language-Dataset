i confirm the other comments, cugel is dishonesty is sometimes staggering stupidity thrown in for the trapped, he does not think he acts when he needed to steal an object he does not think his flight, but only has the object.
this happily using it as much out of the traps in which he falls he is by ingenuity that turns quickly against him.
even if i am not a fan of heroic fantasy it is a very good book.
