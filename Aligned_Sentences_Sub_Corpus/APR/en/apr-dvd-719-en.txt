i bought this dvd on the enthusiastic comments of users.
my children are 7 and 9 years.
to see chihiro's parents turn into pigs, abominable, to be alone ...
i do not recommend this movie for small children.
there is no age limit on this movie.
yes, the pictures are beautiful and yes, he exudes a certain magic and poetry of all.
but i do not see the point of imposing such a long journey with the characters and tension horriblissimes hardly bearable for children.
