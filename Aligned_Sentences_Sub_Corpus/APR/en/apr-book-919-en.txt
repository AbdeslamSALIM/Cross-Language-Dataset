without claiming to have seen everything, i traveled a lot by plane, both in economy class and first in businness on air france and several american companies.
i have never been treated as described in this novel that is as less than nothing (euphemistic understatement in english).
in short, this novel is so grotesque and establishment of the plot so long that it becomes laughable.
a new style of literature is invented the novel terminal - the novel station.
