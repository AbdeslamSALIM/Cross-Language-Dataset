the worst is to think of trees that has been used to produce the paper for this book.
but it remains ecologically distressing because after reading a few pages, there is no doubt that few readers (just look at the position of the thing on the amazon sales) will have an idea in mind, recycle the paper again.
finally, the book has a purpose, if not meaningless.
