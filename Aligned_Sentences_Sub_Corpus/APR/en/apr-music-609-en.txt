the title is bound to annoy fans keane which i belonged, with the first 2 albums and has already seen several times in concert ..
what about this new album ....
exit the melodies on the piano exit a certain sensitivity and fragility that emanated from their previous albums, up to a wave electro soup with layers of synth melodies and bland soulless, perfect for the elevator or supermarket.
i sometimes had the impression of listening to the latest robbie williams.
certainly everyone's tastes, but keane had dug the groove of a pop elegant if not extremely innovative, and this new album really has nothing in common with its predecessors ...
listen to the advice before buying, especially if you liked the first 2 .....
