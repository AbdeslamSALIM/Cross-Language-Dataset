excuse me but although the sketch made me laugh separately, trying to swallow all in one night is like trying to eat kilos of foie gras in a meal.
early on feasts and then gradually it nauseated, it is bold and in the end it was a terrible time passing.
the vulgar is funny, but only in small doses.
