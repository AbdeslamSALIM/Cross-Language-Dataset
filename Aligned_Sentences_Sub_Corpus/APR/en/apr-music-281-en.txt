mika has almost the name of a swiss cow, he sings well, his hits are addictive.
after listening to this album several times you wonder what he does.
the overall lack of consistency, it looks more like a compilation of tracks radio than a cohesive album and thought.
the whole is unequal share in all directions and ends up more like the circus (just like the record cover) or james blunt on acid than a true album.
mika has laid there an album that will make a fashion that can not speak more so in less than six months and more all in one year to the next artist "hype" that will win the general public for his fifteen minutes of fame.
