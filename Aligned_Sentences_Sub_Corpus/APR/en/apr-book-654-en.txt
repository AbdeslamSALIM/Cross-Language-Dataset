even if this book teaches us many things about the sleep of the child, i am rather shocked at how the baby is considered.
it seems to me that a baby 3 to 6 months to even need a lot of arms of his parents, warmth, and when the author recommends the setting especially alone, not to fall asleep in your arms, and not to breastfeed for the lull, but the cons of leaving cry alone, i wonder how we can afford to give such advice.
there is no better for the child to feel rejected and did not trust him.
the author is obviously not shared sleep (cododo) and yet, if we believe people who practice it works rather well.
in fact, one gets the impression that in this book, it is only a question of comfort but parents should not forget the needs that can have a baby (love, tenderness, protection).
it is true that babies need to download but could not we just support them in these moments of crying and learn to listen without feeling guilty.
aletha solter wrote a beautiful book about this "crying and tantrums of children and babies," she tells us to listen and accept the baby cry and we learn how a baby can repress his emotions teats, doudou, sleep and feeding, i recommend to all young parents.
and for those who want to learn more about cododo read "share the sleep of her child," we see things very differently afterwards.
we have always responded to all that he needs to feel respected and loved, he was breastfed when he wanted (without surallaiter either), we practice natural hygiene, ie it has no diapers since he was born because we communicate these needs disposal and we are taking him to the toilet and finally it has never been nor pacifier or security blanket, very often been worn and is a child very pleasant and sociable as anything there is no truth and i think the author really lacks flexibility.
