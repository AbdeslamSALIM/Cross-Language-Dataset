i've been tempted by this series after having heard and read rave reviews about it and my opinion is quite positive: we must recognize that rome is a neat and stylish set, which cleverly mixed and history great little stories , which is instructive.
i particularly like the function to obtain data on the habits and customs of ancient rome are watching, very interesting also.
one thing is certain: i will be looking closely at the season 2 when it is available in zone 2, on or around october 3.
