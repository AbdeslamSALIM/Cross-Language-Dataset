jagger has had to learn this in business school he attended in the early 60s before becoming a singer: before a worldwide promotion, putting a product on the market.
and then, before the "steel wheels tour", the cd "steel wheels".
who looks like a disc of stones of the 80s, that is to say the stones trying (without success) copy of the stones 70s, who copied the stones for 60 years, who copied them chuck berry and muddy waters.
it is unnecessary to dwell on the fact that one is with "steel wheels" very far from achieving the heights.
so charlie watts sound like metallica drummer, bill wyman will file after this record weapons in indifference general wood and richards riffent and solotent mechanically jagger and pretends to be concerned to attract shoppers.
a question hangs in mind: those who find it quite hard, even brilliant, they know how, records of stones?
