the german writer and director fritz lang (1890 - 1976) directs "the pioneers of the western union" in 1941.
in the 1860s, western union has set up a telegraph line across the western united states, under the pulse of abraham lincoln.
an official of the company, creighton, was rescued in the desert by vance shaw (randolph scott) wanted for a bank robbery.
recognizing creighton vance hired as a scout for the western union.
but installing the line to salt lake city is disturbed by attacks indian (sioux), renegades, theft of horses.
this western offers a succession of magical shots.
magnificent scenery, meticulous detail, vitality populations.
fritz lang turns as if it were a feature of high-quality scenes of everyday life.
the telegraph company, the saloon, the street, working, fighting, fighting men in the fire.
cinema of fritz lang seems to me a fatalist.
the man does not escape its fate or the consequences of his actions and especially his feelings of loyalty.
i look so forward to play again with the grand marlene dietrich.
the second dvd has provided more than 90 minutes the films with his 8 mm camera, by fritz lang in 1930 and 1940.
the adversity of the mystical nature, wild, its pitfalls, its impressive reliefs in the image of the great cactus rise skyward.
