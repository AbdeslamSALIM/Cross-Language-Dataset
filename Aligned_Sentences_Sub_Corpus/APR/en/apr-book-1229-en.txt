even wire story, same place, but not immediately between the volumes.
the sex scenes are very detailed and present, from 2 other volumes out.
personally i do not like this relationship, which only works in one direction: that of love for keita nakajima.
volume 3 with endo is much more rewarding, close to the vibrant, with great mutual feelings ...
i hope that volume 4 will continue with the relationship of love "and keita endo, the most convincing of the three.
