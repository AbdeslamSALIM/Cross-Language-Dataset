this book reads at the speed of the lightning (like what is the size of an eclair?) is rather amusing one finds the scientific answer to the questions of life every day but which we did not response force.
note this is really a list of questions and answers associated with the advantage of focusing on the most basic questions (why dogs have all, or almost black truffles by expl.).
good reading and good fun
