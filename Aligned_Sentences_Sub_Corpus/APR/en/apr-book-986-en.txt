yasmina khadra not only knows nothing about iraq, but he knows nothing about the middle east.
not found in this book nothing of what makes the atmosphere of this region, none of the debate in iraqi society, nothing but a fantasy opposition between east and west.
the author tried to reconstruct the reasons why people become terrorists.
the problem reduced to caricatures.
while the author claims to make psychological analysis, he can not escape the clich√©s.
