this album is the latest installment in a trilogy of wandering, after plummeting commercial unmasked, the group decided to renewed contacts with old friend bob ezrin, legendary producer of the destroyer.
the group tries to find his roots but ezrin, more attracted by the orchestral arrangements and conceptual albums, proposes to recreate the atmosphere reached during the recording of welcome to my nightmare by alice cooper or one of the wall by pink floyd.
the result of this gamble is the divide within the group: simmons and stanley decided to follow ezrin, frehley violently opposed and carr-the newcomer, deciding to close its jaws.
finally the old rivalry between ezrin and frehley still bears fruit, almost all the contributions of the guitarist was refused or simply hidden; annoyed by the attitude of his comrades and seduced by the follies of alcohol does frehley never will reconnect links his former accomplices.
kiss nevertheless, we offer perhaps the band's most interested in his career even if the experiment was complete failure.
