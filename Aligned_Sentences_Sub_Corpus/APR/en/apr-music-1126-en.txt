after a series of excellent albums all over each other, the group of roger mcguinn acc√©lrateur release the album and issue a plea, but not devoid of charm.
there are of course the eponymous ballad, crystalline and overwhelming.
the rest is rather spoiled, too see the long version of a classic dylan and boring (from the first listen, not bad!) "jesus is just alright".
not a wonder, not a stew but not (as we have read elsewhere).
