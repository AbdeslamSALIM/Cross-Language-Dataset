neither the characters nor style, nor does storytelling really seduced me.
i found that once created, the script was struggling to move forward.
some situations and replicas are redundant.
vargas has the gift to mount staged amazing and mysterious blue circles were in my opinion an excellent idea.
an opinion is mixed, then, but i'll do a second test.
