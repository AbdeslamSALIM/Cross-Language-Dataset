what can i say except that i have absolutely not clinging to this new soundtrack by john williams, the talented.
only the theme that mutt is not bad, the rest, well, no emotion.
the themes of the first three films were much more than taking fourth.
i think if some bo-phile like this latest installment of j.
williams is probably in the construction of tracks, which is quite original.
in short, the music left me unmoved.
we must also say that it is difficult to make good music on a grotesque film.
