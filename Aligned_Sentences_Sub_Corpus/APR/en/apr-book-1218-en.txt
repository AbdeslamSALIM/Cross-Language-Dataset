i'm a fan of the series, and i must say i was downright disgusted by this album!
not only the drawings are sloppy, but the more we feel that this album did a goal: make money for its authors!
they have completely betrayed their main character!
eg thorgal has always sought to conceal the gifts of her children, and now he is asked to show them to everyone ...
and there is still much that is dreadful!
in addition, at the end of the album, they are careful to specify that the next album is called "shiv valnor" by chance when the series was flagging, it appears the old characters that readers love ...
