when her husband's mistress, pregnant until neck comes knocking at his door, alexandra sees his life collapse, especially when paul, her husband decides to leave.
experienced rider, but lost in his grief, it forces the horse to jump an obstacle, and there's an accident. 6 months hospital.
so much for the incipit.
no major effects, but many of sensitivity and emotion.
be humble before the power of the horse, do not want at all costs dominate the tame or control.
to listen and let it go.
a great lesson, a transmission of knowledge, beauty riding high school dance with him is a very beautiful movie.
a single flat on the end, too open for my taste, but apart from that, it's all good!
