second novel in the bibliography of stephen king, salem is the only one dealing with the myth of the vampire.
while the beginning may seem a bit long to some, the action was too soon to start until the last pages very intense.
some scenes are truly a spine-tingling.
paper has not put in any hands but a counselor for fans of the genre.
