in one word: "grandiose" number of michelin stars: the maximum possible.
on the audio: an eclectic set list in all though for my liking the album "the visit is over-represented compared to others like (including parallel dreams).
i liked songs like standing stones, dicken's dublin, in praise of christmas, snow or tango to evora instead of cymbeline or bonny portmore &amp; kecharitomene in place of marco polo ...
the least: if extremely disappointed by the highly compressed version of lady of shalott total of 9 of the 14 verses were deleted &amp; we pass an original version of 11 minutes in a live version of 5 minutes or about half the previous version of live (live in paris &amp; toronto 9min 30sec).
perhaps i liked both versions of the bonny swans with the final part (solos) a little longer.
too bad also that about the mystic's dream, the hearts of the intro from the original studio &amp; not directly sung live by the presence of vocal or the musicians themselves at the scene.
finally a pity that the solos on never-ending road have not played the bagpipes on the irish as the most original musician who takes care of this in the studio &amp; on stage but equally beautiful violin &amp; cello .
