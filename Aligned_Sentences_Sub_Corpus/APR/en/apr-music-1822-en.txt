here, the songs come and go all alike.
the rhymes are pretty poor, the flow rather feeble and falsetto becomes frankly agga√ßant.
speaking of cliches, is not very surprising to find nelly, snoop, and other popular rappers.
very few good elements to allow the album to take off.
two to three titles can be distinguished, but it is fashionable to ask: when the album shifts to 10 months is to improve, right?
