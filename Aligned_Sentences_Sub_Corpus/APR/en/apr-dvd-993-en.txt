a war movie interesting but unfortunately full of errors!
u-boot dating immediately after being bombarded not find anyone at the surface, americans who seized the discovery of the enigma machine, on the german destroyers with numbers that do not exist, torpedoes which, fortunately for the americans are totally defective guns who will stop it (but hey, this is classic) and many others ...
it is true that americans have given much in this battle, but they still took a beating sacred by the u-boot early 1942 into the port of new york ...
he is very loyal and underwater shots are simply stunning: it's good travail.
mais it was interesting that the acting is also "pushed" in the wolfgang petersen film "das boot" reference essential in this area ...
