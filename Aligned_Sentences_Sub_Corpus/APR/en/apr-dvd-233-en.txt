a story that dates back stomach and burning the neurons.
if we do not focus at 100% involved in this masterpiece while the film seems annodin.
in contrast with minimal intellectual capacity this film is revolutionary, it is a true reflection on the identity of the man and his purpose in society and especially his role in it.
with the wonderful interpretation of the two actors (brad pitt and edward norton), this film takes guts from beginning to end.
it is a flm to provide the faster you will not regret it !!!!!!
