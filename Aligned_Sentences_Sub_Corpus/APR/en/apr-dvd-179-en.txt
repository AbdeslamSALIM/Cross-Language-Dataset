with extreme violence, very innovative graphics and a soundtrack novel, the film was lying in wait.
but the result is convincing, despite some passages that we could have done (freedom, democracy, die for his country (too clich√© perhaps)) this movie is very appealing.
even if we do not play to cry, turnaround or sudden revelations, the scenario is tied (and very faithful to the comic book).
the action scenes that make the reputation of the film is very violent and not recommended for young audiences.
snyder has not skimped on the replays, we can feel in the action.
in addition to bo rock (which is well suited to the film) the digital image and we show this film as an array of oil paint, fun to watch again and again.
a peplum worthy of the name that surpasses many "troy" but did not catch up "gladiator," bravo anyway;) a.
