after a very strong and powerful album inspired concerts and more and larger but still very good, this last album was released after 3 years of absence and it is bad compared to previous and what we could expect from placebo.
even if two or three pieces stand out this album is sealed by a majority of unworthy titles for this group who are just there to decorate on a budget.
it lacks inspiration, adds nothing to the band's career, production is pompous and music with the addition of brass that attempts hide poverty musical r√©elle.
