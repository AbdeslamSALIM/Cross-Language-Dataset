uv novel that reads well but unfortunately leaves a sense of unfinished business.
the story starts well, we expect something, but ultimately it does not happen much.
this is for me, something that may seem reductive, the latest novel joncourt who has accustomed us to much better in "idol." but out of curiosity, it might be interesting to see the film adaptation.
