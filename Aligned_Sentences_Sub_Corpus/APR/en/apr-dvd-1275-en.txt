"the dead poets society" is one of my favorite movies.
there is no french subtitles and dubbing french is quebec!
in comparison with the vhs that i still treasure, there are replicas that have been translated quite differently, not counting the french voice of robin williams.
in short, fans refrain, keep your videotapes and zero points for the publisher buena vista that takes us for fools!
