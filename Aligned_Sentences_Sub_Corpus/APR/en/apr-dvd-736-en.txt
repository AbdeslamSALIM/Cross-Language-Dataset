this war film directed by werner herzog was inspired by a true story.
we find the talent director from 1965 to the eve of the war in vietnam.
held in the jungle, the enemy viet cong and allies lao, inflicts the worst torture and humiliation.
it is of course a courage and extraordinary determination to want to say, day after day, in order to escape, "rather die a slave." heroic examples we have are mentioned from time to time.
i think jean moulin, who died of torture he suffered, certainly, but victorious, free.
this film is great.
it demonstrates the truth of the required total commitment to freedom.
