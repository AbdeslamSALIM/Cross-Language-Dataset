can not think of gypsy music while listening to this cd ...
moreover, the shadow of his friend emir kusturica square on the first chants of "the gulag orkestar".
but less volatile than the production of filmmaker musician, beirut held a quiet but fiercely minimalist music haunting, medieval view.
arrive early "postcards from italy" which is probably the best song and makes me think a little archive.
then, with mount wroclai, the amiable clown reminds us that travel form the mind of ireland, its ports, its beer, etc..
anyone (including myself) who gives the folk music of the buttons have an interest in making prescribing this cd as soon as possible: addiction and recovery ensured guaranteed!
