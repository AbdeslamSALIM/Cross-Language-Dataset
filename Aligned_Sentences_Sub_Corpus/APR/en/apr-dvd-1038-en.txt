i saw the film three episodes, then saw them in long version dvd.
but, like king kong, once the joy (relative) of the discovery last there remains nothing more.
the illusion is exhausted, and we see the film as it really is; empty.
empty, because the dialogues are useless, because the pictures are haunted by shadows of characters, because there is no d history, no connection, the scenario is only a pretext to illustrate how much light the text of tolkien.
empty, because once we know the film, boredom is deadly and the expected arrives big special effects that force is too boring.
empty, because peter jackson is not a director, he is a teenager of 40 years filmed in close-up, drooling lips, models and large animals that break everything.
no restraint in the staging, no intelligence, debauchery prevails, and beautiful effect.
nonetheless recognize the excellent work of the team of special effects, and those costumes and sets, music.
recconnaissons actors to clearly highlight the characters.
but peter jackson, too respectful of the original work to appropriate (although it would have been had he is capable), too fond of his big beasts of its beautiful scenery he filmed from all angles, we issued a show without a soul, far from a conan the barbarian or the first star wars.
the magic is missing.
