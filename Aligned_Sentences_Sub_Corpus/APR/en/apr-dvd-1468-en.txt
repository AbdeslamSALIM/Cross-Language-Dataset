the film begins by showing john travolta (billclintonis√© for the occasion) tearfully listening to the story of an illiterate disgrace.
a young political activist, present at this occasion, he believes in and agrees with the governor for help in his campaign for the presidency.
the varnish is quickly scratched the governor is a tireless womanizer, and s' it is close to the people, simple people, it loses an especially long time to hide his wrongdoing.
this is not a monster, just a man driven to lie about his private life so we do not judge on these facts alone.
but the film also shows that political discourse formatted, the lies that we are politicians are often (always?) a necessary evil for one day reach the head of the country and finally, do what you think.
