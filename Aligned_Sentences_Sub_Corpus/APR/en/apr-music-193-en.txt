it was something that i can not explain, it is sincere, natural, gay, i love to meet and chat with her, she reconciles with life, that i sometimes find hard to bear, we live in a cruel world, and lynda with her songs and her melodious voice makes me dream, i very much regret not having known sooner.
what else to say, continues lynda, you make me feel warm inside!
