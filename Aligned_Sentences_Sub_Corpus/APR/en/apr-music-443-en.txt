"outside" is a surprising break from the funky black tie white noise ".
from the beginning of the album, something is not working.
album too confusing, too long, it gradually loses interest in the concept and even music, which is a shame.
yet all seemed very promising, especially the reunion bowie and brian eno.
from this mixture of kafka and prodigy, we note that some tracks are much more interesting if they are listening out of context: "hallo spaceboy" (including a great remix by pet shop boys), "the heart filthy lessons" "outside," "the motel" (used wisely by patrice chereau in his excellent film intimacy), "i have not been to oxford town" and "stranger when we meet" which closes the album and that bowie had already recorded for the soundtrack of "buddha of suburbia".
