it's a dying caeur to accept this as a worthy successor was desired, fantasized ...
a group never produces a single album of this caliber in his career.
he had to have this in mind before embarking on the discovery of dig out your soul.
this immediately eliminates the fat disappointment, one that all fans of the group took in his face to listen to be here now, standing on the shoulder of giants, heathen chemistry and to a lesser extent, what's the story and don 't believe the truth.
dig out your soul confirms the return of oasis to a level more honorable, already begun with the previous album.
with titles like "bag it up, which opens the album, the single the shock of the lightning i'm outta time, a beautiful ballad written by liam or falling down, the gallagher brothers confirmed their talents author / composer but forcing.
the rest is in effect in the future, often mid-tempo with obvious lack of inspiration ...
noel insists on singing on some tracks and it's a shame because her voice is and always will fade next to that of liam.
sung by him, and high horse lady falling down have taken a different dimension.
the bombastic to be where there's life is tiring.
the turning and is not got nothing could have been good songs, but oasis are lazy.
ultimately, this new album from oasis leaves a sense of unfinished business, feeling that the potential still exists but it is only very rarely used.
that the two brothers gallagher will make the obvious: they have definitely lost the sacred fire of their debut, this desire to do battle with the world allowing them to say, chest, they were " fucking greatest band in the world! .
