one knows the end from the beginning of the novel, and yet, until the last page, one knows nothing.
we know from the outset that the story has a tragic end, the narrator leaves no doubt soar.
the last chapter took my breath away, that i almost did not read it because i thought i knew and i did not want to read a play announced!
and as always, great humanity and love in the beautiful passage of irving.
