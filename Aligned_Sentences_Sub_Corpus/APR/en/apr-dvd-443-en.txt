let us say right away, i packed this film, for several reasons.
this is the episode more adult, more mature, more violent, darker.
so for the adult that i am is my favorite!
the pace is fairly argued, the film is exciting from beginning to end, the special effects are remarkable, the music is very successful and the interpretation of quality ( although i still have that reservation on daniel radcliffe that i find sometimes unnatural, but still a marked improvement).
for the dvd itself, there is no problem to get to the technical and bonuses are quite varied.
