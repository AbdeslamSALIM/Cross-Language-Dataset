after a few demos they released their first album "the somberlain" remains to this day a great job rather black.
then comes the album "storm of the light's bane", still in black but the spirit in which we feel a real process, hence the term dark metal that corresponds to the mixture of black and heavy.
when i listen to dissection, vibrates as much as i listened to some riffs maiden or slayer.
to me, this album is indispensable for all metal fans whatsoever (besides who cares the "style" before such a monument): the riffs are staggering originality, drummer and provides much the environments are fantastic.
this album is unfortunately their last drummer is currently in prison for murder.
but who knows ...
perhaps a new opus in 2004?
