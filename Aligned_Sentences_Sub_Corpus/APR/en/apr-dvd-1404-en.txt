the episodes are very good although old.
the image of the dvd is no longer correct, we could expect an recadrement image but good.
the menu is very bare, no bonus, no language selection.
that the selection of the episode.
by cons, 1 missing episode.
the series has 17 and not 16 like on the dvd.
i board this dvd to you all.
although designs are old, they are of good quality and history of episodes is quite fun to discover today.
