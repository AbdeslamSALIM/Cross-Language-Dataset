axxis is a german old enough (the first album in 1989) who practiced a hard rock melodic, pleasant but not over and that, especially since time machine has begun an interesting evolution frankly.
the hard / heavy machine time left place a heavy metal with elements of hard rock paradise in flames yet to evolve doom of destiny and power / heavy melodic speed even melodic (note these moments always hard rock very pleasant, especially at the chorus!) interpretation top level, excellent production, excellent and varied tracks (no throwing), i definitely became a fan of axxis!
aspect symphony, the catchy choruses, riffs effective, quality song, nice singer incursions (lakonia, since this time machine, which takes up more space on the new album), while this album is a little gem of metal!
finally, i would say qu'axxis proposes in his music elements gamma ray, scorpions, queen and many more!
