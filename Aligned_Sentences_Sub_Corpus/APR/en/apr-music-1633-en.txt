this album is the turning point in the band's career, after the death of cliff burton and the arrival of jason newsted!
after 3 albums of classy, metallica lulls us with an album inaudible.
no finesse, noise from end to end (with the exception perhaps of "blackened" and "one"), a ubiquitous baterie.
