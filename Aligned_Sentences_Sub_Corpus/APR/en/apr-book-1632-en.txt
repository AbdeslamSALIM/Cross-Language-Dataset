i have never read a book of "chick lit" as unattractive.
fortunately, he has few pages.
it'sa shame because the idea of an exchange of mail could be interesting.
it failed: the atmosphere is cut and gives the impression of a series without beginning or end of cliches without interest ...
i very much regret having already bought the second installment in the author ...
