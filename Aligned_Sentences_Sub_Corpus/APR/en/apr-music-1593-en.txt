indeed his majesty "dandy prime" does not take many risks out this album of covers of songs by dylan, he has already given in this gerne exercise in appropriating the songs written by others.
her "must" remain in my opinion the light cover of "jealous guy", beside which the original is pale.
the previous album by the crooner "as time goes by" was quite successful, although i felt he forced a little more annoying crooner turn precious.
so, here's cover album (above).
totally agree with one commentator on the voice much more pleasant and melodious than bob, nasal and unbearable, whose songs are often better performed by others than himself.
c'eet fun i even understand the lyrics!
usually marmon√©es by dylan.
the pieces are undeniably the foot of bryan ferry, soft, cool, even if (it tastes weird!), i had a soft spot for the resumption of knockin'on heaven's door guns (that's about everything i listen to them, with one in a million), while previous reviewers, apparently hate this version.
but now, i'm a fan of long standing roxy, including album of reformation that take almost all the road.
no purist at all, also love a lot of ferry's solo albums.
but all these times, it ends up tiring.
like joe cocker incapable of writing a song, and that everyone is damn albums recent copy-paste the previous ferry takes more risks, and must be content to honor these contracts.
yes, with a bonus dvd on which he recently found mckay, manzanera, high fly.
enough to have her voice (though sometimes limited, see the live aid 86, and everyone including him had been crushed by freddy mercury), and a crooner-style type-sof-class relaxation.
it is surely preferable to the album, including an even twice (like the single calibrated to please their record company), rather than going out like a metronome disks occasions, which is only a surprise comparison, without great unknown.
au boulot mr ferry.
