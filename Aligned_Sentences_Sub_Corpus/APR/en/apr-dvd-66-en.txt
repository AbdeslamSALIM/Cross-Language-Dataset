for a long time since we've seen a series as great and original.
i found season 1 on the cable channel showtime in the u.
i thought not enough words to describe the series.
i thought season 2 would not be as tasty as the main plot was resolved since the entire season 1 is based on research of ice truck killer, which proved in the end the brother (lost) by dexter, our hero serial-killer.
after this final so shocking and disturbing, how can we invent another story about dexter and his sister debra?
season 2 offers another fascinating story as full of surprises and twists.
as the first reflects the very special atmosphere around dexter and his nights out in miami.
he must be very careful and especially that hides the evidence of his "crimes".
with you to discover.
if you liked season 1, you'll be pleasantly surprised by this 2nd season.
i finished season 3 a few months ago and i can tell you that producers still amazed me.
i wonder how the writers are working their imagination to achieve much success in a series that was supposed to last one season.
and the saga of dexter is not ready to finish.
we were promised the season 4 in the fall (in the u.
the characters are among its strengths in the series.
dext (michael hall) is equal to itself, deb (jennifer carpenter) is crunchy wish, rita (julie benz) is always so sexy, masuka (lee) just as obsessed.
the other, laguerta, batista and especially the excellent doaks sergeant (eric king) makes us want to watch.
among the new characters, an fbi special agent played by keith carradine (david's brother) who oversees the investigation of the bay harbor butcher (the butcher of the bay) and will not be insensible to the charms of debra morgan.
and the enigmatic, beautiful and sulphurous lila (played by traditional english jaime murray) who claims to be the soul-mate (soul sister) dexter and its damn complicated life.
