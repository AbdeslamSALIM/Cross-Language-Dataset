that is what this novel: a man who has gathered ideas from elsewhere and who wrote a fiction on the facts.
what makes this novel so controversial is that these ideas affect us all.
indeed, who has never dreamed to be enlightened about the secrets of the grail?
but brown says in the introduction that everything is true.
why do not we should believe in the letter?
some facts are based on hypothetical speculation, and because if the grail would be to the general public, it would certainly be in a language a little more worked ...
i was surprised (if not shocked) by the literary poverty of this book.
brown wanted to go to basics and forget just as his readers were ...
despite the weaknesses of his work, brown takes us on a pseudo-pseudo-hallett adventure where one enters the den of secret societies which we have all heard (that makes them less secret of the fact) and that our curiosity is piqued.
indeed, curiosity is the engine of success for this novel.
one detail, however, it is called "da vinci", the author largely avoids the life of this great man was leonard.
brown has not served us with details, rather rare, which served its history.
in short, fairly bland novel, in fact, which is more than a fad that will pass literary posterity.
as for secret societies, i expect a real book that speaks specifically
