the musical goes to the french more and more evil!
after the stodgy "gladiator", the pretentious "don juan" this is the bland "sun king", written and designed for fans of star ac!
the music is a simple sequence of notes and words of words put together!
take us instead records "creatures," "chance" or "the return of fantomas", shows low budget but with talents in it!
