this is the best stephen king novel and is the best adaptation of one of his novels.
the atmosphere of the film is almost like the book (since some were too crude or downright impossible to adjust so the film is less impressive) but kathy bates is made for this film and deserves far her oscar, she signed one of the best benefits screens since the inception of cinema.
