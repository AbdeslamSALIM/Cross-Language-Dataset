this album bears comparison with the previous "viva la vida or death and all his friends" (already a sum of "b-sides", in my opinion), which can not be dissociated.
those 2 albums are made of the same "base material".
probably recorded at the same time or almost (i admit my ignorance on this point since i read any newspaper article about it). 8 tracks in total, including 2 ( "lost" and "lovers in japan") are re-balanced shamelessly almost identically from the album "viva la vida ..." to it.
she has gained a little extra soul. - "postcards from far away" is a pretty little melody on the piano (really) ...
but i saved the best for last, the title alone justifies that i file a comment:" lost + " this song is so ridiculous that she has fortifying virtues.
i can well imagine the scene: - "uh, jay-z, there's a group that wants you to add a track on their way. -- ok, but then i am the toilet ... "that falls well j'te passes the microphone." listen to this result completely indigestible to store in the selection of the finest plouf year.
the rapper (jay-z) has become embedded at a time, like a tuft of hair on the soup.
the musical universe of jay-z and coldplay are as distant as the geographical locations where they have respectively to catch her.
as for mixing, it is worthy of a quick hack to intern with a free software!
abo-pathetic. "who loves well, chastises well": i do not agree at all with this adage, but for once i apply it.
i love this group since its beginnings but i think there is here a lack of professionalism and respect for the public, and money, i have never met this level (or is it a joke .. .?).
