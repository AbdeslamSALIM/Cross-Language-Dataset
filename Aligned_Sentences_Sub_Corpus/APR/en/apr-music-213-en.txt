udolpho album is a sumptuous, sublime, beautiful to die in ...
and i weigh my words.
in apparent simplicity incredible (the songs are just acoustic guitar, cello and vocals [and a violin on 2 songs]), no overproduction, music developed here is actually an incredibly rich, the way of nick drake.'s voice, oscillating between belle and sebastian and leonard cohen, takes us inside and we did not let go.
it does not add any effect lachrymose style (as sometimes a little too much from people like damien rice and tom mcrae).
in short, an album of folk dry and perfect, as i knew we could do in france!
