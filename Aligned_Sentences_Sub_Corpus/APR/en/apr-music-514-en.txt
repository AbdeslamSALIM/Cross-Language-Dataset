group has never been as hard as overstated and reassessed.
obviously i put 0 stars, but there must be at least 1 star then too bad!
the velvet is not good (especially this disc anyway) but the worst is that the aura and reputation of the group is such that it wants us to believe that this is music contemporary american.
