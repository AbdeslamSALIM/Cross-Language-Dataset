already, and foremost, i find the cover of the beautiful pocket (detail of eve or the love in white sandorfi)!
and then of course there is this history, beautiful and deeply moving.
this is not the novel eliette abecassis i prefer.
a style may be too simple for my taste, but this style is also the voice of this woman, modest and pious, who expresses no pathos, feelings, then it becomes coherent and clear to read.
finally, there is this theme, very strong, the religious laws, the laws of man, so inhumane, dictated in the name of god, and kill ...
so there is nothing more to say, this novel becomes a universal testimony, and i can not but be affected.
