i am not a fan of celine dion but i was pleasantly surprised to see this dvd.
the live is great, no false notes, and bonuses are really at the height of a live dvd (some artists should take note).
celine dion offers a magnificent spectacle, documentaries on it, meetings with his fans.
in short, i recommend it to all curious!
