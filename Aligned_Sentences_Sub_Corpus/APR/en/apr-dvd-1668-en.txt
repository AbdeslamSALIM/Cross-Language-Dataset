i totally agree with dubois just above!
the discipline seems really nice but made inaccessible by the teacher!
it assumes you know the steps, she tells us to do "together" and we do not detail anything!
she frequently not a mood half-sullen, half-jaded (the stroke of the clock on the choreo 2 is the best!), it is not every teacher or result!
she gives classes as dance classes except the dvd c 2d and can not imagine any (the "releases" the choreo step 2, it falls out of nowhere is hallucinating!)!
we feel we will never get there and you get nervous alone in front of his position (which is not the goal sought ...)!
between his "no transition" (sung), "last" (sung) or "the same thing to the left" (sung, argh, it's annoying) you can not go!
worse his choreo is, of course, not explained before, and above all right and far left!
i'm at the 5th viewing and there's nothing to do: it does not coordinate!
the passing of heels-ass "single-single-and double" but ultimately not if you get excited, it's normal ..
frankly, i have several courses of jessica mellet and it is a-do-ra-ble.
it describes well, is not the gradual, still nice and especially encourages and recognizes when she is wrong!
this is all stupid but it is comfortable!
short, i have no doubt that claude m'fouillou an excellent teacher but true!
his choreography is very beautiful, very nice but inaccessible.
but well, if you want to put you in your sport, especially stay motivated, fitness zone c very well, but fitness zone with jessica mellet c better together!
and when you are "fitness" professional, you can make this dvd afro fit ...
ps: the dancers of the choreo 2 are nice, they!
