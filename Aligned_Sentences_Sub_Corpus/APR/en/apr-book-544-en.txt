this work may be regarded as the pinnacle of the last "creative period" before nietzsche fell into a horrible disease until his death.
he wrote this book in 3 weeks between 10 and july 30, 1887!
in his "genealogy" there are some basic ideas, some principles of ethics as "good and evil," "guilt and conscience" and especially "the ideal of asceticism, which hold their central place throughout this work.
but the author does not address any of these "concepts", these "ideas" used in accordance with the philosophy of morality.
it is not so interested in what they mean, have value to some entity, not in what is their value or merit normative.
