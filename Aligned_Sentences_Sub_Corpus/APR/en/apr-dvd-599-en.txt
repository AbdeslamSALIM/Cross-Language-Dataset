this series is the worst we can do pop rock to "djeunz" but often rotten, sentimental stories with 2 balls and a thousand miles from reality (it is clear that friends who are all part of the elte models i have personally never seen it !!!).
the worst is the pseudo-philosophical r√©lfexions that pollute the episodes, like "war is not good if it gets shot it hurts" or "if she leaves me, i badly and my heart does not bear" with a music business behind and a good end for the teen to finally say "yes, good always triumphs" short ...
not recommended if you are out of pre-adolescence, if you want to evolve into a society different from those assigned codes redneck, and if you want to teach a minimum and attend to real reflections look the fourth dimension or the x-files will be much better, or better then read all these classics that are cheap, as the works of victor hugo or dickens ...
short to not advise as very young as 13 years ...
