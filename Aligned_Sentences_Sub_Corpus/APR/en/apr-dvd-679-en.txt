i had read positive reviews and i agree with simon s√©riphage.
i'm not hooked on history, rather superficial and trite.
the costumes are garish, the scenery is beautiful but want the work of the computer is poorly controlled and it shows constantly.
some special effects are frankly duds, the image is smoother, it looks like a bad game video on a machine that lack of ram!
the landscapes are modeled and hop: "copy paste", the city's king makes cardboard computer can not hold a candle to zhang yimou, who, himself, really heads lumber!
