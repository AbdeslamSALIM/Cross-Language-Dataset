my beautiful parents had praised the show.
so needless to say that when i saw this dvd promo, i threw myself over.
honestly, we swim in full plate. "the women act this way," the men say it "....
so yes, it's true, you can sometimes find them.
but this is rare.
especially in couples now freer and less influenced by what is considered to be the time the role of man and the woman's.
for indeed, this show does not disclose absolutely nothing new about behavior between men and women.
and then i do not understand what is supposed to be fun in this show.
we smile may be from time to time.
but to wriggle out laughing and find it hilarious .............
i suppose that after 30 years of marriage, having been educated in a society may some macho, we found very good.
but if you are young, with a mind a little more open than that, i doubt that this flow of pre-designed amuse you ....
