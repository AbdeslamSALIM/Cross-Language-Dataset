go, 1 star for the successful special effects, and 1 other to the unintentional humor.
despite the mystery that the director tries to cast on the futuristic bunker where our hero, we do not care a bit, we fear almost knowing that, far from being original, it might even be disappointing.
then the second part of the movie happens, accumulating disasters: primarily the weapon of the future that is more ridiculous, a gun that is used as a fishing rod.
at first i could not even laugh because i could not believe it.
then, the band of mercenaries, "meuchants" film, initiating a chase infernal totally unnecessary and unlikely 30 minutes to try to catch up with our heroes (unsuccessfully? ...
well yes ...), sequence which extends the length of the film, finally putting an end to our illusions.
once we know the trouble to lie, it's a turnip.
with the shift action was right in passing ...
tin tin tin ...
we hit bottom?
towards the end everything becomes truly catastrophic including the blink of an absolute bad taste to the gas chambers, some nods to the liberation of black slaves, wholesale cline everything and anything to give crédibilté, and the futuristic building of the future crumbling because we cut the power?!
there are 10 or 15 years, the hero of this kind of turnip were arnold schwarzouilléguerre or rambo sylvester.
