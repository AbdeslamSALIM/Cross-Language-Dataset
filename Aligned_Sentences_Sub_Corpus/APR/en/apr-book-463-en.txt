i agree with others who said that "beatrice" is not my favorite of the author (which is good among my favorites).
but when i read the headlines is a story that recurs most often in memory.
the funny thing is that it predicts instability as a result of lack of female births, in that what we see now seems rather the result of pressure of births.
