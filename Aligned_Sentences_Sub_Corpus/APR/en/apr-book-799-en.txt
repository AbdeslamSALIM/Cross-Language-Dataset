intrigues (now i believe in love and not final:)) then the characters are attached to them quickly.
how to write the author makes the series more attractive and there is still none the wiser!
feel not to buy this book, there will be good fights, intrigues, murders, assassination and ultimately in 9 volumes (i have not even started on 10, i just to buy:)) there are so many things that happen ...
ps: this comment concerns the whole series, as i note the richness of thrones.
