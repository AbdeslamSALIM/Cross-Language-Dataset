there really is such a book failed: 2 stories with no real link, a total lack of consistency, style dish, a permanent boredom, no end ...
however, the idea is appealing, following the exodus of french in 40 and describe the cheap shots at all levels.
but the novel seems to have been botched, the book is the most tasteless i've read since "the sweetest dream" by doris lessing.
