it is the story of a young american woman who is raped during her childhood.
likely to grow too fast, he only left the piano to escape from this cruel world.
a few months later, the girl released her first album and is a triumph.
the public falls under the spell of her voice and the piano that remind him rickie lee jones (shadowboxer, the chid is gone, criminal).
somehow, he feels responsible for what happened to him.
guilty mostly find beauty in the sadness of his eyes.
the emotion is so strong (never is a promise, sullen girl "and" slow like honey) he wants to cry.
and for this reason that tidal is great.
