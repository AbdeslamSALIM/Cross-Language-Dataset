if his previous novels suffered from a rather turgid writing, they received at least interesting plots and engaging characters.
so what cruel disappointment that this book - a shipwreck.
rather than stay in his world, trying descosse the plunge with a novel business squinting one eye on the other grang√© on dan brown and picks up beautifully.
i gave up after 150 pages as it is inconsistent.
hopefully we will find the decosse of these previous books in the next!
