celine dion album opens with the beautiful successful slow "the reason" which proves once again that the diva has vocal cords in perfect condition!
would follow a lot of good songs like "treat her like a lady" or the magnificent "tell him" with the talented performer barbra streisand.
despite vocal qualities more than obvious, celine dion slight lack of depth on this cd and emotion seem rather "prefabricated." in addition, the singer is neither author nor composer, or even producing her albums ...
it merely push chansonette still in power, always accurately, always in style, but very rarely in sensitivity.
