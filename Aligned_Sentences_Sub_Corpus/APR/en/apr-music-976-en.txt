the old stones is back ....
bon missing exile on main st, which should be out by the end of "year.
the remaster is excellent and does not regret the old records (though dusty!), guitars slapping, bass &amp; drums are very present and the sax, the ensemble gives a second life to all these tracks / tubes that pass throughout these albums.
break out the money, worth the purchase of the box or unit ...
