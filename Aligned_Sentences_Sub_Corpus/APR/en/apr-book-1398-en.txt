i'm bored throughout these three hundred pages, not seeing no end.
nothing interested me: or the disappointments of myriam and his restaurant or his grim past or his future gentillet short, while i weighed.
and on reflection, i realized why: there is no sensuality in these pages.
although the author is telling revenue - or rather dishes - like so many beads, but not the pleasure of taste is there.
myriam kitchen stuff she wants to fill their stomachs to help fill the hearts and fill its empty inside.
