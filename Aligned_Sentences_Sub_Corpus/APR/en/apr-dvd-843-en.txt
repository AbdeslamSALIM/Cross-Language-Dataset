king kong, the original shoedsack was magical.
the remake of guillermin lost the magic but earned an emotion.
i awaited the release of jackson as a final version, bringing magic and emotion.
alas, this is not the case.
the achievement may well be impressive, the actors are nonetheless poorly (it is far from the pianist adrien brody) and too many scenes proved altogether unsuccessful.
you can see it race worthy of a diplodocus tex avery, without an ounce of realism, and that never ends?
all these sequences filling unnecessary and ridiculous take this remake down, even though he has great qualities.
for indeed, this version offers a more realistic gorilla and human than ever, but still some who type sequences in the mile, as the rebuilding of new york for 30 years, capture of kong island where we see strength in weakness mutate (moment of intense emotion), trance natives (even if they lack authenticity), but the reunion of the beauty and the beast on a frozen lake, inexplicably avoiding the pitfall of ridicule for a moment of emotional intimacy.
but unfortunately it does not save this king kong who errs on the side of exaggeration and lack of inspiration
