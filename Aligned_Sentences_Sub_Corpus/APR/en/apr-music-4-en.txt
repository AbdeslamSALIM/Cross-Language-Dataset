the recordings of maria callas is a real world treasure.
a reference that any "amateur" must have.
the artist knew modulate his voice to the needs of the work she sang.
everything seems so simple in its approach so that we know that great art is so difficult to achieve.
she knew not disappear completely but get involved to allow the music to live fully.
some criticize this edition to present too many cds in timing short, it could be tightened to a smaller number.
instead i appreciate the option of emi to publish cds with the same content as the initial release.
and what a bargain!
