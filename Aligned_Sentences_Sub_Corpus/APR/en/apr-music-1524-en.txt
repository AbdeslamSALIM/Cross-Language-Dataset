it is true that a live sound is relatively clean and that means virtually no public during the songs (but it is also the case for vhs and dvd's live band).
apart from that, there is not much wrong with this live.
if "the beautiful people" is a bit disappointing compared to what one might expect, the versions of "get your gunn" and especially "lunchbox" take their full scale concert.
it was also entitled to a final apocalytpique for "sweet dreams" and "irresponsible hate anthem" while "the last day on earth" takes a new dimension in sound.
