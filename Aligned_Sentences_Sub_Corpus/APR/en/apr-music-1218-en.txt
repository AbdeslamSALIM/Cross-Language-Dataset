in the flow of underground and experimental productions, we should not ignore this album in every way beautiful.
inventiveness, wealth and daring compositions, melodies tormented, structured, improvised, but always surprising.
hatfield and the north (and sympathetic northettes vote crystalline) gave two albums of high quality and the sound of which, although amended following the 70's has not aged!
from the pop-jazz canterbury but even more: the hatfield ...
style sometimes imitated, never equaled (national health and gilgamesh are perhaps those who are closest to this pure musical genius).
same comment for the band's first album (with an intrusion by robert wyatt).
nothing to throw into this (too) short discography enchanting.
a great big group that continues to thrill me thirty years later!
