far too commercial album of english (not even talking about a new day has come and the color of my love), celine offers us the most beautiful opus from his repertoire.
the quality of the album is up to the album of them in studio and live sound adds more intensity.
celine excels in the art of vocal prowess never do too much in this live while shade. "river deep montain high" is as anthology presenting his orchestra at the end of "the ballet" would pale any singer.
if you buy one album of celine dion buy that and do not venture into the language of shakespeare!
