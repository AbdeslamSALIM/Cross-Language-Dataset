far from leaving the viewer free to decide for himself, a voice, without name or title, but seen as the voice of truth, draws conclusions that whispers tandem prieur-mordillat: those who claimed jesus l 'have betrayed the early centuries of christianity, for their "collaboration with the powers that be" by the "suicidal folly" of their martyrs, by their virulent anti-semitism, etc.. "jesus announced the kingdom, and that the church has come" taken out of context, that little phrase loisy, taken as a leitmotif, is deliberately diverted from its meaning.
one discovers a veritable war machine against christianity, but cunningly hidden by the beautiful images and condoned (unwittingly?) by the guests themselves, whose word is totally bomb.
