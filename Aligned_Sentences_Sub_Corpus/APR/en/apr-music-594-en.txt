madonna fan since childhood there i could not be more disappointed and i'm listening and re-listening for weeks now to no avail, is an album sloppy and bad.
madonna should never have to position themselves in the role of follower is when it innovates it excels, there follows the move and is therefore lagging behind because all the sounds present on this album are worn and no title has a carure tubesque my eyes glance quickly in 2010 and the new album lol hoping that it is innovative
