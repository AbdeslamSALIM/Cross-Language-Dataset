the images are beautiful and the sound quality excellent.
explosions, machine-gun fire and cries, in short, a breathtaking spectacle noisy.
but is it enough for a film: the acting is totalmeent stereotyped actress pricipale (wife) less attractive than before and not very funny.
the scenario is not very detailed, a classic and simple commercial .
the son discovered the statues over two millennia in china, the villains not want to wake the handsome chef who threatens world security.
and our heroic guguce with his look of fried whiting will save this world.
déjà vu, no?
short i'm pretty bored and i got a little tired it is rarely possible to find a movie with special effects mixed with a minimum of brainpower.
