miyazaki fan, like many, i do not share the opinion of everyone on this film.
indeed, it is wonderful, very well done, etc etc ...
the end shocked me.
i admit that the end has left a bitter taste on the entire film.
it remains to be seen, because as always plenty of humor mixed with great talent and the magic of morality ...
