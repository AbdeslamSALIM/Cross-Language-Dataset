i bought the trilogy in one book.
given the comments given here i thought to be the shelter ...
oh, but i think we can say that i read, with some forty books read per year. (i command souvant 5 or 6 at a time on amazon). ...
a little girl, no problem i tell you.
it's too childish, ca fait history for children (under 10 years) told by an adult.
the emphasis is of course something "corny", the immature side of this hero.
we always use the same kind of descriptions without interest.
reminds me of narnia less well.
i read several volumes of the latter in english to improve my level and i still enjoyed the story.
there must be real love stories for children is to be one to enjoy reading.
i think that this is the best children's books that could be found.
far from it.
