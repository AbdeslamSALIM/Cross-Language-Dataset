i just watch the colorized version of "fanfan la tulipe".
the colors accentuate the images d'epinal, with costumes military uniforms court of louis xv.
gerard philippe fanfan camp with panache and a zest for life overflowing.
marcel herrand is louis sv legends, with his arrogance, his "apparent impartiality".
gina lollobrigida is lovely and has a screen presence.
genevi√®ve page is an actress of class that derives much of its pin-jer.
a movie review for the simple pleasure of a good story and dream that "good always triumph ends"!
