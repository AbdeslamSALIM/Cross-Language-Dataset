of course there are big strings in terms of emotion and some effects are a little "manufactured".
also the sound was quite rises above the average of french productions year of its release.
to return to this album, same observation as the previous one: failure.
text level cm2, music on the edge of ridiculous production "with the pc of a friend ..." we will retain the goldmanesque 4 mots sur un piano, because it's the only time we find the unique voice of this singer who is searching.
