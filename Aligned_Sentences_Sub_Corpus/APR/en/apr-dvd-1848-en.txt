fourth film of elvis 1958 black and white, directed by michael curtis (casablanca with bogart).
the scenario is very close to those of films of "juvenile delinquents" of the late 50s in france c etait jackets noirs.
elvis plays well and many scenes are outside the new orleans.
its partners are comedians confirmes walter matthau, carolyn jones, vic morrow.
but what remains most in this movie are the songs.
a classic trouble of leiber and stoller with j hallyday will the fighting one of the highlights of his show al olympia in 1962, not to mention king creole, dixieland rock, crawfish, opening song of the film with some bearing hips though sympathetic).
i saw this movie for the first time in cinema in 1964 and he made me such an effect that i've dropped the beatles that i had seen al olympia in february of that year s because they sang the rock n they had not talented dancer of elvis or his bad boy look.
a film was indispensable every lover of rock.
