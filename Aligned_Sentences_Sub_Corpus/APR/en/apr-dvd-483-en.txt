if it was feared the worst to see a production deal with the american kung-fu, with jet li and jackie chan headlining, we must recognize that the surprise is even better.
it is still surrounded by yuen woo-ping in martial arts choreographer (which is just a reference) and peter pau photography (which is also a leader in his field).
so, there is fighting cable and air very successful and often very dramatic, and we sailed in beautiful scenery.
note also a very beautiful music by david buckley.
finally, jackie chan and jet li are clearly in great shape in this film and give the best of themselves for fighting still very entertaining.
each has 2 roles in the film.
a lot of adventure and humor to a mainstream film to recommend.
