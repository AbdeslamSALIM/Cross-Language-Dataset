this album closing the trilogy begun by the previous album "wax" and "dancetaria" ...
indochina we surprised by an album both haunting and full of nrj ....
nicola sirkis take us in a strange mingling of the themes of religion, sex and love ...
away from all stereotypes c reality naked or sublimated by the soul of an artist! ...
not to mention stealthy winks to great bands like nin, marilyn manson or cure !!!!! ....
a real treat for lovers of good music!!
in short an album full of strength to get emergency!!
