i do not understand ...
fan of the first hour of glassjaw, i was captivated by the project head automatica at the exit of decadence, an album-rock groove very playful and searched.
but here, with this second album, we are faced with a very low level of originality!
it would make a very good film soundtrack to the weak american pie ...
only the third runway nice enough worth to be listened to, and yet ...
it's a bit silly and we get tired pretty quickly ...
it pains me to say, but: this second opus is a real disappointment!
