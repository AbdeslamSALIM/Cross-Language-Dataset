'traffic' is a film which accounted for an oscar in 2001.
the first is the realization of steven soderbergh: perfect!
it uses 3 colors to depict 3 stories revolving around the issue of drugs.
these stories originally distinct eventually intersect, just as in the splendid 'exotica' by atom egoyan, and the colors end up mixing.
the second reason i believe it is the quality of the interpretation of certain players.
except for a catherine zeta-jones very pale and soulless, the others are perfect.
i will remember most benicio del toro, extraordinary, and michael douglas, always fair.
some may criticize the film's slow pace and lack of emotion.
