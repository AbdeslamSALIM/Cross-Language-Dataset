confusing at first listen, the music is unusual.
but what's that good!
a kind of trip hop with a sound of classical music by the use of strings and horns.
a song in an acute neolanguage is another unique feature of this disc.
an incredible sweetness emanates from this album and sometimes gives way to mounted impressive instrumental power.
svefn-g-englar gives the same sensations that aquatic echoes of pink floyd (even underwater noise for that matter).
the strings are of incredible magnificence of the rock in staralfur.
and what about the piano in viorar vel til loftarasa!
the trip hop influence is undeniable in flugufrelsarinn which approaches a morcheeba moment by his side air and melodic.
the first peak is very symphonic olsen olsen.
this album is very dangerous and should be handled with caution because it can be very emotionally destabilizing.
