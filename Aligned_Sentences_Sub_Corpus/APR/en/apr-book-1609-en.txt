before tackling this book i wondered what could be the interest of putting a touch of fantasy in a historical novel.
after reading, i still have no answer, i am still looking.
thwarted love, sacrifice, passion and reason of state, all the ingredients to thrill the female base.
and yes, this is a book written by a woman and women.
the story rose water is tinged with history to make some serious, anyway.
many photographs, even wheelbarrows, a lot of good feelings as the misadventures timed and calibrated for different main characters are no surprises, we swim in the deja vu.
no idea, it adds nothing to the plot, but one chouia ridiculous.
