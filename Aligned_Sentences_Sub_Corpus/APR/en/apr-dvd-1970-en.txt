so happy to finally acquire the first episodes of sanctuary on dvd i was extremely disappointed.
yet the same scenes were well spent on tv!
the sound is not good, either.
i much preferred a japanese version with subtitles.
i do not understand that we not take advantage of the dvd to offer a more original version of the french version.
