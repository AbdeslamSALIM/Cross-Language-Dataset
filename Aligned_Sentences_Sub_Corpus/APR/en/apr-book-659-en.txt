i read a lot, and this is the book that i had the most difficulty in completing the reading.
watching an upheaval, finally, or the appearance of a character somewhat expanded ...
but not even the end disappointed me.
while the plot is tied kindly, and it follows nicely the actors in their developments, either in globalia or non-zones.
but everything is so predictable, and it is really lacking in this ambitious novel of humanity.
not simplistic, but too pink.
the gentle rebel, the cold technocrats, the military rigid and shady mafia, it has already seen a hundred thousand, including the american productions.
