as a recent interview with david coverdale suggests, this opus is nothing exciting - and it is little to say.
if the artist himself was sober, at least vis-Ã -vis its hard to come there were visibly (audibly?) reason.
the compounds devoid of its interest in a few planes and intros well-chosen (as the title track), the sound of the guitar is heavy and excessive fat covering almost all the rest, the prod was all drowned in reverb; coverdale wrote things more sentimental and insignificant it is at the crossroads of several generations, but the mayonnaise and "ageism" coverdale do not!
is simply insipid and this lack of simplicity and spontaneity.
even fans of 1987 (which i am not) could unfortunately not find it.
