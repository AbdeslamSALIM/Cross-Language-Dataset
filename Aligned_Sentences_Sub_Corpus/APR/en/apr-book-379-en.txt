i waited impatiently for the new book by nicolas rey memory for short and thirteen minutes left me a deep impression.
rey describes with wonder adolescence and thirties disenchanted.
the author has the gift of retrancrire life miserable and full of promises sometimes in formulas adorable and relevant.
vivement le prochain!
