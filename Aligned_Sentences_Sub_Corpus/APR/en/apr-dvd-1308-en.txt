here's a flim i am not tired and that leaves me smug whenever i see it as positive energy emerges.
the subject of the film, what is it really?
the house is central, this beautiful building in which all our people will find themselves on the death of the grandmother.
there is more then to follow them in a sort of invigorating whirlpool.
the actors are all perfect, federated around michel piccoli.
perhaps a bit of happiness that we communicate, supported by the joyous violin st√©phane grappelli!
you want to enter with them into the dance, singing loudly "the daughter of the bedouin ..." !
