released in 1955, after peter pan and before sleeping beauty, beauty and the tramp (lady and the tramp) is a pure delight.
the subject seems modest and ambitious in terms of adaptations of classic fairy tales and children's books that favored the studio at that time but it may be that humility and simplicity that make the price.
like any classic childhood movie known to be both scary (the subject is basically the abandonment of children by parents, the ultimate fear) and reassuring (belle finds a substitute family and even the love).
in short, an essential purchase for children and adults.
