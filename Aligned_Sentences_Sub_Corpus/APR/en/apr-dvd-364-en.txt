if one sets aside the script and the love-type dawson, this film is really not that bad.
it is far more than we hear about it ...
but what makes a good action movie is that the fights are intelligent, they are not as sequences of baf-baf, there is originality in the clashes, teleportation is really the way to changing world and types of combat (like in equilibrium).
the characters are all pretty good (except the girlfriend of the hero, but that's normal is the nice girl stereotype).
we retain the crew of heroes writer is not depressing either, saying it is more of a context to chase a real scenario.
finally, a film that goes for the pace, efficiency, and the pure pleasure it brings.
