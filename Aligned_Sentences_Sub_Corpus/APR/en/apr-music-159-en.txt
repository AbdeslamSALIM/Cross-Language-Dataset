arrival of adrian smith (a virtuoso), and focus more rock'n'roll.
this album is one of my favorites.
too bad few tracks are played live compared to the first album.
maiden is one of the few groups to meet his fans every hour.
the prodigal son song is amazing, they are pumped from first to last as not up to speed.
