i saw this movie at the cinema when it was released.
i struggled to stay until the end, i was bored after an hour.
i watched it again 2 days ago on tv: i made 2 hours this time before you get bored and turn off the post.
yet this movie has (very) good assets: stunning visuals, excellent actors (nick nolte, elias koteas and sean penn stand out), a very good music, who knows how to be discreet when necessary.
unfortunately this is far too long.
the proof that war is cruel does not require as much monologue, shooting, personal situations.
the director wants us to follow the thoughts of too many different characters, which lengthens the film and affects the fluidity of history.
we may regret in particular that the film does not end with the capture of the village in melee combat and confrontation with the japanese survivors.
this is the climax of the film, and unfortunately we resumed again for another hour, which adds nothing.
