what to say about this album?
especially it should not stop the fact that it includes only titles that have already been heard on stage for several months: some arrangements make them unrecognizable, and that's saying something.
marie has matured, both in word and in the melody or vocal technique.
it is far from gentle ballads now the first album.
life, sometimes beautiful, sometimes cruel, deaf to every word.
here we regret the irritating singer, is remembered verdun, here it refers to an empty love, there is paid glowing tribute to a loved one, then finally the dreams become life ...
what always surprises at marie cherrier, c is the maturity of texts and cultural references that liven the interpretation and command respect.
it found a sensitivity transcended by words.
so of course we found the album a little short: 10 titles, less than 40 minutes ...
we would have liked a few more songs to better understand this multifaceted universe, from the laughing emotion on his way to resentment subsided!
arrangements marie cherrier reveal a more mature, more confident, not hesitating to speak some words, instead of singing.
we may find some surprising biases, such as the presence of keyboards that seem to overlap with other instruments in a somewhat chaotic (on "black coffee" or "well, what").
we may also find the mix of "legs wolf" rather abstruse.
nevertheless, the arrangements, from jazz to pop-rock, give real momentum to the album, while losing the benchmarks for each title.
perhaps what we could blame for this album: to vary the style, it's as if marie cherrier had not yet found his world.
but we do not expect less of the fair, which has demonstrated since the beginning of her career she did not like the well-paved roads that stick to feathers and free in his creative process, she wanted to offer spontaneous public image of itself ...
