looking at your site, the works of this writer, i stopped on the book title by laurence semonin "proust's madeleine.
the reading, commentary, back cover, left me perplexed.
i'd like to read this book that had to do with my desire that the title ?.....
upon receipt of the shipment, i started right away reading.
i understand why the title given by the author.
i was caught by the tale of memory of laurence, and let myself be carried away by the memories recounted.
this memory is full of poetry, original and surprising.
i loved this title, then i read "in search of lost time".
now i think that "proust's madeleine" laurence semonin is for me "time regained", that of memory, that of madeleines.
