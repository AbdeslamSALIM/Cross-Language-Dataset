undoubtedly, this album is historic.
for the rest, let me laugh!
the dominance of mccartney on the album?
propaganda fueled by lennon himself (read his interviews you'll see)!
a title overwrites the remainder is of course "a day in the life".
for me it's the white album / white album and abbey road that i listen more and more often!
