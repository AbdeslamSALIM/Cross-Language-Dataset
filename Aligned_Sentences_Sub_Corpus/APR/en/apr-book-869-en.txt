i had to criticize my famous namesake.
prompted by the similarity of our names, i bought without prejudice his 1st book ...
review: besides the fact that this book is nothing but a copy of a parody book barjavel, mixed with the movie "ghost" came out long before the book past the shaker and shaken, it is much more poorly written in a style school, lifeless, uninspired.
marc levy produces bestselling books, exhilarating to some, as are the perfumes of supermarkets: heady, flattering at first but quickly boring, too trivial, no character!
but, as some singers from a famous "academy", these products are made to be sold and popular ...
but they are to literature what macdonalds is to gourmet.
fat, sweet, but they quickly leave a stomach ache before the interstellar void.
i sometimes feel better write that my namesake ...
