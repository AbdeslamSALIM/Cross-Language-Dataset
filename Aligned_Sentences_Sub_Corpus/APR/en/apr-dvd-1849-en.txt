this film has all the 50's sci-fi standards except the flame thrower.
we start off with a narrative that shows an atomic testing taking place in the frozen north.
two people go out to take readings after the test.
one does not come back and the other is delusional, talking of a monster.
naturally he needs curing and is almost well with a female paleontologist starts to believe him and offers to let him eat her sandwiches and look at mug shots of mobsters past.
can be convinced the authorities before it is too late?
