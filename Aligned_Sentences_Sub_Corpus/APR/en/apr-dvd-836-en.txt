he is deaf and dumb, violent and ruthless.
let yourself be carried away by the intense atmosphere which prevails hatred, suffering but also tenderness and love.
the acting is sensational and the scenes breathtaking.
this film is spectacular and the dvd transcribed perfectly ...
note however it is not recommended for sensitive souls.
