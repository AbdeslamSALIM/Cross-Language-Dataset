the ideas of friedrich nietzsche strongly influence the thoughts of today.
as classical philologists, poet, philosopher and moralist its enormous importance for our culture is there, every moment of the day. "thus spoke zarathustra" is his magnus opum, his most important work.
this masterpiece is a brilliant collection of maxims and aphorisms without mental models, but full of wisdom, "savoir vivre" live!
brilliant work, out of competition, clearly legible and that will affect us for a very, very long time.
