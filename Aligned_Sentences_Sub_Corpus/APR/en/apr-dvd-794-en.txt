the man from laramie!
simply my favorite movie of anthony mann, a true film about me bedside.
a western perfectly mastered and wisdom unrivaled.
this film takes place on a slow pace and intelligence of the narrative mann bursts of violence with a suddenness ahurrissante certainly great moments in film (the scene of salt marshes, brawl in the city brought by a high power traveling, the settlement of accounts in the valley between dave and lockhart ...).
but this violence is not the characters or the psychology of the characters but more to the sequence of situations and the interference of the characters is what gives the film the tragic dimension.
among the quintet magic mann-stewart westerns, this film is the only one to be filmed in cinemascope.
it is perfectly sales person, crushing to infinity certain perspectives (see the funeral scene ...), landscapes are beautifully used in any case they do allow a setting to a story counts.
here, the geography of places to direct action on the account.
i also see a legacy of his term "film noir" with plans cons-diving and ambiguity throughout the film, namely that we does not really discern who is the traitor (basically the most wicked film), the vision of the viewer changes at this level all throughout the story (the murder of the innocent dave as he seems to be the bastard any designated vic becomes the abbattre man).
