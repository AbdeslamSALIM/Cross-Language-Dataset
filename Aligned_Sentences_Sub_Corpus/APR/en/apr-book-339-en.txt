if i put this note is to moderate the overall rating given to this book, which may mislead some potential readers.
i said that i did not read the newspaper 1941-1943.
personally, i only had a few moments of reading pleasure (it is not difficult to read, but i'm very bored) browsing this work.
i obviously can not put myself in the shoes of someone who lived through these events, then and i do not know what "defense system" would have approved.
some ideas are very interesting, but what irritated me the most is having had the impression sometimes qu'etty hillesum was a sort of illuminated whose courage and love of life, unfortunately, based on a kind of mysticism, a little blurry.
the closer you get to the end, the more she talks about god.
obviously this book has qualities and deserves more than this brief comment.
but my opinion is still that this is not a book indispensable.
