kafka this book tells a strange story that emanates from the supernatural, but that seems a real blow because the author manages to get under the skin even gregory, a human transformed into a kind of mournful beetle, which is both all harmless innocent.
a pound of pure black humor to reflect on the themes of sacrifice, guilt, family, scrutiny and assertiveness.
a reading for lovers of kafka.
