a book to go quickly, a scientific level near the sixth with shortcuts to a maddening nonsense.
this book insults without argument and exposes without explanation.
how one line happens to sweep the farming and three lines, heating with wood.
it is simplistic and mostly totally ideological.
unresolved, is worthy of a presentation college.
