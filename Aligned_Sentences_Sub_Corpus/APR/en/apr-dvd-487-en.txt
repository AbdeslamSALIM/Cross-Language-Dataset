totally agree that it is wrong to impose the subtitles.
for my part, i no longer buy the bluray tf1 and studio canal and i advise all bilingual to do so.
so why enrich publishers who do not respect the freedom that can provide a dvd or bluray? ...
in any case, those who agree should also push for an end to this practice, considering the price of bluray in general ...
