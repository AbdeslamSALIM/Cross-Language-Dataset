with this album the band has really gained in popularity.
this disc was released in 1985 contains of course the tube must "love like blood"!
besides this piece, the suite is totally excellent.
killing joke tackles the fans of rock, or depeche mode the cure.
this new trend will be confirmed on the next album "brighter than a thousantd suns.
otherwise, no other big hits on the "night time" the whole is homogeneous and listen at once.
with the cd format is becoming more demanding and unfortunately there are no bonus tracks. 40 minutes of music, but a very good time to go.
