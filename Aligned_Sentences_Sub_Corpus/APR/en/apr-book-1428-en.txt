i tested this system there is this 4 years and this time i was the happy, i motivated with other dukaniens booked on a forum, i was testing many recipes for making proteins as appetizing as possible, j 'were happy to eat mackerel in the morning even if it disgusts me now and yet the euphoria of the moment because we believe it.
i lost almost ten pounds, but the euphoria soon passed and the return to a normal diet, we always end up jumping on forbidden and nothing prevents the recovery of lost pounds.
so before those who believe make the plan because weight loss is within the reach of everyone, start by listening to those who have tried to stabilize it, is the focal point of dieting.
so in conclusion you away from this scheme dangerous and unbalanced.
