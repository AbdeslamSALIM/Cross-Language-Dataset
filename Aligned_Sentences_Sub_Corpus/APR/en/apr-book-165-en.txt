having devoured the first volume in praying that the second is also, if not better, here i am diving in the second volume.
the story continues, painfully, it dragged on the display that makes the author's learn eventually no longer be deceived and we catch ourselves looking forward to the outcome, we hope after such a great pad.
and yet, if you love good books, you can miss without remorse!
