saga exhilarating, the first opus focuses on the comparison of 2 modes of thoughts and minds of two opposites: those of neanderthals, anchored in memory of their ancestors, incapable of renewal, with those of cro-magnons in perpetual search of invention and re-creation.
moreover, the exceptional destiny of a courageous woman and a healer inspired.
very well documented historically and botany as well as the ecological and climate of what could be the paleolithic europe.
through the 5 volumes (which kept me in suspense), it will ignore the scenes of coitus exotic to the first, then desperately repetitive thereafter and on the many contradictions undermining the psychological construction of the central character, an exceptional woman "released" before the time and yet remained subject unconditionally to the desire of his male.
over the 5 volumes, the reader witnesses among others the invention of pottery, the thrusters, the sewing needle and above all of the domestication of the horse.
despite the inconsistencies and blunders, the character is really endearing and fans can only hope the arrival of the 6th opus (being written and it seems so far to be translated)!
