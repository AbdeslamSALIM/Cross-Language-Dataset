i have done by this outstanding author to which i already read 3 novels exciting.
this is often the same type of plot, a character for whom things are going pretty well, even a slight increase and then suddenly falling quite dramatically, when he hit bottom, we are desperate and clinging to the book point no longer sleep to read .....
and then a primer, it goes back, we feel he can cope, it begins to blow, to breathe but still can not release the book until the end.
