i am obliged to return this product my however sophisticated reader refuses to read: "wrong disc" he said!
my car radio does not know either!
i have the impression that the product protected by an anti-copy can not be played on all devices!
i would have requested an exchange but i am afraid that the result is the same, i will still not change the stereo, then i demand a refund ...
