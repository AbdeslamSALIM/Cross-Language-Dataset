but he was waiting for this fourth installment!
too young to have enjoyed the trilogy in film, frankly, i was enthusiastically announced the release of this opus.
it is clear that once the end credits running through, one wonders what has been passing in the minds of scriptwriters.
if the first hour is in the pure tradition "indianajonesque" fighting with the jubilant whip and jokes galore, the sequence is much less successful, the fault scenario using runaway becomes totally and frankly ridiculous when the action lies in the jungle.
all this to lead to an end with little grotesque extraterrestrial mayhem and other flying saucer in a deluge of digital effects missed.
the film does not mean devoid of qualities, far from it.
spielberg is a great director and this is reflected on the screen by planes searched a dynamic assembly and a general aesthetic frankly sublime.
side casting is almost flawless with harrison ford surprising that nothing seems to have lost his energy, shia lebeouf, which proves (finally) that he can run and talk at the same time and a cate blanchett in impec nasty russian rrrroule systematically "r".
the supporting roles are anecdotal with john hurt really bad to interpret the madness and return far less powerful than expected because of karen allen's role is limited to the representation.
all the ingredients were there to rob the fans lack in power but too ogle the side of science fiction, indiana jones finally s'autoparodier.
