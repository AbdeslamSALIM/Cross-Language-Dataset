i loved, and this book is now out of my favorite books.
it is true that we come to understand all the ins and aboutissments travel in time to attend and enjoy the story, but it's very well explained.
claire and henry are two very lovable characters, and they are super cute.
moving one surprise and it's great!
read absolumenent, you must not missed!
