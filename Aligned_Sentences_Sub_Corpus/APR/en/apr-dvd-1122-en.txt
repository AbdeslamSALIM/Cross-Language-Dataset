having devoured the novel, i was eager to see the implementation on the big screen.
cassel is not credible and does not correspond to any character in the novel grange.
the ending is sloppy and incomprehensible.
i wondered how the audience who had not read the novel have been able to understand anything.
the opening theme is the only moment of emotion, beautiful and surprising.
a little light for a big budget film!!
