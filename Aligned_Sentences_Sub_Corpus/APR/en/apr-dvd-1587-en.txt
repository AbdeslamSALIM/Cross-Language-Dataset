excellent british series in 8 episodes of 50 minutes.
the series was not renewed because of hearing, sometimes i have trouble understanding people!
amy is enrolled in the ghost squad, a unit to infiltrate the police in order to expose police ripoux .
if we add the performance of elaine cassidy in the role of amy, we get a gem not to be missed.
