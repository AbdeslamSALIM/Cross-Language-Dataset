i was extremely disappointed to discover that reading this book is the translation (which i recognize, however, be of excellent quality) of original content exceeded.
the reference for this translation is indeed the first edition of "the data warehouse toolkit lyfecycle" published in 1998 by john wiley &amp; sons, inc..
under the isbn 0471255475.
the original structure has undergone a major overhaul in its second edition in 2008: the reader of this book "lost" so 10 years (an eternity in this business) experience, technical developments and constructive criticism of users taken into account in the publication of "the data warehouse lifecycle toolkit, 2nd edition." by john wiley &amp; sons, inc..
under isbn number 9780470149775.
needless to say, this second edition i am everywhere since its release.
if, like me, you have a pressing need for the french terminology to meet a french customer, you will have little choice other than you get this book knowing that you will at most french-english dictionary project dw / bi.
if by cons there is no emergency and you are looking for the real reference book that will accompany you during your project dw / bi, good advice: wait for a translation of the second edition!
