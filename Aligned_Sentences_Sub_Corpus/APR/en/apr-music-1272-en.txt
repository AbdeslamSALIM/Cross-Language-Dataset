but come on, if we take the time to listen to this album!
how many times the new house we do not bassinn√©e with these guitars, this pop false cool, these low predictable.
and "daft punk return" (proof that no one has ever recovered from the feat homework).
stop this reference to daft punk, it does not mean the same thing.
we would want to bow before the force of an album named justice, part of a group called justice.
in the current atmosphere, nothing better.
justice will be remembered for clubbers.
for me, for cons, it will quun album more in the sound wave of a kind that in addition to guitars, saturated the shelves of record stores.
