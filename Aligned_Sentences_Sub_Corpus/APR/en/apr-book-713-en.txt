i like books by cathy kelly although it is difficult to get hold of it.
his stories are always full of charm in the heart of ireland with the main characters of women.
women of all ages and all conditions of all history.
this book speaks of the same family, 3 sisters and their mother, different lives, different characters, but all tend to the same creed, be happy.
and it is starting on the path of their stories, we forget our own to share their joys and sorrows.
a moment in the lives of others, and reading this book has done its job: evasion.
