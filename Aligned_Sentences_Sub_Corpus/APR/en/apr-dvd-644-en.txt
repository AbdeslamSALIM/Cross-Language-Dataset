to those who await a new edition with the master key, i announce that this is unfortunately just a repackaging of the first edition tf1 video published in may 2000.
the master is identical.
worse, the average bit rate has decreased and supplements have simply disappeared.
finally, when you put the disk in the drive, the film starts immediately and there is not even a menu.
we are back in the days of vhs.
that said, we sold it 6 euros ...
