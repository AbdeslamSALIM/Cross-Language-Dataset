very good performance for these friends dj shadow, originating in northern california.
a2g is a pearl of hip-hop, their melodies moog keyboards, bass and guitars amplified sound terribly funky.
the rhythms are catchy and super singer's flow is unstoppable. "alphabet aerobics" and "deception" are really good songs that do not leave our insensitive ears.
in short, this album is really excellent and innovative in the genre.
