usually, i always try to find at least some qualities of a film.
the film, a claim and a ridiculous rarely seen, throws the viewer's head of concepts that coppola seems to have dug in eliade without understanding anything so far.
theme of the double reincarnation through the origin of language, everything is mixed, scratched, never in detail.
moreover, it played badly, badly filmed, sinister end to end.
this film is without beginning or end at least has the merit to prove without dispute that a major production can bludgeon the viewer boredom heavier than will ever more abstruse film arthouse.
no, at this point of foutage of mouth, i can only recommend to my potential readers not to waste a night like i did watching this film to forget emergency.
