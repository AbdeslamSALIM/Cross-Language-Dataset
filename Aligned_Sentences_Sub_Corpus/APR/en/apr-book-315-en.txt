the story is flat and the characters ultimately hollow.
irving displays even cultural gaps (or writing too fast and therefore not documented ?...): the chapter held in japan demonstrates his total ignorance of the country's rising sun: this contrasts cruelly with detailed descriptions of certain areas the united states.
a book for fans of john irving.
