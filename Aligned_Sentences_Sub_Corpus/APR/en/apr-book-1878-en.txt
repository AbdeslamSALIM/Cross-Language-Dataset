for nearly 4 years that i study magic, i am interested in the high magic, wicca and the natural magic.
well no book struck me as superficial as that.
not only the "rituals" are punctuated by errors, but also can convey misconceptions about the practice of magic.
so my only advice to the novice eager to discover the magic: the books of franz bardon are by far the best.
word of witch ^ _ ^!
