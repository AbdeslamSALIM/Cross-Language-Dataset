the characters are endearing, certainly ...
but not very interesting anyway.
it is filmed in order to bring us into the intimacy of the characters, upwind faces.
but the camera has the shakes, and i had nausea on several occasions.
this makes the film somewhat enjoyable!
as for the story, ultimately, not very exciting: the teacher who takes drugs and dark in forfeiture, before the eyes of a young girl who eventually became his dealer and provide depth in dope. ..
their relationship seems nice, but they grant each other one to the other (positive of course)?
short, at the end of the film, i really feel a mess and also have wasted my time.
