the content is very good, very complete.
for the price paid is a good buy.
of course there is the format.
you lose 15-20% left and far right.
plus a little upwards and downwards (least severe).
by cons, on the pc, it automatically runs in true 16:9 and we then realized all that is lost on television.
in short, as everyone will soon have a plasma screen, a little patience to enjoy this show soon hair that has not aged ...
final score: 1 star for the format and 5 stars for content.
