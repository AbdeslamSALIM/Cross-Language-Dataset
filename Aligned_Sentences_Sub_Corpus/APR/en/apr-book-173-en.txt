another book about the school, as told himself pennac.
and as i like pennac, i say let "them", it will be nice.
we will find the smell of glue, canned spinach canteen of transpiration in the locker room of sports.
the story has not even been in the center.
it has 2 components: the dunce and the teacher.
what is amusing nonetheless is that for once we speak the same person, dunce become a teacher.
anecdotes and memories enchainent fluidly, as if well known to the author.
we spend the dunce existential considerations in cases of conscientious teacher who tries not to drop the crabs he meets.
yes if you like pennac, and yes if you are or become a teacher.
