as much as i can say without shame that i liked the first, as it was a very big disappointment, not that i expected to see an excellent film but at least i thought i would spend a good time.
between the action scenes which are connected to the rhythm of the tolerable limit, the actresses who play on and also pose big stupid, i wonder if there are some things to do!
i who can not bear not to see a movie straight through, one, i saw him four times so it's hard to keep watching television!
to summarize, it is a kind of video clip 1 hour 40 where the story goes around the tenth plan.
you decide if you feel like wasting your time.
instead you turn to the first opus is much more fun.
