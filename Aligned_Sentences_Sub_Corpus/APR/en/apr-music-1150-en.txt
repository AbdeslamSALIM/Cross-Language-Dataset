hotel of the universe out of the ordinary, reality returns in leaps and bounds.
i was frankly disappointed by this album after a few plays.
it looks like the foal once much-busier-raphael is now very good in his stall, his album is not calm, it is boring, his words are not mature they are bland.
to avoid arousing controversy, i will not even his visit to the star academy, some forced by his record company to blow the dough ...
i hope the next album will look like something it, it will be hot or cold, not warm ...
for lovers of unviers hotel, go your way and go rather ogle side saez or mano solo, for others, a man (or woman) warned (e) is forearmed, this album by no cons worthless.
