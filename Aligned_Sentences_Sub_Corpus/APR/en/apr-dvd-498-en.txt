because his films are slower?
yes, his films are testimony to a bygone era, his films are classics.
it takes time to put the plot, to conduct its investigation and i confess that i'm back to 100% within.
history is not trivial and the film either.
let us not forget that a book is almost unlimited pages but a film must be restricted so there is really no comparison.
anyway, this is a good thriller, effective and without frills.
