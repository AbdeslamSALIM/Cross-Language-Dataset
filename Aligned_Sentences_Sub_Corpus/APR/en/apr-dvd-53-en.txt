then on the big screen.
i recently reviewed gran torino with a friend, we watched in french, and finally i'm not surprised that the scores are so low.
me, i'll buy the dvd when i saved money, but having seen the film three times convinced me that we stood there, perhaps the best film by clint eastwood (with mystic, million dollar and on the road).
the shot of the two grids confessional (the simulacrum of the first with the priest and the true with the young thao, behind the gates of the cave where walt spits the piece - a horrible crime committed in korea - that's a true genius idea ...).
not to mention the extraordinary and successful combination of two myths that the film solicits and change: that which draws men to the cycle of revenge (greek mythology) and the man god sacrificed for the salvation of mankind ( the christ figure of the final scene, after walt's efforts for a certain idea of transmission, justice, belief and faith).
