i enjoyed this book, but the narrative technique sometimes tortuous toni morrison makes reading sometimes confusing, we must overcome this difficulty and not get discouraged because it always ends not find the thread of the story because it really very well written.
there is something new in toni morrison, for those who do not know, to discover.
