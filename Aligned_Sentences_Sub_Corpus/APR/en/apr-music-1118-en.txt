this album is amazing.
a bit confusing for someone who's not familiar stivell but once we heard 10 or 20 times, it becomes a must.
in fact we never do get tired, and it is surprising sometimes a whistling air without knowing where it came from and when we remember, it inevitably comes to the symphony!
this album is the logical continuation of "renaissance of the celtic harp.
