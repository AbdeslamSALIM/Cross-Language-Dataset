i expected an autistic with superior intelligence would explain his feelings, his inner finally learn more about their differences, it breaks down, so to speak, it really explains what autism seen by an autistic.
finally, the author repeats dozens of times he was sick with "asperger syndrome".
i did felt that his "ego".
three lines enough to understand that he has the memory of several mammoths.
a star just to say i read it completely in the hope of finding a match to spark his pub.
