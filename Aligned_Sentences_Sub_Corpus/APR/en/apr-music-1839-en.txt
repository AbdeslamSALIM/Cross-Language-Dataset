i put a caveat to what follows: the gorgeous ballad "mother gaia", one of the most beautiful of stratovarius.
it illuminates the disk speed (and therefore boring) the possible.
you like fast songs with riff called assimilated in less than 2?
malmsteeniens full of tics and shrill voice?
this album is for you.
so i'm not saying that at 14 years, i am much amused to hear.
but good music cleenex such, it deserves only to fall into oblivion.
stratovarius is the group of 2 albums (3 at most: i love "dreamspace"), namely episode and visions.
conversely, if you do swear that the speed melodic, this album is for you.
