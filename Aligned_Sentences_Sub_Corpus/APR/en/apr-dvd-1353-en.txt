the adventures of duke with the sheriff rosco and boss hogg the stinking, i loved it when i was a teenager and i still remember those episodes with the same pleasure.
i love especially when the dog flash, big clumsy, rosco is a fool.
it's funny, it's relaxing, albeit still somewhat the same scenario: the duke pursues rosco and boss wants them shut.
fortunately that uncle jesse and daisy are there.
for all ages, for a moment of entertainment
