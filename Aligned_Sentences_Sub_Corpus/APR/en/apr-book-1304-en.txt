this book is fairly representative of philosophy as what 'humanity is the cancer of the earth'.
if we follow this logic, the only solution seems to be the mass suicide!
fortunately for him, the author does not seem to apply this logic to himself if humanity is not nothing, why do another book?
indeed to this book, we must destroy more trees, which will not improve the condition of the planet.
the author advocates back in the 60s specifically.
but why the 60 and not 30, for example?
