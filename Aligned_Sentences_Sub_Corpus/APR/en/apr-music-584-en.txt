1984: our favorite metallers birth of their second opus and sway in our ears a sound called new wave thrash (metallica co-progenitor of this movement with "hell awaits" by slayer).
dice "fight fire with fire" we take the full lugs and realizing they have grown, matured and that it would be very bad for competition! "for whom the bell tolls" is solemn wish, "fade to black" is melodic enough to take us to the guts, "creeping death" is the single thrash whose rhythmic play between serotonin neurons and finally our "call of ktulu" concluded that this stately remain the thrash: ride the lightning.
why 4 stars and not 5?
