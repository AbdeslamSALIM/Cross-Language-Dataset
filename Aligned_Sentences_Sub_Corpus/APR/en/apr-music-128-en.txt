i will not comment here recorded music itself well known elsewhere, but only the mix featured on this disc specific.
it goes without saying that if it was the only way to hear raw power, it would be necessary.
besides, this mix is perhaps not as flaws but it seems to me that the views expressed in the two previous comments is not the only legitimate and i just want to express another.
indeed, the glee felt listening to the search and destroy that has long inflated fantasy soon gives way to feelings of loss of the poetry of the original mix.
this poem was precisely the sensations of sounds paradoxical scales and locations offset: huge guitars all in one small corner, huge drums in the foreground, etc., all in a spacious stereo.
one key here is in a fundamental ambiguity of the stooges and iggy pop on one side the primary hard rock and primitive, the other claims to art rock.
by mixing raw power, david bowie had been a real adventure and had justified the second aspect.
in the remix, iggy has yielded to the fear of heights (sound everywhere all the time, 0 db dynamic range), made this wonderful drive a steamroller uniform from first to last second, stopping carefully any space where something could happen.
the acceptance of risk ( "gimme danger") is not always where you think.
in my opinion, iggy raw power lowered very close to any hard disk.
in conclusion, my preference is very much at the bowie mix.
but beyond this personal opinion, they choose according to their predilections, those who lean toward the hard and more recent works of iggy may prefer the mix 2 and those whose tastes lead them instead to the idiot zombie birdhouse or may find more satisfaction with the mix 1.
but nothing prevents, or should, listen to both grasp the issues.
exactly, what finally tipped my decision on this subject recording is that the two mixes there have not been included, but the vast differences between the two amply justified and that the time available on cd permitted widely.
