who of us has never dreamed of, came to his great age, of having always the same drive, the same curiosity and generous heart that even charles aznavour?
c is very health of this insolent than most internationally known artists hexagonal launches today a new project of that scale when it has just completed a triumphant tour solidly supported the 2 inseparable brothers martineau?
in the line of salvatore adamo, "is the great charles who is his double album of duets, sumptuously seconded the gratin international singers brightest of their generation (which often n is not that of marley, c is say if the man takes the road without problem alongside the "youth" fiery).
i am quite agree with d one of the comments above, some orchestras are sometimes a bit risky, but do not spoil our enjoyment, all tracks are beautifully performed and not once the great charles blush naa comparing those with the accompanying.
one feels at throughout the album the warmth and tenderness of the "star" who has been able to trust those who dared challenge was rubbing his oauvre.
maybe not a major piece of the discography of the great master, but certainly quality time song and an original way to revisit the work of this monument of french chanson!
