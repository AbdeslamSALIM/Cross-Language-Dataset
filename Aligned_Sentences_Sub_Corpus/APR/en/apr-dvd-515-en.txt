imagine a movie: a grandmother who can invasive speak their sores and who prefers animals to children.
her daughter student, pro-hippie-hippie, who induces the most possible money to his parents while criticizing capitalism.
macquerelle a mother who uses girls from the east.
and in the face of men, their husbands or lovers, and mild patients who fail to meet their whims and eternal dissatisfaction.
you would have seen a film (and rightly) as deeply mysogyne.
in chaos, you reverse the roles, you make every man present at the display at best a bastard at worst a garbage, each woman victim, and you have a film that pleases the public.
after the woman-object, we enter the era of man-abject.
this slight caricature of the company to better highlight the problems.
what bothers me, by cons is that the film pulls in one direction.
