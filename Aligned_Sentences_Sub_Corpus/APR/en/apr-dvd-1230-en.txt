the qualities of this cartoon is no longer evident.
in the small world of animation, this dreamlike film, drama and littered hope appears as a single comet, a jewel to keep.
in this sense, this film is as much for adults as children.
it is a fable drawer on the family, destiny, friendship, adventure, torment, love and death.
the multi-theme of this movie is its wealth as well as its aesthetic perfection.
