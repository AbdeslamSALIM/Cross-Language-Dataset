the film tends to rely too much on special effects to impress the viewer.
it is not messing around, it's light years (nay of parsecs) behind the first three components (in order of release of course).
i take as an example the story of love not as a subtle (not as between january and leia or a real game of hide and seek with good support to the valves had been established).
it's a shame to force the players to see change in scenery they have never seen in real life, there comes a feeling of superficiality "work".
there are even one or two scenes downright laughable, ridiculous show.
well ok i am severe, but to compensate with the other reviews not enough goals for my taste.
