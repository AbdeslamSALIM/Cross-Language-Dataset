bearing interest to different fields of investigation that paul ricoeur has particularly extensive in the last period of his artworks, the no. 33 of the magazine "cities" (2008) gives us the opportunity to discuss the "philosophy of hand." the article by olivier abel (president of the fund ricoeur) invites us to it.
as the title indicates, we are rather at the border of a sociology of human relations and theology charity.
the theme of the border and the boundary is important in the epistemology of ricoeur, but also in his ethics, and the curious relationship that operates between philosophy and theology: the limit is a place of reversal that does not designate as a beyond, it returns us to below.
the world of "neighbor" is that relationships short, immediate, where most trade takes place between people who know.
the world of "socius" is one of many relationships, mediated by circuits and complex class anonymous.
recension of this title is presented in http://www.
