i fell from the clouds: elie chouraqui said to have inspired the wonderful film by claude sautet, to make this film.
at least, he explained, he thought to caesar for the character played by gérard darmon.
the father who is not a good light.
sort of bastard egoist who thinks only of his money and that his features arrogant actually tons better hide his emotions, supposedly.
darmon has nothing to fuck this role.
that the film ends to move to another project.
and frankly from chouraqui, is rather lamentable that comparison.
this film is a big stew power 10, avoid at all costs.
she portrays the role of a small bourgeois parisian farts higher than his ass and knows how to practice free love (a guy i am and when i'm sick, i threw in the trash like a kleenex).
this, understandably, do not want another dad.
so when marc lavoine arrives (he also in his role as handsome twink trying to soften the boy is clumsy), it is a little tussle.
but chouraqui, from a delicate and very difficult, made a grotesque comedy and boring.
i went to see this film in spite of me (that day i was on guard at a local cinema where i worked as a volunteer).
in short, all that to say that the scenes supposed to be funny are downright loupées, chouraqui do not know what it is comedy, let alone film.
he'd better stop, look, it would be better for him, his players and cinema.
ps: it seems that filmmakers today do not know how good films.
worse yet, where is their courage, artistic and intellectual? : either they are in or the comedy grotesque and vulgar, tasteless, without respect for either the audience or to the cinema.
