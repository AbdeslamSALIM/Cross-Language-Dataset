sorry but the solo album skin is a disappointment.
when announcing the split of skunk anansie i thought why not good, we'll get to something fresh and new.
it serves the same unimaginative melodies and even mid-song fragile, half-plaintive.
except that they forgot the emotional journey, it is well done but you do not believe we can not fit inside, the magic is over.
and the music is flat, uninteresting, without relief, without added value.
sos is sought (..) a cylinder of inspiration for skin.
