the production of this album is touted and commercial.
this is desmond child, who has worked with aerosmith and bon jovi (sic) who produced the album.
the good news is some good songs nonetheless: feed my frankenstein (remember wayne's worlds ") and hey stoopid.
the second (very) good news: there are many other albums by alice cooper far better, that deserve more than one lingering - all those 70s and even the latest: dragon town .
