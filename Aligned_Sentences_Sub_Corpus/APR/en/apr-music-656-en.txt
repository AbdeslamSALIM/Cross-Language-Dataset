above all, we must appreciate the hoarse voice of joey starr when he is solo.
here it is no longer the case.
one is even tempted to believe that the music of ntm, it is him (pardon kool shen).
rap war, sounds great, and the omnipresent shadow of ntm. "i come" off the pavement, "soldiers" is imbued with the atmosphere brilliant lowland districts in anger, "métèque" is a beautiful fable of modern times (with judicious borrowings) ...
those who missed the group feel the adrenaline of the first plays of "paris sous les bombes" and "supreme ntm".
but ntm is not just one man, and the delicate balance between kool shen and joey starr was not at the rendezvous.
the lyrics are less processed, and the pleasure of decoding or admire the work of the text is smaller.
anyway, joey starr signed a remarkable first record, managing to assert its own style.
a challenge in itself given the powerful image of ntm.
