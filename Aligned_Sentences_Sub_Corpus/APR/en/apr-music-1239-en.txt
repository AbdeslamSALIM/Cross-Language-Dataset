really a superb record: that of a renaissance of sorts, perhaps the first to buy to get patty griffin (but what?
they are all events in itself!) - patty griffin is a singer with amazing voice, powerful and rich, and is also someone who has something to say?
no "message" here, but every time evocations deep and rich ( "chief", "rain," "making pies"), moments of life (it is no wonder the remake of "stolen car" springsteen, very good!).
the orchestration here is profoundly original: while we here guitar, piano, strings, sound deeply inspired country, of course, but also vibraphone, accordion.
i discovered in 2007, and for me the record of the year!
