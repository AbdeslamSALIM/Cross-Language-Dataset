louis de fun√®s, 68, turned his latest film ...
it's pretty sad indeed that he has finished on the film.
fufu appears only as a shadow of himself, even worse than in the extra-terrestrial.
it is also the last film of john girauly, director inseparable greatest popular success fufu ...
very few good sequences to remember, but was seen again with obviously a lot of nostalgia.
