the story is not too bad for those who love the genre.
but the style is abominable!
the passage of the accident is such that successive incomprehensible medical terms.
one has the impression that marc levy has spent days looking for words and phrases in a dictionary and he has put together.
the book is difficult to read and it is hard to take a real pleasure.
better yet watch the movie!
