when iggy and his crew recorded raw power, the record label has somehow vetoed the release of the album.
and the classic circulated for over two decades in that form there.
when iggy pop has taken over the mixing of the now legendary album, we could therefore expect to recover a lost a little wildness.
and this is the case !!!!!
in the new mix, the album sounds even closer to the group's first album, and songs like "search and destroy" or "i need somebody" deserve finally sound that dared hope for years.
the album was already an indispensable with the remix of iggy, it becomes a cornerstone of 70's rock.
