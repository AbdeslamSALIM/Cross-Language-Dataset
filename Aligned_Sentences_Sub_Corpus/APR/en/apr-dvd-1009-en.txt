super series edition for a shameless!
the price is a joke, 40 euros for 13 episodes knowing that the series will surpass 200 episodes!
the sound image is no longer correct, the episodes are not lectured so you must type the generic all the time or to fast forward (time of vhs ok, but with a dvd drive it a little heavy it feels that the dvd has the hard and the price was hard to close your eyes!) the vf i do not know i always look vostfr and it's horrible!
there are errors in the translation that provide nonsense, non attacks and franjap (in japanese like everything that just being is really what everyone calls more "bushin kage no jutsu" ...
so the cover is on a reussie it (phew).
so if you was a minimum required (for the price, i think so) if you are one of the great majority of people who look in the vo japanime you flip on the fansub, c ' these are the guys who should make the dvd would be quality!!
