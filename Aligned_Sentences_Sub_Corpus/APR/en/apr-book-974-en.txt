difficult to judge an album of a series that is planned include more than 100 in fine ...
however, i have trouble finding the link between this album and the rest of the series: where is it where leads there?
unfortunately, it would be intolerable not to have one albums in the series, and therefore, this comment does not discourage any potential buyer.
the real danger is that sfarr and trondheim tire en route and stop the saga.
for their own safety, i do not recommend them!
