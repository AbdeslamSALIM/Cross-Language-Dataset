a dvd that has been little desire to talk.
it has the advantage of learning things from people who want to discover this period of history. ...
the outlines are accurate, but the secondary characters are caricatures, not to say defamed!
poor marshal ney is a cowardly, senile ...
do not use the dvd for you form an opinion on specific characters.
otherwise, the players are correct.
poas it is for me the worst of this dvd.
