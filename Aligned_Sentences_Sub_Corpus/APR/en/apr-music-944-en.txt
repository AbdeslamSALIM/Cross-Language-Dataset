when, like me, it was blown by "burn my eyes", the first opus devastating combo, you can hardly enjoy it.
all that remains here of machine head for ultra-edgy "davidian" (as we worship it or not) is a succession of gimmicks such as redundant and unnecessary use of excessive harmonics, soon becoming the only dressing staff clumsy riffs heard a million times, and drum breaks phones that remind us that chris kontos was no stranger to the quality of the first disc.
machine head foreshadowed his future forfeiture (logan mader left) with this embarrassing failure to exercise always difficult second album.
the only star i attribute back to the perfect production (as usual) by colin richardson, in which rob flynn prefer thereafter ross robinson (korn, slipknot ...).
