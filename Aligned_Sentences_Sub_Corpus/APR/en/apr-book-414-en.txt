although i think it does not yet include the history and humor, my little boy 19 months already loves this book because the illustrations: they are classic (unlike other books with his illustrations very artistic, certainly, but where it can not easily tell if a frog ...), quite different from one page to another and in sufficient detail to be full of interesting things to point (the flower on the hat the ball in the basket ...).
in addition to its small size is easy to handle for him and it carries very easy to read on the train for example.
