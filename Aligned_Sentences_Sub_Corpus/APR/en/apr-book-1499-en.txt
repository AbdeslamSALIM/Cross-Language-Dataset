i read this novel based on comments from readers.
so i expected something great and amazing it is true that i was not disappointed: this book reads fast enough, the author makes us travel and surprises us by so many twists, action and suspense.
the end of the book is not really disappointing, everything falls into place and cleverly leaves us astounded.
moreover, the context of this survey is totally new, finally something different from what has already been written.
