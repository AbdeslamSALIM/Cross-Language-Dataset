not only technically, this film is a true jewel of innovation, i find it beautiful in all respects.
there are no children at home, yet this dvd is one of the favorites here: i am going on and returns to the big tirades dory, my favorite character (she looks like me, it seems!) i twist and laugh.
a real film anti-depressant, which i'm sure will appeal to my children, whatever their age: there are things to take for everyone of all ages, all sexes, all cultures.
a great moral lesson, and a magnificent film in every respect.
