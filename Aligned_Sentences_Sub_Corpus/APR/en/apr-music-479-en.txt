already i felt very very right tommy, quadrophenia but is even worse!
the problem is the same as for tommy: the who did not take the ramp on 4 sides in a row.
even if the concept by a very good idea, group is lost by too much diversity among hard rock, prog rock and country!
and to make matters worse the mix is completely missed (tell pete)!
