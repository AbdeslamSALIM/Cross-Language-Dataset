this book looks like the pages of our newspapers women who boast of brand name products that pay their money quietly and then say we 'know'.
do not expect advice seriously, it's blabla advertising.
if you are looking for a book that informs you really on the topic, see the exmeple by rita stiens (the truth about natural cosmetics), it is currently available in health food shops or the like naturalia vie claire where you can browse to to judge what is before investing.
fr 'guide bio cosmetics', you will see that the first 'critical' has been posted by the author of a book which, moreover, has very generously given the maximum score (how amazon can tolerate that?).
then, two people have posted negative opinions, and immediately after these negative opinions, you see any clouds of opinion and little hyper positive arguments (the girlfriends of the authors called to the rescue, perhaps?).
