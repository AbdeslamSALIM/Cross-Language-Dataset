and yet, this book is very badly werber écrit.
on not escape the clichés mass: the scientist in the long beards, those are found in the brewery down the newspaper, characters with names and characters to be pushed too crédibles.
werber is a good scientist, no doubt, he knows whereof he speaks, and the various theories about the origins of mankind (darwin, lamarck ,...) are very well exposed.
not so sure ...
