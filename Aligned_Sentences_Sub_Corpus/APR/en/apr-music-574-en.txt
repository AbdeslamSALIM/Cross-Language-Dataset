obituary is on death us a pioneer group: this group of florida has somehow created the genre while pointing to a line of conduct, an attitude error.
after changes in regular guitarist, the group has gradually lost its prestige: the studio albums were lost as it gained in production.
yet on stage, never dropped obituary: this is where the group finds its full potential ...
and "dead" is for this reason, their best album: the sound is perfect (listen to me this drum sound to my headbanger concierge) and the band tighter than ever.
low (very doom and earned obituary be compared to black sabbath) is the recognition among all supporting an inimitable voice, hate.
the powerful riffs of their compounds provide the careful listener attention easy.
do not hesitate any longer and throw yourself in the pogo crazy listening to all this top speed disk deeath huge!
