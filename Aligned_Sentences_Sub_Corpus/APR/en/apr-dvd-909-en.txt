although dating to the years 60, this film has retained his rhythm.
action, espionage, surprises await you in this must-gender.
the music also contributed to making this work a highlight.
only (big) flat: the scenes in german, so many are not subtitled in the french version, which becomes annoying in the long run, because some tirade lasting several minutes.
and watch the whole movie in french subtitling is not an acceptable solution ...
