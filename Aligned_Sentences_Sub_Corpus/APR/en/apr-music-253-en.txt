there are moments like this, we plug the radio was installed in her bathroom and it is relaxing, leaving waves gently rocked us.
and then sometimes they cut the water, one is struck by the alchemy of voice and melody.
one wonders who may well make this wonderful and we learned at the end of the broadcast: carla bruni.
reminds me, in the casualness, the pieces of jeanne moreau.
