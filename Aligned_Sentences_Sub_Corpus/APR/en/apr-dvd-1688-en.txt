execrable film for two reasons.
firstly if michael white is doing well, this is not true of michel serrault, however much i appreciate that.
on the other hand, this film does not respect the truth of the matter.
it is based on the rantings of a journalist who sets out ideas (ideas) but do not check.
read about this book by jean-charles deniau and madeleine sultan who "they" have met the famous bartowski in germany, william reymond has absolutely not done.
but in fact, william reymond is it not a journalist who has solved the murder of jfk?
