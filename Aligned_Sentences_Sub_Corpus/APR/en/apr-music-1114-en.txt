three years after the last roxy music ( "avalon") almost made it all by himself, bryan ferry puts the cover under his name.
but this time, mayonnaise, if it takes in terms of arrangements, sumptuous, quickly turned round at the compositions, especially in the second half of the disc.
fortunately, there's always excellent "slave to love" and only 2-3 interesting titles ( "sensation", "windswept").
but we expect better from a ferry that 3 interesting tracks on 9!
