after passing through the very wild mood swings, this bloodflowers was right full of praise, but it's still a very average album, lacking depth, and never taking the guts to be a good album of the cure is supposed to.
everything is too nice and too soft.
fortunately the self-titled album released in 2004 recitif√© shooting very beautiful way.
