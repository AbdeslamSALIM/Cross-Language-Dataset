i agree, the first volume is better, he would renew the concept.
but that winks tasty!
and it's still a great lesson that we give these heroes of the past: we take in hand, do not give up.
whether michelangelo, agatha christie, cyrano, they commit us to move our buttocks and we cling to our dreams.
it's not just a joke in the comics, right?
i sign for a volume 3!
