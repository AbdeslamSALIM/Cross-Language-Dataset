they gave me this book and it is with a spirit of "virgin" that i read.
it's hard to start but once the characters established, we follow with pleasure the plot.
the real subject is the world immagine by greg keyes, close to the middle ages "naturalist" with a touch of magic.
the 2nd volume does not disappoint and we expect the 3rd with pleasure.
