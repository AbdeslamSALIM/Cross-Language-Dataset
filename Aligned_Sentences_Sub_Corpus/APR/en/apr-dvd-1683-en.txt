you loved the first.
so i warn you, this film dares to take the lines of the first, to make a sequel to a level ...
actually, the scenario is especially fishing.
between the first plagiarism, use of gender stereotypes, see the ridiculous (the intrusion of the fantastic in the film, it becomes heavy), this scenario has nothing of the first component.
the missing players were already a handicap, but ...
so we will keep only the musical moments, which remain the same level as the first part!
it's sad, but hey, do not ask for much in this second part!
and do not compare to the first as i do!
