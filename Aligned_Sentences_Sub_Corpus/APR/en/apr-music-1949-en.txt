hello friends, i am delighted that this album unleashes passions.
in fact, i'm listening loop, i find only a series of riffs but frankly own trash, but above all irrelevant ... (ooh there i'll knock m'faire by fans ...).
i remain much marble before the final masterplan (though with mike terrana).
noise, organized, clean, but sterile.
for music i put 1 star, and because it's christmas soon and that the cover is rigolotte, i added a second.
sorry, but i have not hooked.
