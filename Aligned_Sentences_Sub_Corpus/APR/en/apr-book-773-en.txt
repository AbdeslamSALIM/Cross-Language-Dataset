if you read a mary higgins clark, have they all read?
i liked "i gave you my heart" (his last novel and my first novel by the author) i took it to fortunately the bible (but i ordered two on amazon, i hope i will not be disappointed and came across a bad period of the author) his last gave me the desire to read the police (i read very little) but there in the early chapters i discovered the culprit short, no desire to continue in these conditions.
i think it was sloppy and especially that most of his books are mirrors. ..
sometimes you can find the culprit and find the mood and psychology of the characters interesting!
this is not the case here!
so bye bye this novel, i hope the other two i ordered will reserve the best times ...
if i pass to agatha christie (i "death on the nile" and ordered to read "ten little niggers" to read if you do not read any ...
