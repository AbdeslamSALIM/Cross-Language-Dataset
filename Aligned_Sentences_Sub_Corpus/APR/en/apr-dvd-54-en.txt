i first saw a sneak preview of the animation festival in annecy in 2009 and expects to acquire as dvds; amazement, the author of "strange christmas carol" is not tim burton then screenwriter, but henry selick, yet he is the father of coraline!
the film inspired by a dark tale of the english writer neil gaiman, published in 2002.
the graphics are very close to key burtonienne, but the inspiration is offset from a touch less and less black.
my son of 4 years and half loved the movie, he simply told me that coraline must be absolutely prevented as buttons instead of eyes that can not be normal!
probably a trap is woven around the little girl alone.
we find inspiration time (subject to economic difficulties parents &amp; difficult to spend time in the world of childhood), the theme of uprooting the child as in the adventures of spiderwick), the secondary characters are engaging and can effect may also be perceived as frightening.
a very good time to do this movie well tied awarded the crystal feature this year at annecy mifa; animated film made in stop motion;
