as much i loved the first production of neal morse - including the religious side does not repelled me more than that - as i think it starts to turn around.
neal has that faith still pegged to the body and the topics covered by his writings are similar, happening again (though), but i have the impression that the music gods have abandoned our preacher.
even if the original dish was delicious, it is urgent to change the recipe.
damage in any case, if they know the musical qualities of neal and his flock, one begins to dream of a shift.
