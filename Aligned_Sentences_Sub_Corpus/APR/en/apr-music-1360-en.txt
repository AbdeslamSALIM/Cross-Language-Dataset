no, we could not of course expect anything better from the punk-let us laugh! - the star ac '.
nothing is flat.
jerm 'has no voice, sings almost fake.
the instruments are missing the point.
purchased this cd if you want to get an idea of what is worse in music, or other idea, if you want to laugh in ten or twenty years listening to the crap (sorry the word) of our time.
compra even when this cd, i'll tell you if you know music side too buy a cd and no vau least you laugh, provided you have 20 euros to fuck up!
come on, hello and good fun!
