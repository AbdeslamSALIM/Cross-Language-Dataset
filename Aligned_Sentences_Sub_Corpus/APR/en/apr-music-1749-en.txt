ac / dc album delivers a more bluesy than usual.
we find of course the riffs that made the group's strength ( "hail caesar", "ballbreaker", "hard as a rock") but also titles which would have made honorable b-sides ( "cover you in oil" "love bomb", "caught with your pants down", "whiskey on the rocks").
the song "burnin 'alive" recalls "two's up" to "blow up your video", while the blues speaks very clearly on "boogie man".
the sound, clear and void, is rather dry with a glaring lack of heat.
in the end, despite the return of phil rudd on drums, we feel that the young brothers have written songs of the century.
we listen hard because it is the australians, but otherwise, it would deadlock because the trade talks more than the artistic success.
