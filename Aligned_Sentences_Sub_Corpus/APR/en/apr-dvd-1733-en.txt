very few songs, a maximum of blabla.
blabla interesting, certainly, but far less than seeing the singers (sometimes beginning at the time) in what they do best: sing.
the most infuriating is that the documentary denise glaser concludes the dvd, you can see snippets of these same programs in which the singers sing.
thus, these passages have been cut.
the box is in my opinion for those nostalgic denise glaser.
