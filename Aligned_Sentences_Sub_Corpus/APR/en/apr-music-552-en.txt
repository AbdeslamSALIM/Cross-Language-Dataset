an honest desire to listen again and again and always see more.
musically it's well done, well mixed, well recorded.
a good product.
the compositions are thoughtful and musically arranged.
a voice that fit well in the frame, which exceeds nowhere.
as for the texts obvious lack of substance.
again, that's all flat, all smooth.
