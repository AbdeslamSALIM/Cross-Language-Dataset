a film or rather a fable!
before the avalanche of absurdities, inconsistencies, image synthesis and failed to pull larigot, humor finally if it's called humor cheap, i found myself speechless!
but that is sean connery in such a nanar?
did he need a stamp whatever to fill here and there holes?
one tries to imagine the answers to this question when the film ends.
finally a sense of regret after watching the movie!
