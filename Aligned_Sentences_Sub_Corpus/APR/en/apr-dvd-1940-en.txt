released in the midst of war (1945), "adventures in burma" was promptly removed from the circuit anglettere.
the cause: too much bias showing the country's liberation by american troops only when the british army played an important role, completely ignored here (except for a citation in the final credits).
in an almost documentary style, we are witnessing the raid of a section of american paratroopers against a japanese base, and then retiring under the harassment of the enemy decided to take revenge.
the dvd offers bonus 2 great shorts military training (one color and one b / w) from the conflict (1941 and 1943) among others with ronald reagan and george tobias, both of length + / - 20 '.
these documenrs rare and exciting (for fans) a complete edition recommended.
