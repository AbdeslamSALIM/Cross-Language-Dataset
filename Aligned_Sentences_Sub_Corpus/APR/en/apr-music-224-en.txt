i discovered sandrine kiberlain with the title "y'a du monde", a pop song, light and refreshing.
unfortunately the rest of the album does not continue its momentum.
certainly, the key here is simplicity in writing sandrine, a little too much elsewhere, but the melodies are far from being catchy.
nothing in association souchon (alain this time) and sandrine kiberlain not seduced.
the few songs they made together are also the most boring of the album.
too bad it does not merely that of the son to call. [...]
