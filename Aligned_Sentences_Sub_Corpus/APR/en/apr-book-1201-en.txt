the story is somewhat interesting.
the only interest i have seen in this book is that it shows that we can use published texts of quite partial to convince.
of course a lot of stupid things are said and it is easy to show the contrary as the author does.
but to deny global warming or the consequences of pollution or overconsumption with a pseudo thriller.
