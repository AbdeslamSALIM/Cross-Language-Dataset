this is actually a dragon egg that hatches and eragon applies to a pupil.
is he the worthy heir of the dragon knights, over there the lord malefique?
i'm not at all like this book for lack of originality that has already read a lot of fantasy and style abuses descriptions, adjectives multiplied unnecessarily.
like what it does not save the elves, a little magic, and an orphan predestined to make a good novel!
if this is the first of its kind that you read, can be found there with your eyes!
