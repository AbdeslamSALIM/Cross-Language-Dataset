blier hilarious as always and it's rare road!
lino do not get double belmondo and provocative one loves.
i think this comedy of fifty years of age with a hint of exotic adventure in the desert still going thanks to the dialogues audiard, below the level of taxi for tobruk.
film franchouillard may be, but it feels good and relaxes.
