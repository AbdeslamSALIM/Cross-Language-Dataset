this book is simply outstanding!
in fact, i do not think it was possible to present themes yet simple enough (radioactivity, the atom ,...) in a manner as incomprehensible.
it is a real feat stephen klein has succeeded with this work.
finally, one gets the impression of flying over the history of physics, having met most of the major theorists, without having seen the shadow of an explanation of the phenomena.
