contrary to the commentary seb, i found this book very handy.
there are certainly some errors as ig cassoulet actually nonzero.
but the rest of the line shows that there are good carbohydrates and nbreuses more important it is limited to diabetics.
the pages are in the right order (that your copy is bad seb!) and above there are no errors on the quantities of g, l or p for the nbr is noted for the amount indicated.
so for the nutella no error is noteworthy because of 15gr of study drug and not the value as 100g on the jar.
so monsieur seb should seek to better understand the table before criticizing this fabulous tools that nonetheless merit, pocket size, bring together 1140 food!
very useful for diabetics.
