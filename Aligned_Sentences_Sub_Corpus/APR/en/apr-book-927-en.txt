michael marshall, writer of genius "brethren of flesh", the "prey of dreams" and the trilogy of "straw men" did not know where to make his plot.
the first half of the book wanders d ' one character to another.
some are killed, others killed and the hero is bored.
the style is any good with some unexpected outbreaks.
it deliberately focuses on ordinary life, it pays tribute to many pages, either, but the way he does bad luck of nostalgia.
everything indicates a pre-editing support for filmed; bad for literature.
a walk with ghosts in the machine could load the atmosphere, details of the "possessions" and the inner struggles too, but none of that.
the surge in the net stack unwinding and that is the hero who reads an explanation to the phenomenon of "intruders" written by a stooge who died in battle. 3 pages quickly folded.
and it reminds scalped the end of the trilogy of "straw men" with "the blood of angels". ..
