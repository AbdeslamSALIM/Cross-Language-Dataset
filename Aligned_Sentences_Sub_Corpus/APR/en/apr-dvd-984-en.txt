a woman torn between two men: one of the past and the present.
when his old flame reappears, romy schneider is back and falls under the spell of his former lover.
yet she continues to love the man in her life, cesar (yves montand, crying for truth), but as it feels threatened, he ends up doing too much and causes the expulsion of rosalie.
the film could be called a woman and two men!
in life, maybe, but now we understand the choice of rosalie.
it takes time, leave, return, to know which of these two men she loves most. [...] love, friendships, initiatory journey, claude sautet always shows us human relations in their complexity, but also through simple things ...
cesar and rosalie is a great film to the french what counts above all is the characters and not some plot.
