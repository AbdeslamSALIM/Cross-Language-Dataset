i started this book with pleasure lively, passionate about the subject ...
the book starts well enough in the first chapter, and what a disappointment!
the author begins with a scientific approach eventually shelled a catalog of diseases with more or less related to the subject, then share it in all directions and the end is well botched.
he spends more time giving his opinion or to narrate his own adventures (what it came to that gentleman between musical hallucinations and even loss of pleasure in listening to music! .. ) it sometimes supports his statements by mail from people who recount their own experiences.
and then he can thank these people for having written the fourth book.
he should repay their copyright!
in short, we would have been happier if or christophe andr√© wrote the book as it is poorly written and quickly becomes uninteresting ..
