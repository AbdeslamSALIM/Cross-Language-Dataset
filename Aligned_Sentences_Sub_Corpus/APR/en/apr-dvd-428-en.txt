recap: season 1 medium, a very successful season 2, season 3 average, 4 successful season and we're back with a 5 year average.
just because the episodes are boring, we start with an episode christmas (??), and then follow some interesting episodes, putting aside the general history (johnny smith cons greg stillson).
so, only the last 4 (12), are successful, and offer intriguing with a lot of suspense.
hoping for a much better season 6.
