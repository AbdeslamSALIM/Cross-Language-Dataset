because i had to wait 46 years to love cats and when i say love, i would say love.
spoiling the furniture?
and bad smells.
that cat lovers forgive me, i actually thought it all!
but everything changed with the arrival of a small black cat, isis, abandoned during the removal of its "owners", traumatized by a buddy with a dog particularly aggressive.
well ok, i had a good heart to heart defending.
well it's true that now there are two: a little simpleton came to join the family, yet a hopeless case, his mistress died.
because cats are fascinating animals, intelligent, and complicit with a character very different each time.
some chapters end on the world of cat and particularly its relationship to other species.
you will understand, most are still the great photos.
and if you do not know the abyssinian cats, american shortair, blue russian, japanese bobtail and so on, you'll love.
