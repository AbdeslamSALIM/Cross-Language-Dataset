i'm going to die, it is clear, since the death of fred chinchin, guitarist of the group, we should be told nothing but praise ...
three large tubes are taken from this album is the entrenchment of rita mitsouko.
yet the rest of the album is a very particular universe.
a little too much for me.
after the first three songs, and enormous success of titles simply brilliant (and not too commercial, bearing the originality of the duo), other titles do not have that catchy side.
they are very original, but good ...
the rest of the disc has not seduced.
