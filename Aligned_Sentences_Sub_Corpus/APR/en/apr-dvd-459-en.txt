an unpretentious comedy, but a damn good time.
a fifties band decides to go on highway 66 to revive the spirit of "easy rider", and escape from the monotony of life.
from the awkward compulsive seducer, all stereotypes are present for each of us feels close to at least one of the characters.
but route 66 hidden traps and tests than they will face revealing when they have better, gay sheriff who relentlessly chasing the bad gang of bikers (extra ray liotta), they must be sublimated and sent to join their heroes in the pantheon of bikers.
it is far from a masterpiece, but for a relaxing evening of rain is quite frankly ...
each actor gives the best of his comic ability, and there would almost think sometimes.
fans of easy rider, and big harley fans, here's a film that relativize all kinds of myths, but we see all the same beautiful landscapes of the american west, and it avoids taking himself too seriously.
