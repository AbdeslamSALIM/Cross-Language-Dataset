i just bought this cd, this version is remastered, sounds are different, the tempo also increasingly mike gratifies us with lousy reviews that did not exist in this music ...
before i had the old original version that i gave to a dear friend who died of envy, contenting myself to compress mp3 on my computer (i still have at least that), a marvel, there magic in this music that has completely disappeared with the release, this cd is for me nullissime!
