a new asterix album is like a new album xiii, we realize that ultimately, the precedent was not so bad if the new scenario is bad.
the problem is that the new are rare since been removed on the right and left through the years.
for others, they can read asterix in corsica (petillon invented nothing!), la zizanie and all the other great albums from the small gallic mustache.
