i did not know that game existed for this story, since what matters here is a movie ..
start good atmosphere, good ideas, a city in fog, demonic mermaid, suspension, and one begins to appreciate again the siren and what it entails and then ..
everything becomes weak and limited ridiculissime and this time i let go, wondering how we could start so well and pick up as we fall into a puddle of mud ..
so here, the 2 stars are for the first note the rest of the film would be unhealthy for me
