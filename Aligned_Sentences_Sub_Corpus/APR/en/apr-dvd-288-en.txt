it is often said that the first season sets of all kinds are the worst (buffy, lois &amp; clark, friends, the practice, married two children ...) and beautiful (desperate housewives, smallville, charmed, supernatural and seasons following) well scott brothers for this first season is really the most sucks, it's slow, there's no action and virtually no humor, the actors are soft and quite annoying, they are tragedies for a nothing (a tattoo, it's the end of the world, lukas who wants to sleep with brooke is the end of the world) how can we drool over this season 1?
fortunately, the following are good or even excellent 4.
