a nice stew hollywood action with surreal and 2 iq.
apart from that, i am dumbfounded that today, it looks pretty horrible violence and recurring in a light, humorous, like much (hancock among others).
thus, for a film of pure entertainment wanted as a quasi "public" disgusting headshots, beatings and torture session are now incropor√©s as traditional ingredients, as we read earlier on the posters "of the action, adventure, suspense .. ..
a trivialization of violence ingrained in our time, i think.
