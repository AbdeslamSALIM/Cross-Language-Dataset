here we judge the quality of a movie, not history.
a flag has three heroes who are asked to do a show to raise funds, but that the consciousness of not being the real hero ....
the story is certainly interesting, but the film is too long and the scenario it is very short, very short; it borders on tedium.
besides, i doubt that there have been so many ships and armed forces for this battle so special?
the rest is the nostalgic, the document easy to operate.
