after andre rieu and his infernal ropes, after the boy band lyric, andrea bocelli and the star ac 'here's bartoli!
what a disappointment to see if this great artist lend themselves to this stupid game of the trivialization of classical music and opera.
some rave about the famous air standards but should, out of respect for the composer, listen to some records, certainly for older some, but oh so precious about the art of singing!
casta diva does not whispers, he sings, speaks briefly to live!
other tunes sung with virtuosity and technique are the same barrel.
remove them from their context and you have a pretty patchwork of music, sweet to the ear, gently but consecrate salty sweet (i mean the note).
urges the return of full "live" (one can dream!).
