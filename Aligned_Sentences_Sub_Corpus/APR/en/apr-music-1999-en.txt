this is probably not the album's most famous robben ford, but the stream is worth!
this is the best testimony of his style when he was regarded rather as a guitarist fusion west coast (like larry carlton, jay graydon, etc.), before imposing a more focused on the blues.
instrumental album almost in its entirety, where the chorus guitar robben dominate, the warm sound, although incisive, out of his gibson 335, his preferred at the time.
a albun has aged rather well, despite taking his "70 years" which, admittedly, a bit old (it may, moreover, contribute to the charm of the album).
