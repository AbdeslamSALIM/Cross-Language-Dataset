the musical has not been as successful as expected, yet it is the only one who can truly boast of being the heir to broadway!
the musicians are live (not a soundtrack), and the singers are full of artists who dance, play the comedy (some passages are also only played, as in the tradition of the musical) surprising .
it's lively, the music is haunting, the voices too.
a pure wonder!!
