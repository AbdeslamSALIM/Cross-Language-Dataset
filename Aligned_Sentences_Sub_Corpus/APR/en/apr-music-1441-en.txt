talented and beautiful songs.
origin persisted, we felt some difficulty in renewing itself, but citizen erased or micro cuts - which for me highlights of this album brought me a good feeling music.
the turn of the 2nd album is never easy to negotiate.
it is far from being questioned by radiohead, rock dropped from deus, the breath and the maturity of sixteen horsepower.
without denying the fact that they are very very talented guy.
the other surprise, what are the lyrics.
bellamy password may be 8 hours per day on his scratch, both on the piano - technique, technique when you would like us: it is not an album, it's a manual! - but how long is he then to write lyrics?
this is only my opinion, of course.
but after all that much mouth, words do not matter.
