how do passable (a movie) with the very void (the book) how to keep a plausible story with lies and illusions of forger?
how to hold spellbound audiences with juggling clown's pretentious?
how to translate into rhythm the absence of surprises in the book?
you said impossible.
this film was "mission impossible".
viewers who have paid to see, it is also impossible to repay ...
what does tom hanks, lost and bewildered in this film that is so sensitive and so in "philadelphia" fragile and tenacious in "cast away", disconcerting candor in "forrest gump" and so great in "saving private ryan"?
i refer the reader to my criticism of dan brown book on amazon.
