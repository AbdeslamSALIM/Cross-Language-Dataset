Although I believe that Alan Parker is an excellent and skilful movie director, this film is a mixture of unbelievable racist plot and full of blasphemy to the targeted Turkish people, therefore this movie is a shame in Parker's successful cinematography,and also for Oliver Stone(script).
There is no good Turkish people in the film(???) and imaginary middle age (??) atmosphere of prison is set in a 1970's Turkey.
