Ignore those lesser reviews and take my word for it as someone who has seen all of the best documentary series on World War 2 including the great 'The World at War', Ken Burns' 'The War' and all of the BBC series to date. 'Apocalypse' is a very good OVERVIEW of World War 2 and provides an accurate representation of the larger and more prominent events of the conflagration.
The series does not claim to be a conclusive and detailed representation and should not be viewed as such, but rather as a companion to the more detailed and of greater depth series such as the aforementioned 'The World at War' and Ken Burns ' The War' as well as the individual BBC series such as ' Nazi's: A warning from History', 'Auschwitz - The Nazis and 'The Final Solution', 'War of the Century - When Hitler Fought Stalin', 'The Road to War ', 'Battle of the Atlantic','D-Day to Berlin' and so on. 'Apocalypse' can be considered a starter course after which viewers can choose to examine particular events in greater detail by looking at the series I mention above.
Many of the clips are ones I have not seen before and so add to my own library of World War 2 documentaries.
I feel the series deserves 5 stars for effort.
Series such as these are now not shown during prime time television and so I applaud French television for showing this during peak time!
