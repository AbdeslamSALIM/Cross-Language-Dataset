The Pet Shop Boys made a bit of a splash with their first album 'Please', and their greatest hit song from that album, 'West End Girls' remains the classic Pet Shop Boys song, but it took 'Actually' to establish the duo as a group with credibility and staying power.
With this album, the Pet Shop Boys became one of the major groups of the 1980s.
