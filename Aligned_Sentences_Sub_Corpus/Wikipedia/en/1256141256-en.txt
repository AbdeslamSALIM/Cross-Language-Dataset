The first to answer his call was drummer Joey Ayvazian, and together they start auditioning singers.
They auditioned around 40 singers before David DeFeis was introduced to Jack by a friend of Joey.
Their style was and remains very original, a melding of American heavy metal and Rainbow's epic atmospheres.
The House of Atreus - Act II came in 2000 and was less heavy but more melodic than the first part.While it would be some time for a new studio album, the band did release two compilations in 2002.
The Book of Burning consists of a mixture of previously unreleased songs, new compositions created by David Defeis in collaboration with original guitarist Jack Starr, and re-recordings of various songs from the first two albums.
Hymns to Victory, consequently, is a best-of album covering the band's career from "Noble Savage" until their latest album "The House of Atreus Act II".In September 2006, after 6 years without an all-new studio album, the band released its 11th full-length Visions of Eden.
