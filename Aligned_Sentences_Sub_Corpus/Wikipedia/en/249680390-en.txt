In 1974, in Caracas, Venezuela, he faced the highly regarded Ken Norton who was 30-2, a boxer notorious for his awkward boxing style, who had broken the jaw of Muhammad Ali while defeating him on points a year earlier.
Unable to mount a significant offense, however, Frazier was eventually floored twice by Foreman in the fifth round and the fight was stopped.
Foreman finished the fight with a grotesque swelling over one eye, but was awarded a highly controversial majority decision (two judges scored for Foreman, one called it even).
