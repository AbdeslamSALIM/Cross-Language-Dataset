Together with Eli Biham, he discovered differential cryptanalysis, a general method for attacking block ciphers. (It later emerged that differential cryptanalysis was already known &mdash; and kept a secret &mdash; by both IBM and the NSA.)Shamir has also made contributions to computer science outside of cryptography, such as showing the equivalence of the complexity classes PSPACE and IP.AwardsIn recognition of his contributions to cryptography, Shamir was awarded, together with Rivest and Adleman, the 2002 ACM Turing Award &quot;ACM Award Citation / Adi Shamir&quot; at acm.org.
