The Rue de Vesle, the chief street, continued under other names, traverses the town from southwest to northwest, passing through the Place Royale.Place Drouet d'Erlon in the city centre is packed with lively restaurants and bars, and several attractive statues and fountains.
It is still the seat of an active Catholic parish holding regular worship services and welcoming pilgrims.
