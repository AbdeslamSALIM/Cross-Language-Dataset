Friedrich Carl von Savigny (February 21, 1779 in Frankfurt am Main - 25 October, 1861 in Berlin) was one of the most respected and influential 19th-century jurists.He was born at Frankfurt, of a family recorded in the history of Lorraine, deriving its name from the castle of Savigny near Charmes in the valley of the Moselle.
In this quest, particularly in Paris, he was successful.In 1808 he was appointed by the Bavarian government ordinary professor of Roman law at Landshut, where he remained a year and a half.
In 1835 he began his elaborate work on contemporary Roman law, System des heutigen r√∂mischen Rechts (8 vols., 1840-1849).
