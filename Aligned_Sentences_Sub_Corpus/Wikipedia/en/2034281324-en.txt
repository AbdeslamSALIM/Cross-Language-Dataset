Then, in 1904 a British mission under the command of Colonel Francis Younghusband, accompanied by a large military escort, invaded Tibet and reached Lhasa. (See British expedition to Tibet.)The principal pretext for the British invasion was a fear, which proved to be unfounded, that Russia was extending its power into Tibet and possibly even giving military aid to the local Tibetan government.
There is also a large Tibetan settlement in South India near Kushalanagara.
The Qinghai-Tibet Railway which links the region to Qinghai in China proper was opened in 2006.
As activists call for a boycott of the railway, the Dalai Lama has urged Tibetans to "wait and see" what benefits the new line might bring to them.
