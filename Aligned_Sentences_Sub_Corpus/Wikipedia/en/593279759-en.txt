Antipater (Greek: Ἀντίπατρος Antipatros; ca. 397 BC — 319 BC) was a Macedonian general and a supporter of kings Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great.
In 342 BC, when the Athenians tried to assume control of the Euboean towns and expel the pro-Macedonian rulers, he sent Macedonian troops to stop them.
