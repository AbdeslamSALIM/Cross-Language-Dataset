David Dacko (March 24, 1930 &ndash; November 20, 2003) was the first President of the Central African Republic (CAR), from August 14, 1960 to January 1, 1966, and the third president of the CAR from September 21, 1979 to September 1, 1981.
In order to cultivate alternative sources of support and display his independence in foreign policy, Dacko cultivated closer relations with the People's Republic of China, for example.
Dacko, for his part, was not only unharmed, but eventually returned to politics to lead a party opposed to General Kolingba.
