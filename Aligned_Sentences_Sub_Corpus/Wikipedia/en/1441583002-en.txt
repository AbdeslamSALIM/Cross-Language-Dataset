The more famous incompleteness theorem states that for any self-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (Peano arithmetic), there are true propositions about the naturals that cannot be proved from the axioms.
According to his brother Rudolf, at the age of six or seven Kurt suffered from rheumatic fever; he completely recovered, but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage.He attended German language primary and secondary school in Brno and completed them with honors in 1923.
Kurt then studied number theory, but when he took part in a seminar run by Moritz Schlick which studied Bertrand Russell's book Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, Kurt became interested in mathematical logic.Attending a lecture by David Hilbert in Bologna on completeness and consistency of mathematical systems may have set Gödel's life course.
the Peano axioms or ZFC), that:If the system is consistent, it cannot be complete. (This is generally known as the incompleteness theorem.)The consistency of the axioms cannot be proved within the system.These theorems ended a half-century of attempts, beginning with the work of Frege and culminating in Principia Mathematica and Hilbert's formalism, to find a set of axioms sufficient for all mathematics.
The incompleteness theorems also imply that not all mathematical questions are computable.In hindsight, the basic idea at the heart of the incompleteness theorem is rather simple.
During this year, Gödel also developed the ideas of computability and recursive functions to the point where he delivered a lecture on general recursive functions and the concept of truth.
This work was developed in number theory, using Gödel numbering.In 1934 Gödel gave a series of lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, entitled On undecidable propositions of formal mathematical systems.
