Thus, for hundreds of years, Chartres has been a very important Marian pilgrimage center; today the faithful still come from the world over to honour the relic.According to legend, since 876 the Cathedral's site has housed a tunic that was said to have belonged to the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Sancta Camisa.
The east end is rounded with an ambulatory which has five semi-circular chapels radiating from it.
While these figures are based on figures from the Old Testament, they were also regarded as images of current kings and queens when they were constructed.
