A pentaquark is an hypothetical subatomic particle consisting of a group of five quarks (compared to three quarks in normal baryons and two in mesons), or more specifically four quarks and one anti-quark (hence it has baryon number 1) and is represented by Î˜.
This does not cost as much energy as the creation of a particle-hole excitation, therefore the pentaquark is lighter than the 2 GeV or so that would be predicted by other constituent quark models.HistoryThe existence of pentaquarks was originally hypothesized by Maxim Polyakov, Dmitri Diakonov, and Victor Petrov at the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute in Russia in 1997, but their predictions were met with skepticism.
