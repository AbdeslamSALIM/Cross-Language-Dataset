Pillsbury appears to have contracted syphilis prior to the start of the event.
The picture of Pillsbury sitting calmly in an armchair, with his back to the players, smoking one cigar after another, and replying to his opponents' moves after brief consideration in a clear, unhesitating manner, came back to my mind 30 years later, when I refereed Alekhine's world record performance at the Chicago World's Fair, where he played 32 blindfold games simultaneously.
It was quite an astounding demonstration, but Alekhine made quite a number of mistakes, and his performance did not impress me half as much as Pillsbury's in Breslau.ReferencesExternal linksThe Boston Globe articleA New Grave Marker with Reunited Family Category:1872 births Category:1906 deaths Category:American chess playersbr:Harry Nelson Pillsbury da:Harry Nelson Pillsbury de:Harry Nelson Pillsbury et:Harry Pillsbury es:Harry Nelson Pillsbury fa:هری نلسون پیلز بوری fr:Harry Nelson Pillsbury it:Harry Nelson Pillsbury he:הרי נלסון פילסבורי hu:Harry Nelson Pillsbury nl:Harry Pillsbury pl:Harry Pillsbury ru:Пильсбери, Гарри sk:Harry Nelson Pillsbury fi:Harry Nelson Pillsbury
