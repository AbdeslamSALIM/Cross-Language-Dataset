The interlayer spacing in these devices typically corresponds to the second antiferromagnetic peak in the AFM-FM oscillation in the RKKY coupling.The GMR effect was first observed in the multilayer configuration, with much early research into GMR focusing on multilayer stacks of 10 or more layers.Spin valve GMRIn spin valve GMR two ferromagnetic layers are separated by a thin (~3 nm) non-ferromagnetic spacer, but without RKKY coupling.
To date, granular GMR has only been observed in matrices of copper containing cobalt granules.
The reason for this is that copper and cobalt are immiscible, and so it is possible to create the solid precipitate by rapidly cooling a molten mixture of copper and cobalt.
Granule sizes vary depending on the cooling rate and amount of subsequent annealing.
