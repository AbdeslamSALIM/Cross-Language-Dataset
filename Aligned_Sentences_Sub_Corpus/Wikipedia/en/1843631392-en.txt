Hewish made both practical and theoretical advances in the observation and exploitation of the apparent scintillations of radio sources due to their radiation impinging upon plasma.This led him to propose, and secure funding for, the construction of the Interplanetary Scintillation Array, a large array radio telescope at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory (MRAO), Cambridge in order to conduct a high time-resolution radio survey of interstellar scintillation.
In the course of this project, one of his graduate students, Jocelyn Bell, first noticed the radio source which was ultimately recognised as the first pulsar.The paper announcing the discovery had five authors, Hewish's name being listed first, Bell's second.
Others, however, have noted that the prize was given to Ryle and Hewish for their work across the field of radio-astronomy as a whole, with particular mention of Ryle's work on aperture-synthesis, and Hewish's on pulsars.Hewish was professor of radio astronomy at the Cavendish Laboratory from 1971 to 1989, and head of the MRAO from 1982 to 1988.
He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1968, and he and Martin Ryle were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1974.Hewish is a fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge.BibliographySee alsoNobel Prize controversiesExternal linksAntony Hewish biographyNobel speech Category:1924 births Category:Alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Category:English astronomers Category:English Nobel laureates Category:Fellows of Churchill College, Cambridge Category:Fellows of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Category:Living people Category:Nobel laureates in Physics Category:People from Foweybn:অ্যান্টনি হিউইশ bg:Антъни Хюиш ca:Antony Hewish cs:Antony Hewish de:Antony Hewish es:Antony Hewish fr:Antony Hewish gl:Antony Hewish id:Antony Hewish it:Antony Hewish sw:Antony Hewish ht:Antony Hewish lv:Entonijs Hjūišs nl:Antony Hewish ja:アントニー・ヒューイッシュ no:Antony Hewish pl:Antony Hewish pt:Antony Hewish ro:Antony Hewish ru:Хьюиш, Энтони sl:Antony Hewish fi:Antony Hewish sv:Antony Hewish tr:Antony Hewish zh:安东尼·休伊什
