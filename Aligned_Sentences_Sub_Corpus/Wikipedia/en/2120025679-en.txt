The age of the feature is constrained between 74 – 45 million years (Late Cretaceous – Eocene).DiscoveryThe crater was discovered by petroleum geoscientists Simon Stewart of BP and Philip Allen of Production Geoscience Ltd, during routine analysis of seismic data while exploring for natural gas deposits in a region 130&nbsp;km off the Humber estuary.
Withdrawal of salt deposits below the crater, known to be a mechanism for the formation of some craters, was ruled out because the Triassic and Permian layers of rock beneath the crater appeared to be undisturbed.
Another strong indication that an impact had created the crater was the presence of a central peak - something difficult to form except through a meteorite impact.Evidence for alternative interpretationsAnalysis of larger scale, but older seismic data by Professor John Underhill, a geologist at the University of Edinburgh, led to a suggestion that withdrawal of material at depth was in fact a better explanation.
Underhill found that all layers of rock down to the Permian (with an age of about 250 million years) are synclinically folded, and that sediments of this era at the crater are thinned, suggesting that the crater was forming while Permian sediments were being laid down.The existence of the central peak which seemed to strongly support the impact hypothesis was considered by Underhill to be equivocal.
These rings give the crater a somewhat similar appearance to Valhalla crater on Jupiter's moon Callisto, and other craters on Europa.
Impacting objects are generally moving at speeds of the order of 20&ndash;50&nbsp;km/s, and at these speeds an object about 120&nbsp;m across and with a mass of 2.0&times;109&nbsp;kg would be required to form a Silverpit-sized crater, if the object was rocky.
In their discovery paper, Allen and Stewart stated that Silverpit was formed in Cretaceous chalk and Jurassic shale, but is covered by an undisturbed layer of Tertiary sediment.
The Cretaceous Period ended about 65 million years ago, but, on the evidence of nearby boreholes, the lowermost Tertiary sediments appear to be absent.
Several other large impact craters of around the same age have been discovered, all between latitudes 20°N and 70°N, leading to the speculative hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened all at the same time.The collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 proved that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, giving rise to many impacts over a period of a few days if the comet fragments should collide with a planet.
