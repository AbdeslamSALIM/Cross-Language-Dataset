The experiment was conducted in 1971 by a team of researchers led by psychologist Philip Zimbardo at Stanford University.
After sensing that everyone had been too absorbed in their roles, including himself, Zimbardo terminated the experiment after six days.Ethical concerns surrounding the famous experiment often draw comparisons to the Milgram experiment, which was conducted in 1961 at Yale University by Stanley Milgram, Zimbardo's former college friend.Tom Peters and Robert H.
An undergraduate research assistant was the "warden" and Zimbardo the "superintendent".
Zimbardo set up a number of specific conditions on the participants which he hoped would promote disorientation, depersonalization and deindividuation.The researchers provided weapons -- wooden batons -- and clothing that simulated that of a prison guard -- khaki shirt and pants from a local military surplus store.
In The Stanford Prison Study video, quoted in Haslam & Reicher, 2003, Zimbardo is seen telling the guards, "You can create in the prisoners feelings of boredom, a sense of fear to some degree, you can create a notion of arbitrariness that their life is totally controlled by us, by the system, you, me, and they'll have no privacy… We're going to take away their individuality in various ways.
As punishment, the guards would not let the prisoners empty the sanitation bucket.
After only six days of a planned two weeks' duration, the Stanford Prison experiment was shut down.ConclusionsThe Stanford experiment ended on August 20, 1971, only 6 days after it began instead of the 14 it was supposed to have lasted.
