Confirmation of this hypothesis had to wait another hundred years, when William Huggins (assisted by his wife Mary Huggins) turned his spectroscope on various nebulae.
Over a period of several million years, a cluster of stars will form out of an H&nbsp;II region, before radiation pressure from the hot young stars resulting causes the nebula to disperse.
In fact, the whole process tends to be very inefficient, with less than 10 per cent of the gas in the H&nbsp;II region forming into stars before the rest is blown away.
It is only when the radiation pressure from a star drives away its 'cocoon' that it becomes visible.
The Hubble Space Telescope has revealed hundreds of protoplanetary disks (proplyds) in the Orion Nebula.
This is because over the lifetime of the galaxy, star formation rates have been greater in the denser central regions, resulting in greater enrichment of the interstellar medium with the products of nucleosynthesis.Numbers and distribution.]]H&nbsp;II regions are found only in spiral galaxies like our own and irregular galaxies.
Each star within an H&nbsp;II region ionises a roughly spherical region - known as a Str√∂mgren sphere - of the gas surrounding it, but the combination of ionisation spheres of multiple stars within an H&nbsp;II region and the expansion of the heated nebula into surrounding gases with sharp density gradients results in complex shapes.
The Horsehead Nebula and Barnard's Loop are two other illuminated parts of this cloud of gas.The Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, contains a giant H&nbsp;II region called the Tarantula Nebula.
If the Tarantula Nebula was as close to Earth as the Orion Nebula, it would shine about as brightly as the full moon in the night sky.
