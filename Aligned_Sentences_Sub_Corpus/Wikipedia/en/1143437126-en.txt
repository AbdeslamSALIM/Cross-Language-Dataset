His predecessor, Juan José Arévalo, had successfully begun a series of reforms to open the political process to all citizens.
Arévalo's extension of voting and labor rights threatened the power of the traditional elite and led to more than twenty failed coup attempts to oust him.Árbenz continued Arévalo's reform agenda and, in June 1952, his government enacted an agrarian reform program, similar to the 1862 Homestead Act in the U.S.
On January 27, 1971, Árbenz died in his bathroom, either by drowning or scalding due to hot water.
