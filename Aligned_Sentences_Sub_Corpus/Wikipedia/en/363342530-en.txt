The club surprised its own fans and others that year because they ended as runner-ups of that season.
It was also during the 2000 season that they were the second Peruvian club to win an Apertura and Clausura in a single season; the first being Alianza Lima in 1997.
The main ultra supporters groups are La Trinchera Norte (The Northern Trench), also known as a barra brava, and La Barra U Oriente.
