The decision of the Parliament of Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on holding the referendum was taken after the majority of Serb members had left the assembly in protest.These Bosnian Serb assembly members invited the Serb population to boycott the referendums held on February 29 and March 1, 1992.
Independence was declared on March 5, 1992 by the parliament.
Much of this is due to the fact that they were much better armed and organized than the Bosniak and Bosnian Croat forces.
