The set of features that go into each sprint come from the product backlog, which is a prioritized set of high level requirements of work to be done.
Which backlog items go into the sprint is determined during the sprint planning meeting.
The Product Owner writes User Stories, prioritizes them, then places them in the Product Backlog.ScrumMaster (or Facilitator)Scrum is facilitated by a ScrumMaster, whose primary job is to remove impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the sprint goal.
The ScrumMaster ensures that the Scrum process is used as intended.
As such, Scrum adopts an empirical approach &ndash; accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team's ability to deliver quickly and respond to emerging requirements.DocumentsProduct backlogThe product backlog is a high-level document for the entire project.
Tasks are broken down into hours with no task being more than 16 hours.
