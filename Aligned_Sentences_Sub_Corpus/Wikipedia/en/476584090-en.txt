He also wrote under the pseudonym Ian Stuart.LifeMacLean was the son of a minister, and learned English as his second language after his mother tongue, Scottish Gaelic.
The publishing company Collins asked him for a novel and he responded with HMS Ulysses, based on his own war experiences, as well as credited insight from his brother Ian, a Master Mariner.
The novel was a great success and MacLean was soon able to devote himself entirely to writing war stories, spy stories and other adventures.In the early 1960s, MacLean published two novels under the pseudonym "Ian Stuart" in order to prove that the popularity of his books was due to their content rather than his name on the cover.
