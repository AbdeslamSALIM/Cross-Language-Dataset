There are various causes ("polyetiology").
Whereas this form of epilepsy is relatively difficult to treat in children who do not have the chromosomal differences involved in Down's syndrome, the syndrome often affects those who do far more mildly and they often react better to medication.
Each case must be considered individually.The prognosis for children with idiopathic West syndrome are mostly more positive than for those with the cryptogenic or symptomatic forms.
Once more, the etiology of each individual case of West syndrome must be considered when debating cause and effect.As many as 6 out of 10 children with West syndrome suffer from epilepsy later in life.
