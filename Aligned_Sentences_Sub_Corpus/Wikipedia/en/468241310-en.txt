Note that Logro√±o is not a Basque town, but it was the see of the diocesis covering Zugarramurdi in 1610.
Surrounded by Romance-language speakers, the Basques traditionally spoke (and many still speak) a language that was not only non-Romance but non-Indo-European.
In fact, as Stephen Oppenheimer has stated in The Origins of the British (2006), although Basques have been more isolated than other Iberians, they are a population representative of south western Europe.
