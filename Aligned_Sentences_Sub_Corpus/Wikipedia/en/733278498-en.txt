In Scrabble tournaments a player with such a strong lead will often be paired against the highest-placed player who cannot possibly finish in the prize-winning zone; this process is known as Gibsonization after it was first applied to the US Champion David Gibson in the 1995 All-Stars tournament.
This method pairs top players more quickly than the standard method in the opening rounds* and has the effect of reducing the number of players with perfect scores more rapidly .For the first two rounds, players who started in the top half have one point added to their score for pairing purposes only.
