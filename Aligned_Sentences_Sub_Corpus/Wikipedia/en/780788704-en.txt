The most common are "software libre", "free and open source software" ("FOSS") and "free, libre and open-source software" ("FLOSS").
It is important to note, however, that in many categories, free software for individual workstations or home users has only a fraction of the market share of its proprietary competitors.
Programs indirectly connected together may avoid this problem.The majority of free software uses a small set of licenses.
The ability of users to view and modify the source code allows many more people to potentially analyse the code and possibly to have a higher rate of finding bugs and flaws than an average sized corporation could manage.
This restricts the users' freedom to effectively modify the software and distribute modified versions.
