At first, only India ink was used, then some prints were manually colored with a brush, but in the 18th century Suzuki Harunobu developed the technique of polychrome printing to produce nishiki-e.Ukiyo-e were affordable because they could be mass-produced.
The Kabuki actor Otani Oniji II in the role of Yakko (manservant) Edobe.]]In the mid-18th century, techniques allowed for production of full-color prints, called nishiki-e, and the ukiyo-e that are reproduced today on postcards and calendars date from this period on.
Utamaro, Hokusai, Hiroshige, and Sharaku were the prominent artists of this period.
The ukiyo-e of that time reflect the cultural changes.Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan became open to imports from the West, including photography, which largely replaced ukiyo-e during the bunmei-kaika (文明開化, Japan's Westernization movement during the early Meiji period).
This influence has been called Japonism.In the 20th century, during the Taishō and Shōwa periods, ukiyo-e experienced a revival in the forms of the shin hanga and sōsaku hanga movements, both aiming to differentiate themselves from the tradition of commercial mass art.
The major publisher was Watanabe Shozaburo, who is credited with creating the movement.
