Fricka is worried for her sister, but Wotan is confident that they will not have to give Freia away.Freia enters, terrified, followed by Fasolt and Fafner.
Donner (god of thunder) and Froh (god of spring) arrive to defend their sister Freia, but Wotan stops them; he cannot stop the giants by force and renege on their agreement.To Wotan's relief, Loge (the fire god) makes his entrance; Wotan has placed his hopes on Loge's cunning to find a way out of the bargain.
Loge tells them that Alberich the dwarf has stolen the Rheingold, and made a powerful magic ring out of it.
The giants depart, taking Freia with them as hostage.Freia's golden apples had kept the Gods eternally young; with her absence, they begin to age and weaken.
Troubled, Wotan surrenders the ring and sets Freia free.
Fafner clubs Fasolt to death and leaves with all the loot.
Wotan leads them across the bridge to the castle, which he names Valhalla.
