HTML, an initialism of HyperText Markup Language, is the predominant markup language for Web pages.
It describes 22 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.

Rather the X in XML stands for extensible and the W3C is modularizing the entire specification and opening it up to independent extensions.
