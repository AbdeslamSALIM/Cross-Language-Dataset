Millau (Occitan: Milhau) is a commune in the department of Aveyron in southern France.
This church allegedly once possessed a part of the Crown of Thorns, making it an important pilgrimage centre in the Middle Ages.
The church was destroyed in 1582 but rebuilt in the 17th century.
In a poignant passage, she is comforting Luc Cornet, a young soldier from Millau who is dying of severe head wounds.
