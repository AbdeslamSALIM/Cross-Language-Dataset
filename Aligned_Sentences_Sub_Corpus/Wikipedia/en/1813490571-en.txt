Nevertheless, the equipartition theorem allows the average kinetic energy of each atom to be computed, as well as the average potential energies of many vibrational modes.
The original idea of equipartition was that, in thermal equilibrium, energy is shared equally among its various forms; for example, the average kinetic energy in the translational motion of a molecule should equal the average kinetic energy in its rotational motion.The equipartition theorem makes quantitative predictions.
Like the virial theorem, it gives the total average kinetic and potential energies for a system at a given temperature, from which the system's heat capacity can be computed.
However, equipartition also gives the average values of individual components of the energy, such as the kinetic energy of a particular particle or the potential energy of a single spring.
As a consequence, the heavier atoms of xenon have a lower average speed than do the lighter atoms of helium at the same temperature.
The equipartition theorem shows that in thermal equilibrium, any degree of freedom (such as a component of the position or velocity of a particle) which appears only quadratically in the energy has an average energy of ½''kBT'' and therefore contributes ½''kB'' to the system's heat capacity.
This has many applications.Translational energy and ideal gasesThe (Newtonian) kinetic energy of a particle of mass m'', velocity '''v' is given byH^ = \tfrac12 m |\mathbf|^2 = \tfrac m\left( v_^ + v_^ + v_^ \right), where vx, vy and vz are the cartesian components of the velocity v.
Equipartition therefore predicts that the average total energy of an ideal gas of N'' particles is (3/2) ''N kBT.It follows that the heat capacity of the gas is (3/2) N kB and hence, in particular, the heat capacity of a mole of a such gas particles is (3/2)NAkB=(3/2)R'', where ''NA is Avogadro's number and R'' is the gas constant.
If such a one dimensional system has mass m'', then its kinetic energy ''Hkin is ½''mv2'' = p''2/2''m, where v'' and ''p = mv denote the velocity and momentum of the oscillator.
Each atom in such a solid can oscillate in three independent directions, so the solid can be viewed as a system of 3N independent simple harmonic oscillators, where N'' denotes the number of atoms in the lattice.
In an extreme situation, the modes are independent and so their energies are independently conserved.
However, in a process working in the opposite direction, the particles also diffuse back up towards the top of the bottle.
Hence, a protein clump with a buoyant mass of 10&nbsp;MDa (roughly the size of a virus) would produce a haze with an average height of about 2&nbsp;cm at equilibrium.
It agrees with the value (7/2)R'' predicted by equipartition at high temperatures (where ''R is the gas constant), but decreases to (5/2)R'' and then (3/2)''R at lower temperatures, as the vibrational and rotational modes of motion are "frozen out".
For molecules with very large or weakly bound atoms, ''Tvib can be close to room temperature (about 300&nbsp;K); for example, Tvib ≈ 308&nbsp;K for iodine gas, I2.]]The history of the equipartition theorem is intertwined with that of molar heat capacity, both of which were studied in the 19th century.
Derivations of the general formula are given later in the article.The general formula is equivalent to the following two:\Bigl\langle x_ \frac \Bigr\rangle = k_ T \quad \mbox n\Bigl\langle x_ \frac \Bigr\rangle = 0 \quad \mbox m \neq nIf a degree of freedom xn appears only as a quadratic term anxn2 in the Hamiltonian H, then the first of these formulae implies thatk_ T = \Bigl\langle x_ \frac\Bigr\rangle = 2\langle a_n x_n^2 \rangle, which is twice the contribution that this degree of freedom makes to the average energy \langle H\rangle.
Thus the equipartition theorem for systems with quadratic energies follows easily from the general formula.
A similar argument, with 2 replaced by s'', applies to energies of the form ''anxns.The degrees of freedom x''''n are coordinates on the phase space of the system and are therefore commonly subdivided into generalized position coordinates qk and generalized momentum coordinates pk, where pk is the conjugate momentum to qk.
If q''' = (qx, qy, qz) and '''p = (px, py, pz) denote the position vector and momentum of a particle in the gas, and F is the net force on that particle, then\begin \langle \mathbf \cdot \mathbf \rangle &= \Bigl\langle q_ \frac \Bigr\rangle + \Bigl\langle q_ \frac \Bigr\rangle + \Bigl\langle q_ \frac \Bigr\rangle\\ &=-\Bigl\langle q_ \frac \Bigr\rangle - \Bigl\langle q_ \frac \Bigr\rangle - \Bigl\langle q_ \frac \Bigr\rangle = -3k_ T, \end where the first equality is Newton's second law, and the second line uses Hamilton's equations and the equipartition formula.
However, the experimental values for molar heat capacities of diatomic gases are typically about 5&nbsp;cal/(mol·K) and fall to 3&nbsp;cal/(mol·K) at very low temperatures.
Adding the three components together gives\begin \langle H^ \rangle &= \biggl\langle c \frac^ + p_^ + p_^^ + p_^ + p_^ \biggr\rangle\\ &= \Bigl\langle p_ \frac \Bigr\rangle + \Bigl\langle p_ \frac \Bigr\rangle + \Bigl\langle p_ \frac \Bigr\rangle\\ &= 3 k_ T \end where the last equality follows from the equipartition formula.
Thus, the average total energy of an extreme relativistic gas is twice that of the non-relativistic case: for N'' particles, it is ''3 N kBT.Non-ideal gasesIn an ideal gas the particles are assumed to interact only through collisions.
The total mean potential energy of the gas is therefore \langle H^ \rangle = \tfrac12 N \langle h^ \rangle , where N is the number of particles in the gas, and the factor ½ is needed because summation over all the particles counts each interaction twice.
Thus, the average potential energy equals kBT/s, not kBT/2 as for the quadratic harmonic oscillator (where s=2).More generally, a typical energy function of a one-dimensional system has a Taylor expansion in the extension q:H^ = \sum_^ C_ q^ for non-negative integers n''.
In contrast to the other examples cited here, the equipartition formula\langle H^ \rangle = \frac k_ T - \sum_^ \left( \frac \right) C_ \langle q^ \rangle does not allow the average potential energy to be written in terms of known constants.Brownian motionThe equipartition theorem can be used to derive the Brownian motion of a particle from the Langevin equation.
The drag force is often written '''Fdrag = - γ'v'; therefore, the time constant τ equals m/γ.The dot product of this equation with the position vector r, after averaging, yields the equation\Bigl\langle \mathbf \cdot \frac \Bigr\rangle + \frac \langle \mathbf \cdot \mathbf \rangle = 0 for Brownian motion (since the random force F'''rnd is uncorrelated with the position '''r).
Using the mathematical identities\frac \left( \mathbf \cdot \mathbf \right) = \frac \left( r^ \right) = 2 \left( \mathbf \cdot \mathbf \right) and\frac \left( \mathbf \cdot \mathbf \right) = v^ + \mathbf \cdot \frac, the basic equation for Brownian motion can be transformed into\frac \langle r^ \rangle + \frac \frac \langle r^ \rangle = 2 \langle v^ \rangle = \frac k_ T, where the last equality follows from the equipartition theorem for translational kinetic energy:\langle H^ \rangle = \Bigl\langle \frac \Bigr\rangle = \langle \tfrac m v^ \rangle = \tfrac k_ T.
The above differential equation for \langle r^2\rangle (with suitable initial conditions) may be solved exactly:\langle r^ \rangle = \frac T \tau^ \left( e^ - 1 + \frac \right).
However, on long time scales, with t τ, the exponential and constant terms are negligible, and the squared distance grows only linearly:\langle r^ \rangle \approx \frac T\tau t = 6\gamma k_ T t.
This describes the diffusion of the particle over time.
An analogous equation for the rotational diffusion of a rigid molecule can be derived in a similar way.Stellar physicsThe equipartition theorem and the related virial theorem have long been used as a tool in astrophysics.
Substitution of the mass and radius of the Sun yields an estimated solar temperature of T = 14 million kelvins, very close to its core temperature of 15 million kelvins.
However, the Sun is much more complex than assumed by this model — both its temperature and density vary strongly with radius — and such excellent agreement (≈7% relative error) is partly fortuitous.Star formationThe same formulae may be applied to determining the conditions for star formation in giant molecular clouds.
The mean energy associated with this factor is given by\langle H_ \rangle = - \frac = \frac = \frac k_ T as stated by the equipartition theorem.General proofsGeneral derivations of the equipartition theorem can be found in many statistical mechanics textbooks, both for the microcanonical ensemble and for the canonical ensemble.
For a given energy E'' and spread ''ΔE, there is a region of phase space Γ in which the system has that energy, and the probability of each state in that region of phase space is equal, by the definition of the microcanonical ensemble.
Since \rho = \frac the equipartition theorem follows:\Bigl\langle x_ \frac \Bigr\rangle = \delta_ \Bigl(\frac \frac\Bigr)^ = \delta_ \Bigl(\frac \Bigr)^ = \delta_ k_ T.
Consequently, it must be possible to exchange energy among all its various forms within the system, or with an external heat bath in the canonical ensemble.
At high temperatures, the two agree nearly perfectly, but at low temperatures when kBT kBT) is almost zero.]]To illustrate the breakdown of equipartition, consider the average energy in a single (quantum) harmonic oscillator, which was discussed above for the classical case.
Its average energy is given by\langle H \rangle = \sum_^ E_ P(E_) = \frac \sum_^ nh\nu \ e^ =\frac \frac =\frac.Substituting the formula for Z gives the final result\langle H \rangle = h\nu \frac.
However, at low temperatures, when hν kBT, the average energy goes to zero — the higher-frequency energy levels are "frozen out" (Figure 10).
As another example, the internal excited electronic states of a hydrogen atom do not contribute to its specific heat as a gas at room temperature, since the thermal energy kBT (roughly 0.025&nbsp;eV) is much smaller than the spacing between the lowest and next higher electronic energy levels (roughly 10&nbsp;eV).Similar considerations apply whenever the energy level spacing is much larger than the thermal energy.
For example, this reasoning was used by Albert Einstein to resolve the ultraviolet catastrophe of blackbody radiation. .
