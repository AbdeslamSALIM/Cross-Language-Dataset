Dagen H (The H day), today mostly referred to as Högertrafikomläggningen ("The right-hand traffic diversion"), was the day, 3 September 1967, on which traffic in Sweden switched from driving on the left-hand side of the road to the right.
Bus stops had to be constructed on the other side of the street.
However, the accident rate rose back to its original level within two years.See alsoTraffic directionalitySwitch to right hand traffic in CzechoslovakiaTransport in SwedenReferencesCategory:History of Sweden Category:Transport in Sweden Category:1967 in Sweden ca:Dagen H cs:Dagen H de:Dagen H es:Dagen H eo:Tago H fr:Dagen H it:Dagen H he:יום ה-H hu:H-nap nl:Dagen H ja:ダゲン・H no:Dagen H pl:Dagen H ru:День H sk:Dagen H fi:H-päivä sv:Högertrafikomläggningen zh:H日
