Whether rotation is important in a system can be determined by its Rossby number, which is the ratio of the velocity, U, of a system to the product of the Coriolis parameter, f, and the length scale, L, of the motion:Ro = \frac.The Rossby number is the ratio of centrifugal to Coriolis accelerations.
A small Rossby number signifies a system which is strongly affected by Coriolis forces, and a large Rossby number signifies a system in which centrifugal forces dominate.
