Based on the counter, and assuming that a day is 24×60×60=86400 seconds long, the date will be calculated as 00:00:00.002 January 2 1970.
If a leap second had been added on December 31 1970, then the date would be computed as 00:00:00 on May 16, 1971.
However, because the Earth's rotation rate is unpredictable in the long term, it is not possible to predict the need for them more than six months in advance.
Between January 1972 and December 2005, the IERS gave instructions to insert a leap second on 23 occasions.
