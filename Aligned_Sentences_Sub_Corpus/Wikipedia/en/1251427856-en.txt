Stable DNA-DNA hydrogen bonds are only formed when the primer sequence very closely matches the template sequence.
No amplification is present in sample #1; DNA bands in sample #2 and #3 indicate successful amplification of the target sequence.
MSP using qPCR can also be performed to obtain quantitative rather than qualitative information about methylation.Miniprimer PCR: Miniprimer PCR uses a novel thermostable polymerase (S-Tbr) that can extend from short primers ("smalligos") as short as 9 or 10 nucleotides, instead of the approximately 20 nucleotides required by Taq.
In that study, deeply divergent sequences were discovered with high frequency and included representatives that deÔ¨Åned two new division-level taxa, suggesting that miniprimer PCR may reveal new dimensions of microbial diversity.
By enlarging the "sequence space" that may be queried by PCR primers, this technique may enable novel PCR strategies that are not possible within the limits of primer design imposed by Taq and other commonly used enzymes.Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA): permits multiple targets to be amplified with only a single primer pair, thus avoiding the resolution limitations of multiplex PCR (see below).Multiplex-PCR: The use of multiple, unique primer sets within a single PCR mixture to produce amplicons of varying sizes specific to different DNA sequences.
