Mont Saint-Michel belongs to the Organization of World Heritage Cities.Mont Saint-Michel has also been the subject of traditional, but nowadays good-humoured, rivalry between Normans and Bretons.
Bretons claim that, since the Couesnon River marks the traditional boundary between Normandy and Brittany, it is only because the river has altered its course over the centuries that the mount is on the Norman side of the frontier - as expressed in the rhyme "le Couesnon en sa folie mit le Mont en Normandie" ("The Couesnon in its madness placed Saint-Michel in Normandy").
