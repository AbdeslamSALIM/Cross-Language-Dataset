Thomas received priest's orders in 1413 and was made subprior in 1429.The house was disturbed for a time in consequence of the pope's rejection of the bishop-elect of Utrecht, Rudolf van Diepholt; otherwise, Thomas' life was a quiet one, his time being spent between devotional exercises, composition, and copying.
He copied the Bible no less than four times, one of the copies being preserved at Darmstadt in five volumes.
