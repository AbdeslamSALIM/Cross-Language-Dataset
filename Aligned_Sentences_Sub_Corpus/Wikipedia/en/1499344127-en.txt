They do, however, have the property of power associativity.Every sedenion is a real linear combination of the unit sedenions 1, e''1, ''e2, e''3, ''e4, e''5, ''e6, e''7, ''e8, e''9, ''e10, e''11, ''e12, e''13, ''e14 and e15, which form a basis of the vector space of sedenions.The sedenions have a multiplicative identity element 1 and multiplicative inverses, but they are not a division algebra.
