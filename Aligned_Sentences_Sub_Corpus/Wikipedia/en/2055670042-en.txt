Similar arguments have been proposed by David Chalmers.Kripke delivered the John Locke lectures in philosophy at Oxford in 1973.
Kripke showed how to do this recursively by starting from the set of expressions in a language which do not contain the truth predicate, defining a truth predicate over just that segment: this adds new sentences to the language, and truth is in turn defined for all of them.
Such a fixed point can then be taken as the basic form of a natural language containing its own truth predicate.
