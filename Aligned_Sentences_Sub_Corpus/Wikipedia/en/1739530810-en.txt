Maintaining and decommissioning a commercial reactor may thus be difficult and expensive.
Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power all have a relatively low power output per square kilometer compared to ITER's successor DEMO which, at 2000 MW, should have an energy density that exceeds even large fission power plants State Nuclear Industry - Arizona&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;AssessmentITER has decided to ask AIB-Vinçotte International (an inspection organisation located in Belgium and accredited by the French Nuclear Authorities ASN) to assess the confinement vessel, heart of the project, following the French Nuclear Regulatory requirements.See alsoDEMOWendelstein 7-XInternational Fusion Materials Irradiation FacilityFusion powerNuclear power in FranceHiPERReferencesExternal links ITER home page, includes pictures and diagrams available to use for educational purposesITER Design Thorough overview of entire projectBeyond ITER The timescale to a commercial fusion power plant by 2050.ITER Technical ObjectivesFrench Government ITER pageCEA ITER pageCommission particulière du débat public Projet ITER (French site)EFDA home pageIFMIF home page.FIRE home page, with current news on ITER and other burning plasma developmentsPrinceton Plasma Physics LaboratoryThe Fast Track To Fusion Power by Chris Llewellyn Smith of the UK Atomic Energy AuthorityITER-NL Netherlands ITER industry portal (in DutchClimate Change Chronicles article about France winning the ITER contractITER and ORNLFusion reactors explained by HowStuffWorksUnofficial ITER fan clubIPR Institute for Plasma ResearchWhat is a megaproject?
