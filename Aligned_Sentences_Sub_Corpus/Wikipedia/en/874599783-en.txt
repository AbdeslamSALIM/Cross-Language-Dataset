Because of this, the cub was largely responsible for a significant increase in revenue, estimated at about five million euros, at the Berlin Zoo in 2007.
After an unproblematic gestation time, Knut and his unnamed brother were born on 5 December 2006.
Zoo keepers rescued the cubs by scooping them out of the enclosure with an extended fishing net, but Knut's brother died of an infection four days later.
Knut's diet began with a bottle of baby formula mixed with cod liver oil every two hours, before graduating at the age of four months to a milk porridge mixed with cat food and vitamins.
DÃ¶rflein also accompanied Knut on his twice-daily one-hour shows for the public and therefore appeared in many videos and photographs alongside the cub.
Much ado was also made about a death threat that was sent shortly before 15:00 local time on Wednesday 18 April 2007.
