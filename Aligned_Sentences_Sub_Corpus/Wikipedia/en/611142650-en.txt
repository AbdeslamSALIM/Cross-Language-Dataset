The algorithm was initially controversial with classified design elements, a relatively short key length, and suspicions about a National Security Agency (NSA) backdoor.
The S-boxes of DES were much more resistant to the attack than if they had been chosen at random, strongly suggesting that IBM knew about the technique back in the 1970s.
It was subsequently reaffirmed as the standard in 1983, 1988 (revised as FIPS-46-1), 1993 (FIPS-46-2), and again in 1999 (FIPS-46-3), the latter prescribing "Triple DES" (see below).
On 26 May 2002, DES was finally superseded by AES, the Advanced Encryption Standard, following a public competition (see AES process).
The 56 bits are then divided into two 28-bit halves; each half is thereafter treated separately.
