It is the site of Mozart's baptism.The site occupied by the Salzburg Cathedral was probably a sacred place for sacrifices in Celtic as well as Roman times.
The first Dom was recorded in 774.The so-called Virgil Dom was built from 767 to 774 and was 66 metres long and 33 metres wide.
Archbishop Arno (785 â€“ 821) was the first to arrange renovations of the Dom, which was in place for less than 70 years.
In 1598, the basilica was severely damaged, and after several failed attempts at restoration and reconstruction, the building was finally ordered to be demolished by Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich (Archbishop from 1587-1612).
Indeed, it was Wolf Dietrich who was also responsible for the building of the nearby Altes Residenz, which is today connected to the cathedral.Wolf Dietrich hired the Italian architect Vincenzo Scamozzi to prepare a plan for a comprehensive new Baroque building.
The present cathedral, designed by Santino Solari, who fundamentally changed the original Scamozzi plan was completed remarkably in less than 15 years, being finished by 1628.
