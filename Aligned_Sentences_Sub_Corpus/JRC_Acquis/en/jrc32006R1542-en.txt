Article 10 of the abovementioned Regulation requires the Commission to adjust the quotas set out in Annex III by 30 September 2006 at the latest.
However, the detailed rules laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1554/2001 to establish the flat-rate amount to cover the sea transport costs will, as from 1 July 2006, no longer be applicable following the decision of the United Terminal Sugar Market Association of London to cease setting the London Daily Price.
For each undertaking, the threshold mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be calculated by multiplying its quota mentioned in paragraph 1 by the sum of the following coefficients: (a) the coefficient laid down for the Member State in Annex I; (b) the coefficient obtained by dividing the sum of the quotas renounced in the 2006/07 marketing year in the Member State concerned under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 by the quota fixed for that Member State in Annex IV to this Regulation.
The Commission shall fix this coefficient not later than 15 October 2006.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
