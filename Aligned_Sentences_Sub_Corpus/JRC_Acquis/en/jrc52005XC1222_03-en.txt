Commission Notice on the rules for access to the Commission file in cases pursuant to Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty, Articles 53, 54 and 57 of the EEA Agreement and Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Notice on the rules for access to the Commission file in cases pursuant to Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty, Articles 53, 54 and 57 of the EEA Agreement and Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (2005/C 325/07) (Text with EEA relevance) I.
Access to the file is provided for in Article 27(1) and (2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 [1], Article 15(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 773/2004 ("the Implementing Regulation") [2], Article 18(1) and (3) of the Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 ("Merger Regulation") [3] and Article 17(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 802/2004 ("the Merger Implementing Regulation") [4].
The principles set out in this Notice apply also when the Commission enforces Articles 53, 54 and 57 of the EEA Agreement [5]. 2.
Accessible documents 10.
Non-accessible documents 3.1.
A particular case of internal documents is the Commission's correspondence with other public authorities and the internal documents received from such authorities (whether from EC Member States ("the Member States") or non-member countries).
Examples of such non-accessible documents include: - correspondence between the Commission and the competition authorities of the Member States, or between the latter [19]; - correspondence between the Commission and other public authorities of the Member States [20]; - correspondence between the Commission, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and public authorities of EFTA States [21]; - correspondence between the Commission and public authorities of non-member countries, including their competition authorities, in particular where the Community and a third country have concluded an agreement governing the confidentiality of the information exchanged [22]. 16.
These considerations apply, in particular, as regards: - documents and information exchanged pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, and information provided to the Commission pursuant to Article 18(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003; - complaints lodged by a Member State under Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003.
Confidential information 17.
Therefore the notion of other confidential information may include information that would enable the parties to identify complainants or other third parties where those have a justified wish to remain anonymous. 20.
Information will be classified as confidential where the person or undertaking in question has made a claim to this effect and such claim has been accepted by the Commission [27]. 22.
The reasons for which information is claimed to be a business secret or other confidential information must be substantiated [28].
In proceedings under Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty, the qualification of a piece of information as confidential is not a bar to its disclosure if such information is necessary to prove an alleged infringement ("inculpatory document") or could be necessary to exonerate a party ("exculpatory document").
In proceedings under the Merger Regulation 28.
Complainants do not have a right of access to business secrets or other confidential information which the Commission has obtained in the course of its investigation [39].
Preparatory procedure 35.
b) In merger proceedings - notifying parties or other involved parties making known their views on Commission objections adopted with a view to take a decision with regard to a request for a derogation from suspension of a concentration and which adversely affects one or more of those parties, or on a provisional decision adopted in the matter [46]; - notifying parties to whom the Commission has addressed a statement of objections, other involved parties who have been informed of those objections or parties to whom the Commission has addressed objections with a view to inflict a fine or a periodic penalty payment, submitting their comments on the objections [47]; - third persons who apply to be heard, or any other natural or legal person invited by the Commission to express their views, making known their views in writing or at an oral hearing [48]; - any person which supplies information pursuant to Article 11 of the Merger Regulation. 36.
Moreover, the Commission may require undertakings [49], in all cases where they produce or have produced documents, to identify the documents or parts of documents, which they consider to contain business secrets or other confidential information belonging to them, and to identify the undertakings with regard to which such documents are to be considered confidential [50]. 37.
For the purposes of quickly dealing with confidentiality claims referred to in paragraph 36 above, the Commission may set a time-limit within which the undertakings shall: (i) substantiate their claim for confidentiality with regard to each individual document or part of document; (ii) provide the Commission with a non-confidential version of the documents, in which the confidential passages are deleted [51].
In antitrust proceedings, if undertakings fail to comply with the provisions set out in paragraphs 35 to 37 above, the Commission may assume that the documents or statements concerned do not contain confidential information [53].
The Commission may reverse its provisional acceptance of the confidentiality claim in whole or in part at a later stage. 42.
In such cases, the Directorate General for Competition will inform the person or undertaking in writing of its intention to disclose information, give its reasons and set a time-limit within which such person or undertaking may inform it in writing of its views.
Requests for anonymity in such circumstances, as well as requests for anonymity according to point 81 of the Commission Notice on the handling of complaints [57] will be dealt with according to paragraphs 40 to 42 above.
The Commission may choose any combination of these methods. 45.
Corrected in the OJ L 172, 6.5.2004, p. 9. [5] References in this Notice to Articles 81 and 82 therefore apply also to Articles 53 and 54 of the EEA Agreement. [6] Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, OJ L 145, 31.5.2001, p. 43.
The same applies where a natural person is an undertaking within the meaning of Articles 81 and 82.
Commission, [1995] ECR II-1775, paragraphs 81-86, and Case T-36/91 ICI vs.
Commission [2002] ECR II-4381, paragraph 98 et seq.). [27] See paragraph 40 below. [28] See paragraph 35 below. [29] However, business secrets or other confidential information which are given to a trade or professional association by its members do not lose their confidential nature with regard to third parties and may therefore not be passed on to complainants.
