BTCs (Basic technical characteristics) (Article 3.1) BTCs of existing installations: basically no change to BTCs submitted under Regulation (Euratom) No 3227/76, except declaration of use, to be done by letter within 120 days of entry into force.
The site declaration (Article 3.2 and 3.3) 2.2.2.1.
Role of the site representative for Annex II is the following [2]: - collection of information for all buildings on the site, - transmission of the site declaration to DG TREN, - contact point for DG TREN in case of questions. 2.2.2.2.
No reporting would thus be necessary under Annex II to Regulation (Euratom) No 302/2005. 2.2.2.6.
Summary Conditions for no ANNEX II reporting: - installations holding only exempted material, - decommissioned installations, - closed-down NN-LOFs without hot cell. 2.2.3.
Particular safeguard provisions (Article 6) (PSPs) It is noted that PSPs adopted under Regulation (Euratom) No 3227/76 remain in force as they are.
Provisions specified in the PSPs take precedence over requirements of Regulation (Euratom) No 302/2005. 2.3.
Accounting system (Article 7) The system of accounting and operating records to be maintained by the operators under this Regulation is the same as was foreseen in Regulation (Euratom) No 3227/76. 2.3.2.
Examples of operating records: - results of measurements, - results of analyses, - results of evaluation, - tank calibration curves, - internal transfers, - burn up calculation, - power history, - packing sheets, - delivery order.
Inventory change report (ICR), material balance report (MBR), physical inventory listing (PIL) (Article 12 and 13) In these articles, days mean calendar days. - The frequency of transmission of the ICR to the Commission, specified in the PSPs of an installation, may be different from the monthly frequency stipulated in this article.

The last circular letter with reference E/31/921 was sent to all operators on 24 June 1998.
Derogations 2.3.7.1.
General comment Article 19 is mainly addressed to the installations using nuclear material, which is in a recoverable form and used exclusively in non-nuclear activities.
Derogation - Article 19 of Regulation (Euratom) No 302/2005 and exemption - Articles 36 and 37 of INFCIRC 193 Derogation and exemption are two different mechanisms.
The exemption is granted on the basis of the use of the material (Article 36 of INFCIRC-193) or on the basis of its quantity (Article 37 of INFCIRC-193).
Exemptions are also relevant to the implementation of the Commission Regulation due to the fact that where the nuclear material in a location outside facility (LOF) has been exempted in line with Article 36 or 37 of the Safeguards Agreement, this LOF would no longer constitute the core of a site.
Therefore no reporting would be necessary under Annex II of Regulation (Euratom) No 302/2005.
Exemption of INFCIRC 193 | Derogation of Regulation (Euratom) No 302/2005 | Exemption from IAEA safeguards means that no classical safeguards measures, including inspections, are applied on the material | Derogation means a simplification for the operator of the rule governing the format and the frequency of reporting as set out in Articles 10 to 18.
The nuclear material remains under Euratom safeguards, and is subject to control. | Nuclear material, which could qualify for exemption based on use (Article 36 of the Safeguards Agreement) is: (a)special fissionable material, when it is used in gram quantities or less as a sensing components in instruments;(b)recoverable nuclear material when used in non-nuclear activities; and(c)plutonium with an isotopic concentration of plutonium 238 exceeding 80 %. | MBA holding only exempted nuclear material will upon request be granted derogation.
In that case, derogation from reporting will be granted in such a way that the provisions of IAEA safeguards are respected (inspections, reporting to IAEA). | Nuclear material may be exempted from IAEA safeguards up to the quantities specified in Article 37 of the Safeguards Agreement. | Derogation may be granted to MBAs holding quantities of nuclear material commensurate with those specified in Annex I-G but are kept in the same state for a long period.
This includes those small holders whose inventory of nuclear material is lower than or equal to those defined in the Annex I-G to Regulation (Euratom) No 302/2005: Depleted uranium | 350000g or | Thorium | 200000g or | Natural uranium | 100000g or | Low enriched uranium | 1000g or | High enriched uranium | 5g or | Plutonium | 5g | Operators who think that they could become CAM Member, should use Annex I-G when submitting their BTCs.
For those SHNM without BTCs: CAM candidates will use the format shown in Annex I-G, whereas non-CAM candidates will use the format of Annex I-J. 2.3.7.2.
Article 19 is mainly addressed to the installations using nuclear material, which is in a recoverable form and used exclusively in non-nuclear activities.
Operators who received a derogation authorisation by letter for quarterly, semi-annual or annual declaration will be required to submit an initial request for derogation under Article 19 of Regulation (Euratom) No 302/2005.
Operators granted a derogation under Article 19 will have to declare those inventory changes which increase (new acquisitions or production of nuclear material) or which decrease (sales, transformations, transfer to waste, losses of nuclear material) the nuclear material inventory for which they have the responsibility.
In the case of exports of nuclear material to a third country, the persons or undertakings to whom a derogation has been granted shall transmit a report to the Commission as soon as possible and, at the latest, within 15 days of the end of the month in which the export occurred, using the form set out in Annex X.
Example of export report for shipment of nuclear material outside the EU (see point 2.3.6.3 below - example 3): On 12 July, a manufacturer sells gamma equipment incorporating depleted uranium to a customer outside the EU. - Using Annex X to Regulation (Euratom) No 302/2005 the export will be reported to the Commission at the latest by 15 August.
The request shall be transmitted to the Commission as soon as the transfer date is known to the person or undertaking and, at the latest, within 15 days of the end of the month in which the transfer occurred, using the form set out in Annex IX.
The containers arrive on 28 August. - This receipt is reported using Annex IX, which is the form also used for the initial derogation request. - This report should be submitted as soon as the date of transfer is known and at latest by 15 September.
