European Parliament resolution containing the comments which are an integral part of the decision on the discharge for implementing the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2003, Section III — Commission (SEC(2004)1181 — C6-0012/2005 — 2004/2040(DEC) — SEC(2004)1182 — C6-0013/2005 — 2004/2040(DEC)) The European Parliament, - having regard to the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2003 [1], - having regard to the final annual accounts of the European Communities — Financial year 2003 — Volume I — Consolidated reports on implementation of the budget and consolidated financial statements (SEC(2004)1181 — C6-0012/2005, SEC(2004)1182 — C6-0013/2005) [2], - having regard to the Commission's report on the follow-up to 2002 discharges (COM(2004)0648 — C6-0126/2004), - having regard to the Annual Report to the Discharge Authority on Internal Audits carried out in 2003 (COM(2004)0740), - having regard to the Court of Auditors' annual report for 2003 [3] and to its special reports accompanied by the replies of the institutions audited, - having regard to the Statement of Assurance concerning the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, provided by the Court of Auditors pursuant to Article 248 of the EC Treaty [4], - having regard to the Council recommendation of 8 March 2005 (C6-0077/2005), - having regard to Articles 274, 275 and 276 of the EC Treaty and Articles 179a and 180b of the Euratom Treaty, - having regard to Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities [5], in particular Articles 145, 146 and 147 thereof, - having regard to the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities [6], - having regard to Rule 70 of and Annex V to its Rules of Procedure, - having regard to the report of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the opinions of the other committees concerned (A6-0070/2005), A.
whereas the Commission has the right of initiative according to the Treaty, and whereas ultimate financial responsibility for implementation of the budget is indivisible and lies — with due consideration to the subsidiarity principle as adopted with Treaty of Maastricht — with the Commission, as laid down by Article 274 of the Treaty, and accordingly the appropriate checks on Community funds must be laid down, E.
HORIZONTAL ISSUES 1.
Welcomes the fact that the introduction of the rule n + 2 (year of commitment + 2) has largely contributed to solving this problem, such that for the last two years there has been an absorption of more than 99 % of the structural funds; 3.
Takes the view that these problems cannot only be resolved by centrally imposed controls, and that the current situation clearly demonstrates the need for new instruments to enhance the Commission's insight into the Member States' management and control systems; considers that only sufficiently comprehensive ex-ante disclosure in a formal Disclosure Statement and an annual ex-post Declaration of Assurance as regards the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions from each Member State's highest political and managing authority (Finance Minister), as suggested several times by the Commission's Internal Audit Service [10], will enable the Commission to fulfil its obligations under Article 274 of the Treaty; 22.
Considers it inappropriate to decide the appropriations for shared management policy for the period after 2007 without giving a concrete answer to the remarks of the Court of Auditors and substantially improving the control mechanisms in the Member States; 25.
Takes the view that progress in the European Union's financial management is not possible without Member States' active participation, and that this "participation" must be anchored at political level; 27.
Notes that the central question in the context of the DAS should be whether the supervisory systems and controls that have been implemented at Community and national level provide the Commission with a reasonable assurance as regards the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions; 36.
Invites the Court to explain in detail the degree to which it has been able to obtain audit results from "other auditors" and the role which these results have played in the Court's judgement; notes the absence of references to results from other auditors in the Annual Report; would in particular appreciate information on results and difficulties as regards co-operation with "other auditors" in the different Member States, as these "other auditors" also include national audit institutions which enjoy complete autonomy vis-à-vis the European institutions; 40.
Stresses that although compensatory controls are an important element of supervisory systems and controls, they cannot compensate for deficiencies in supervisory systems and controls or — indeed — in policy formulation as such; 43.
Notes, however, that the Court of Auditors found (see paragraph 1.69, table 1.2, paragraphs 5.57-5.62, 7.48, 8.36 and 8.38) that "the extent of the reservations expressed by some departments is not compatible or sufficiently justified in view of the assurance provided in the declarations" and that in spite of some improvement, "the annual activity reports and declarations of the Directors-General cannot yet systematically serve as a useful basis for its audit conclusions in the various areas of the financial perspectives" (see paragraph 1.71 and table 1.2); 60.
Invites the Commission to produce estimates of error rates by sector and Member State, using the findings of the audit work it already carries out and the control work carried out by the Member States, as well as an analysis of the quality of the information presented by Member States, and to publish the results in the annual activity reports and the synthesis of annual activity reports in such a way as to provide a clear view of the quality of Member States' administrative systems as regards EU accountability; 66.
Invites the Court of Auditors to organise each year a number of "benchmark audits" of items of delegated expenditure, to be published in special reports, in which - all 25 Member States are audited for the same programme or activity, - the results are published for each Member State openly and transparently so that comparisons can be made, and invites the Court to organise follow-up audits at subsequent points in the future so that progress can be monitored; 75.
Further considers that it could be necessary to analyse whether the current structure and functioning of the "top heavy" Court of Auditors should be reformed; recalls that the Court of Auditors currently has 25 Members and 736 employees, of whom 325 are professional auditors (A and B grades), with 275 (A and B grades) working in the audit groups and 50 (A grades) in Members' cabinets; 79.
Notes that the Commission will by March 2005 have reviewed all of the approximately 4000 cases of irregularities (442 substantial cases and 3500 smaller cases) which occurred during the reference period; 86.
Points out that research into alternative crops has been neglected and that producers have not been encouraged to shift to other economic activities; the Community Tobacco Fund, which is financed by a levy on the tobacco subsidy and managed by both DG AGRI (50 %) and DG SANCO (50 %), has been underutilised, most of the unused EUR 68 million being attributable to the DG SANCO information campaigns; from 2006, no measures to promote a switch of production are funded; asks for a more consistent approach; 105.
States that, since farmers face the prospect of payments to them being reduced or excluded in the event of non-compliance, it is essential that they be made aware in advance of their new obligations as regards cross-compliance with environmental standards after the 2006 reform; asks the Commission and Member States to fulfil their duty to precisely define these criteria in good time before the reform comes into force, in order to enable farmers to bring their activities into line with the new rules; 107.
Is satisfied, in general, at the high degree of utilisation of appropriations for the budget headings coming under DG Health and Consumer Protection, the proportion of 2003 budget funding used having been 99,3 %; 132.
Notes that despite this high rate of payment appropriation utilisation the volume of outstanding commitments or RAL ("reste à liquider") was not reduced and rose slightly to EUR 1154 million for TEN-T in the course of 2003; 138.
Welcomes the fact that some progress has been made in the implementation of the budget for an area of freedom, security and justice (budget title B5-8) in comparison with the 2002 budget year; notes, however, that the level of execution in particular of payments is one of the lowest of the Commission (68 % in 2003; 79 % for the entire internal policies) while the level of execution of commitments now reaches the average of the internal policies; calls on the Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security to continue to improve implementation of the budget in the forthcoming financial years; 144.
Notes with concern and regret the remarks made by the Court of Auditors in its annual report 2003 about the implementation of the Refugee Fund; in view of the restructuring of the expenditure programmes in this policy area in the context of the new financial perspective, which will lead to more shared management, requests the Commission to ensure an adequate control environment at national and European level; 146.
Expresses its concern that the Commission has not yet given its opinion on the draft financial regulation of Eurojust, as required by the Eurojust decision, although it was sent to the Commission by Eurojust in November 2003; Gender equality 147.
Agrees with the Commission's political priorities for the 2003 budget inasmuch as enlargement and the administration's preparations for this process should be considered absolute EU priorities; points out the importance it has attached, in light of the objectives of the Lisbon and Barcelona summits, to the need for an increased rate of participation by women in the enlarged EU labour market, in order, particularly, to promote the socio-economic status of women in the new Member States, and also to the need to establish the necessary financial resources when planning the budget; 148.
Welcomes the significant progress achieved in the implementation of the 2003 budget with regard to all the objectives and also the programming period for the Structural Funds, which translates into a payments implementation rate of 89 %, well above that achieved in 2002 (71 %); draws attention as a priority to the total absence of data relating to activities promoting gender equality that have received Structural Fund support and calls on the Commission to remedy this situation at the earliest opportunity; 150.
Notes that, while the 2003 Activity Report by DG Relex speaks of a need for further evaluation of the deconcentration, it would appear that this evaluation would only concern staffing needs; draws attention particularly, therefore, to the Council's invitation to the Commission "to conduct a qualitative assessment of EC External Assistance separate to the Annual Report" and to present this before July 2005; 153.
Draws attention to the continued absence of proper information management systems and a system of supervision of the work of the Delegations regarding the evaluation of financial risks, a situation recognised by DG Relex itself in its Annual Activity Report of 2003 and attributed to a shortage of human resources; points out that, while the Commission's candour and its proposals to remedy the situation are to be welcomed, these must be implemented sooner rather than later, and calls on the Commission to issue an interim report on its progress before July 2005; 154.
Is concerned that, in its audit of implementing organisations at project level, the Court of Auditors found a significant number of irregular transactions (paragraphs 7.38 and 7.39 of the annual report); notes that, in its reply, the Commission agrees with the Court of Auditors that the observance of tender and procurement procedures by project management units and NGOs remains an area of concern; expects the Members of the Commission with responsibility for external aid to submit an action plan by 1 September 2005 in order to bring those problems under control; 155.
Recognises the Commission's efforts to focus its development operations on the achievement of the MDGs including the identification of ten key indicators; calls on the Commission to step up its efforts in this direction and recommends devoting 35 % of the European Union's development cooperation expenditure to achieving the MDGs; 163.
Welcomes the improvements made by the Commission in its reporting system and recognises the improved quality of the Annual Report 2004 on EC Development Policy and External Assistance (COM(2004)0536 and SEC(2004)1027); 165.
Welcomes the fact that the share of spending for social infrastructure and services of the Official Development Assistance (ODA) financed by the general budget and the EDF, which totalled EUR 8269 million in 2003, increased from 31,4% in 2002 to 34,7 % in 2003; 167.
Commends the Commission for the efforts it has made so far through the PHARE programme in helping to prepare the candidate countries for managing the structural funds; 171.
Is nevertheless concerned by the failure to ensure that the accreditation process for many PHARE and ISPA agencies in the new Member States was completed before accession; urges the Commission, however, to endeavour to ensure that such a failure does not occur in relation to Romania, Bulgaria and the future acceding countries; 172.
Concludes that the aims and objectives of Sapard, as the first pre-accession aid to be fully decentralised, were excellent, even if it did not fully achieve them; acknowledges the benefit of the Sapard programme, which not only stimulated economic development in candidate countries but also encouraged people to think in a new way which was more rational and project-based; acknowledges that the programme was beneficial in terms of learning by doing, in that it provided national administrative authorities in the accession states with direct experience in the management of Community funds; considers that the overall experience gained with this programme will definitely be of added value in the implementation of future Community programmes; urges the Commission to improve its ex-ante analysis of needs, so as to further increase added value; 175.
Commends the Commission for the efforts made through the specific financial assistance in the preaccession strategy for Malta and Cyprus in helping these two countries prepare for membership; regrets, however, that both Malta and Cyprus were excluded from the main pre-accession financial instruments, PHARE, Sapard and ISPA, and therefore had more limited opportunities to prepare for managing Community Funds.
