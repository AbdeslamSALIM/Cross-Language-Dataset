EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
Structuring its proposals around three general and policy-led programmes (“Solidarity and management of migration flows”, “Fundamental Rights and Justice”, “Security and safeguarding freedoms”), the Commission sets out a clear framework for the development of financial interventions of the Community in support of the three objectives of Justice, Freedom and Security. 2.
A comprehensive, multidisciplinary and integrated strategy has been put forward since 1990 at European level, but without a clearly identified means of financial support.
This strategy is based on five main elements: (i) reducing demand, (ii) reducing supply and combating illicit trafficking, (iii) international co-operation, (iv) co-ordination at national and EU level and (v) information research and evaluation. 2.2.
To raise awareness of the health and social problems caused by drug use and to encourage an open dialogue with a view to promoting a better understanding of the drug phenomenon. | All the objectives are consistent with the overall aim of the general programme “Fundamental Rights and Justice” to support the development of an area of freedom, security and justice. - Complementarity/coherence with other instruments When preparing the programme, particular attention was given to ensure coherence with other programmes financing activities in the same policy areas and to looking for complementarity and synergy with these.
The general programmes “Security and Safeguarding Liberties” and “Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows” will be given special attention as they complement the present programme and synergy with the two will certainly be achieved in particular in the area of fighting against crime be it violence such as racially-motivated violence and violence related to gender or sexual preference or drugs related crimes.
A mid term report was presented in 2002[13] and a final report in 2004[14].
Legal Basis This specific programme of the general programme “Fundamental Rights and Justice” is based in Article 152 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Article 152 TEC, which relates to public health, clearly states that the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities shall ensure a high level of protection of human health.
The legal basis proposed is therefore adequate. 4.2.
Subsidiarity and Proportionality The current proposal has been designed to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty and its accompanying Protocol.
As far as proportionality is concerned, the new programme proposal has been designed to incorporate the maximum possible simplification in terms not only of the form of the action – the definitions of actions in the legislative text are kept as generic as possible – but also in terms of the administrative and financial requirements that will apply to their implementation.
These agencies shall be designated by the Commission in conformity with the provisions of Articles 55 and 56 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and of Article 37 of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002.
The proposed new instrument follows the path that was determined by the Commission in what concerns the political and financial challenges as from 2007 on.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The cost of the general programme “Fundamental Rights and Justice” for the period 2007–2013 is EUR 543 million; the present specific programme will be allocated EUR 138.2 million. 2005/0037 (COD) Proposal for a DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL Establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme "Fight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and information" as part of the General programme "Fundamental Rights and Justice" THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 152 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[17], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[18], Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[19], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[20], Whereas: (1) The Treaty establishing the European Community establishes that in the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities a high level of human health has to be ensured; Article 3(1)(p) of the Treaty requires Community action to include a contribution to the attainment of a high level of health protection. (2) Community action should complement national policies directed towards improving public health, obviating sources of danger to human health and reducing health-related harm associated with drug dependence. (3) Physical, sexual and psychological violence against children, young people and women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life, constitute a breach of their right to life, safety, freedom, dignity and physical and emotional integrity and a serious threat to the physical and mental health of the victims of such violence.
In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (22) Appropriate measures should also be taken to prevent irregularities and fraud and the necessary steps should be taken to recover funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used. (23) This Decision establishes a financial framework for the entire duration of the programme, which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure[29].

(25) The Financial Regulation requires a basic act to be provided to cover operating grants. (26) In accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[32] measures for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted by use of the advisory procedure provided for in Article 3 of that Decision.

The general programmes “Security and Safeguarding Liberties” and “Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows” will be given special attention as they complement the present programme and synergy will certainly be achieved.
LEGAL BASIS AND RATIONALE OF THE POLICY INSTRUMENT 4.1.
Legal Basis This specific programme of the general programme “Fundamental Rights and Justice” is based in Article 308 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Subsidiarity and Proportionality The current proposal has been designed to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty and its accompanying Protocol.
So far as proportionality is concerned, the new programme proposal has been designed to incorporate the maximum possible simplification in terms not only of the form of the action – the definitions of actions in the legislative text are kept as generic as possible – but also in terms of the administrative and financial requirements that will apply to their implementation.
These agencies shall be designated by the Commission in conformity with the provisions of Articles 55 and 56 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and of Article 37 of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002.
The proposed new instrument follows the path that was determined by the Commission in what concerns the political and financial challenges as from 2007 on.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS The cost of the general programme “Fundamental Rights and Justice” for the period 2007–2013 is EUR 5439 million; the present specific programme will be allocated EUR 96.5 million. 2005/0038 (CNS) Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION Establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme "Fundamental rights and citizenship" as part of the General programme "Fundamental Rights and Justice" THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[35], Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament[36], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[37], Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[38], Whereas: (1) Article 6(1) on the Treaty on European Union states that the Union is founded on the principle of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States. (2) Article 6(2) on the Treaty on European Union states that the Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, as general principles of Community law. (3) The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which was proclaimed on 7 December 2000, embraces the fundamental values on which the European Union is founded[39]. (4) As stated in The Hague Programme adopted by the European Council at its meeting in Brussels on 4 and 5 November 2004, the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and the accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will place the European Union under a legal obligation to ensure, subject to respect of the principle of subsidiarity, that in all areas of its activity, fundamental rights are not only respected but also actively promoted. (5) In its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union[40], the Commission underlines the importance of the role that civil society plays both in protecting and promoting fundamental rights; the Commission therefore should establish a regular dialogue with civil society. (6) The Commission stresses the importance of the information and communication with respect to the rights that European Union citizenship confers on its citizens to improve their awareness of their rights and to provide them with easy access to reliable information. (7) In November 2004 the European Council recognised the importance of communication to bring all persons close to the European project by encouraging an active citizenship. (8) The Association of the Council of States and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union promotes exchanges of views and experience on matters concerning the jurisprudence, organisation and functioning of its Members in the performance of their judicial and/or advisory functions, particularly with regard to Community Law and therefore pursues an aim of general European interest. (9) The Treaty does not provide, for the adoption of this Decision, powers than those under Article 308. (10) Appropriate measures should also be taken to prevent irregularities and fraud and the necessary steps should be taken to recover funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used. (11) This Decision establishes a financial framework for the entire duration of the programme, which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure[41]. (12) The objectives of the programme, namely in the field of promotion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights including those derived from the EU citizenship , the support to civil society associations, the fight against racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism through an interfaith and multicultural dialogue cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or impact of the initiative, be better achieved at Community level.
The Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.

(14) The Financial Regulation requires a basic act to be provided to cover operating grants. (15) In accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[44] measures for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted by use of the advisory procedure provided for in Article 3 of that Decision.
The programme shall cover the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.
Article 2 General objectives 1.

(2) According to Article 31 of the Treaty of the European Union, common action in criminal matters shall include, in particular, cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States. (3) Building on the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, The Hague Programme, adopted by the European Council in November 2004, reaffirms the priority in strengthening Freedom, Security and Justice in the European Union, in particular by enhancing judicial cooperation in criminal matters, based on the mutual recognition principle. (4) The framework programme on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (AGIS) established by Council Framework Decision 2002/630/JHA of 22 July 2002[49] contributed considerably to strengthening cooperation between police and other law enforcement agencies and the judiciary in the Member States and to improving mutual understanding and mutual trust of their police, judicial, legal and administrative systems. (5) The ambitious objectives set by the Treaty and The Hague Programme should be realised through the establishment of a flexible and effective programme that will facilitate planning and implementation. (6) The programme should improve mutual confidence within the judiciary.
This contributes to strengthening the mutual confidence and improves mutual understanding among judicial authorities and different legal systems. (8) Appropriate measures should also be taken to prevent irregularities and fraud and the necessary steps should be taken to recover funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used. (9) This Decision establishes a financial framework for the entire duration of the programme, which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure[50]. (10) Since the objectives of the Criminal Justice Programme cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the initiative, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (11) Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[51], hereinafter “the Financial Regulation”, and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002[52], which safeguard the Community’s financial interests, have to be applied taking into account the principles of simplicity and consistency in the choice of budgetary instruments, a limitation on the number of cases where the Commission retains direct responsibility for their implementation and management, and the required proportionality between the amount of resources and the administrative burden related to their use. (12) The Financial Regulation requires a basic act to be provided to cover operating grants. (13) The measures required to implement this Decision should be adopted according to the procedures laid down in it, with the assistance of an advisory committee.
This is appropriate since the programme does not have a significant impact on the budget of the European Union. (14) It is appropriate to replace the framework programme on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (AGIS) by this programme from 1 January 2007 and by the new specific programme “Prevention of and fight against crime” from the general programme “Security and Safeguarding Liberties”.
The programme shall cover the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.
