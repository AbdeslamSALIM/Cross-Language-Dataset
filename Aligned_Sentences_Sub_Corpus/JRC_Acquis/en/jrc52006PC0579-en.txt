Proposal for a Council Decision Providing Community macro-financial assistance to Moldova {SEC(2006) 1258} /* COM/2006/0579 final - CNS 2006/0184 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 9.10.2006 COM(2006) 579 final 2006/0184 (CNS) Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION Providing Community macro-financial assistance to Moldova (presented by the Commission) {SEC(2006) 1258} EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The Commission proposes to provide macro-financial assistance to Moldova in the form of a grant of a maximum amount of EUR 45 million with a view to supporting Moldova's balance of payments and the reserve build-up.
The proposed assistance will help Moldova alleviate the financial constraints on the implementation of its economic programme.
The proposed macro-financial assistance will be exceptional and limited in time, will complement support from the Bretton Woods Institutions, bilateral donors and the Paris Club, and will be conditional, in particular, on progress in the implementation of the IMF-supported PRGF arrangement.
Two EU macro-financial assistance operations for Moldova – a loan of EUR 15 million decided in 2000 and a grant of the same amount decided in 2002[1]– could therefore not be implemented.
By 2005, Moldova's GDP per capita had more than doubled (in dollar terms) compared to its level in 2000.
By the time of the adoption of the programme, it was assumed that the contemplated policies would translate into GDP growth of 6% in 2006 and 5% in 2007-2008, a gradual reduction of inflation to about 7% by end-2008 and current account deficits in the neighbourhood of 5% of GDP.
EU MFA would contribute to meeting Moldova's external financing requirements in 2007 and 2008.
Moldova is one of the EU partner countries in this context since the ENP was launched in 2004.
Following the adoption of the Council Decision, the Commission services will negotiate with the authorities of Moldova a Memorandum of Understanding and the grant agreement to lay down in detail the implementation modalities of the assistance. | Collection and use of expertise | 229 | There was no need for external expertise. | 230 | Impact assessment Because macro-financial assistance is a policy-based instrument, it is particularly well-suited to support the efforts of the authorities of Moldova to improve the fiscal sustainability in the short-to-medium run.
Macro-financial assistance will have an immediate impact on Moldova's balance of payments and reserves and will in this way contribute to the alleviation of financial constraints on the implementation of the authorities' economic programme.
EC assistance will also help the authorities implement short- and medium-term policies identified in the EU-Moldova European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan and the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. | LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | 305 | Summary of the proposed action The Community shall make available to Moldova macro-financial assistance in the form of grants of a maximum amount of EUR 45 million.
