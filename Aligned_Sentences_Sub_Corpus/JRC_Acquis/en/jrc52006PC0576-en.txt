Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Community energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment (Recast) /* COM/2006/0576 final - COD 2006/0187 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 4.10.2006 COM(2006) 576 final 2006/0187 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on a Community energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment (Recast) (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Purpose of the proposal Based on an Agreement with the Government of the United States of America on the coordination of energy-efficiency labelling programmes for office equipment, Regulation (EC) 2422/2001 lays down the rules for implementing the Energy Star programme for office equipment (computers, computer monitors, printers, copiers, scanners, fax machines) in the Community.
The proposals on the new Agreement and to recast Regulation (EC) 2422/2001 take into account the experience gained during the first period of implementation of the Energy Star programme in the Community, from 2001 to 2006, and of the consultations of the European Community Energy Star Board.
Reasons for continuing the Energy Star programme The detailed reasons for continuing the Energy Star programme for a second period of five years are set out in the Communication on the implementation of the Energy Star programme in the period 2001-2005[1] and in the Recommendation from the Commission to the Council to open negotiations on the second Energy Star Agreement[2].
The Energy Star programme owned by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and managed by the European Commission for the EC and for the EEA is therefore the natural platform for measures aiming at improving the energy efficiency of office equipment through labelling. - The voluntary Energy Star programme is widely accepted by manufacturers.
THE NEW ENERGY STAR AGREEMENT The first Agreement with the United States expired in June 2006.
The European Parliament was informed of the negotiations on the new Energy Star Agreement at the meeting of the Industry, Research and Energy Committee on 30 May 2006.
Article 8: European Community Energy Star Board (ECESB) The proposal is to abolish the obligation for the ECESB to produce a report on the market penetration of Energy Star products and on the technology available.
Article 13 of Regulation (EC) 2422/2001: Implementation This Article is repealed because no duties that should be reported upon are placed on the Member States.
Article 14 of Regulation (EC) 2422/2001 - Article 13 of the recast version: Revision This Article has been reworded to lighten the burden of programme implementation on the Commission and to make it consistent with the voluntary nature of the Energy Star scheme.
This should help to make the Community legislation more accessible and transparent. 2422/2001 (adapted) 2006/0187 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on a Community energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment (Recast) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[5], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[6], After consulting Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[7], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[8], Whereas: ò new (1) A number of substantial changes are to be made to Regulation (EC) No 2422/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001[9].
The most effective measure for reducing electrical consumption of office equipment is to reduce the standby consumption in accordance with the Council conclusions of May 1999 on standby losses of consumer electronic equipment.
In order to achieve this objective, stronger measures are required to reduce CO2 carbon dioxide emissions within the Community. 2422/2001 recital (10) (8) Furthermore, Decision No 2179/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 1998 on the review of the European Community programme of policy and action in relation to the environment and sustainable development "Towards sustainability"[11] indicated as a key priority for the integration of environmental requirements in relation to energy the provision of energy efficiency labelling of appliances. 2422/2001 recital (11) (9) The Council Resolution of 7 December 1998 on energy efficiency in the European Community[12] called for the increased use of labelling of appliances and equipment. 2422/2001 recital (12) (10) It is desirable to coordinate energy-efficiency requirements, labels and test methods wherever appropriate. 2422/2001 recital (13) (11) Most energy-efficient office equipment is available at little or no extra cost and may therefore in many cases pay for any additional cost through electricity savings within a reasonably short time.
However, regular reviews must be carried out by the Commission to ascertain whether the technical criteria set are ambitious enough and take sufficient account of the Community's concerns ð When setting the technical criteria together with the US Environmental Protection Agency the Commission should aim at ambitious levels of energy efficiency ï . 2422/2001 recital (16) (adapted) (14) An effective enforcement system is necessary to ensure that the energy-efficient energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment is implemented properly, guarantees fair conditions of competition for producers and protects consumer rights. 2422/2001 recital (17) (adapted) (15) This Regulation is confined will apply only to office equipment products. 2422/2001 recital (18) (16) Council Directive 92/75/EEC of 22 September 1992 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by household appliances[14] is not the most appropriate instrument for office equipment.
It is necessary to ensure that the Energy Star and ecodesign schemes are consistent and coordinated. 2422/2001 recital (21) (adapted) (20) It is desirable to coordinate the Community Energy Star programme based on the Agreement of […] 2006 and other voluntary labelling energy labelling schemes for office equipment in the Community in order to prevent confusion for consumers and potential market distortions. 2422/2001 recital (22) (adapted) (21) It is necessary to guarantee transparency in the implementation of the Energy Star scheme and to ensure consistency with relevant international standards in order to facilitate access to, and participation in, the scheme for manufacturers and exporters from countries outside the Community,. ò new (22) This Regulation takes into account the experience gained during the initial period of implementation of the Energy Star programme in the Community, 2422/2001 HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Objectives 2422/2001 (adapted) This Regulation establishes the rules for the Community energy-efficiency labelling programme for office equipment (hereinafter referred to as “the Energy Star programme”) as defined in the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the European Community on the coordination of energy-efficient energy-efficiency labelling programmes for office equipment (hereinafter referred to as “the Agreement”).
Participation in the Energy Star programme is on a voluntary basis. 2422/2001 Article 2 Scope This Regulation shall apply to the office equipment product groups defined in Annex C of to the Agreement, subject to any amendments thereof in accordance with Article X of the Agreement.
