PROVISIONAL MEASURES (1) The Commission, by Regulation (EC) No 358/2002(2) (the %quot%provisional Regulation%quot%), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain tube and pipe fittings (TPFs), of iron or steel, falling within CN codes ex 7307 93 11, ex 7307 93 19, ex 7307 99 30 and ex 7307 99 90, originating in the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Russia, the Republic of Korea and Slovakia. (2) It is recalled that the investigation period of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2001 (%quot%IP%quot%).
The examination of trends relevant for the injury analysis covered the period from 1 January 1996 to 31 March 2001 (%quot%period under consideration%quot%).
PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT (7) In the absence of any comments, the product description and the definition of the like product as set out in recitals 9 to 12 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.
General methodology (8) In the absence of any comments, the general methodology for establishing the dumping margins as set out in recitals 15 to 28 of the provisional Regulation is confirmed. 2.
Dumping margins (9) In the absence of any comments, the determination of the normal value, the export price and the comparison for the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Slovakia and the determination of the market economy status and analogue country for Russia, as described in recitals 29 to 60 of the provisional Regulation, are confirmed. (10) The definitive dumping margins, expressed as a percentage of the CIF import price at the Community border, are confirmed as follows: %gt%TABLE%gt% E.
COMMUNITY INDUSTRY (11) In the absence of any comments, the provisional findings concerning the determination of the Community industry as described in recitals 61 to 62 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.
Community consumption (12) In the absence of any new information, the provisional findings concerning the Community consumption as described in recitals 63 to 64 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed. 2.
Moreover, all import volumes were substantial and resulting in significant market shares, which increased between 1996 and the IP, and were made at prices significantly undercutting the prices of the Community industry thus leading to a price depression of the Community industry's prices. (14) In the absence of any comments under these headings, the provisional findings as described in recitals 65 to 67 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.
The margin was therefore revised. (22) Taking the above into consideration, the definitive revised weighted average price undercutting margins found per country, expressed as a percentage of the Community industry prices, are as follows: - Czech Republic: from 19 % to 21 %, - Malaysia: from 52 % to 72 %, - Russia: 26 %, - Republic of Korea: 23 %, - Slovakia: from 15 % to 36 %. 3.
Most of the injury indicators showed a positive development between 1996 and 1998.
On the basis of the above and of the findings regarding productivity, investments, growth and magnitude of dumping, it was therefore concluded, at a provisional stage, that the Community industry suffered material injury. (24) In the absence of any comments, the facts and figures as set out in recitals 72 to 87 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed. 4.
Conclusion on injury (25) In the absence of any further comments on the findings other than those set out above, the conclusion reached as set out in recital 88 of the provisional Regulation is confirmed.
CAUSATION (26) In the absence of any new information submitted on causation, the findings and the conclusion reached as set out in recitals 89 to 97 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.
COMMUNITY INTEREST (27) In the absence of any new information submitted on the Community interest, the findings and the conclusion reached as set out in recitals 98 to 111 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.
DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES 1.
Injury elimination level (28) Based on the methodology explained in recitals 112 to 115 of the provisional Regulation an injury elimination level has been calculated for the purposes of establishing the level of measures to be definitively imposed. (29) One exporting producer questioned the level of the profit margin of 5 % that was used for the purpose of establishing the non-injurious price of the Community industry, claiming it was too high.
It also claimed that this level of profit margin was not sufficiently explained in the disclosed document. (30) As to the first claim, it is recalled that, in view of the negative impact on the profitability of the Community industry resulting from the price depressive effect caused by the dumped imports, as indicated in recital 71 of the provisional Regulation, the calculation of the non-injurious price was based on a level of profit that the Community industry might have reasonably achieved in the absence of injurious dumping.
As to the second claim, it should be noted that the Commission explained in sufficient detail in the disclosure document on which basis it calculated the level of profit margin used for the non-injurious price, as also explained in recital 114 of the provisional Regulation.
The claims have therefore to be rejected. (31) In addition, the same level of profit was also used for the establishment of the injury margin in the proceeding concerning the abovementioned countries, and there is no reason to believe that significant changes in circumstances have occurred since then. (32) The use of a profit margin of 5 % of turnover for the calculation of the non-injurious price is therefore confirmed. (33) On the basis of the above, the methodology used for establishing the injury elimination level as described in recitals 112 to 115 of the provisional Regulation is confirmed. (34) As mentioned above in relation to price undercutting margins, injury margins were reviewed and amended for one of the exporting producers in Slovakia. 2.
This price undertaking was accepted in the provisional Regulation. (40) Subsequent to the imposition of provisional anti-dumping measures, one exporting producer in the Czech Republic offered a price undertaking in accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation.
A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of tube and pipe fittings (other than cast fittings, flanges and threaded fittings), of iron or steel (not including stainless steel), with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609,6 mm, of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes, falling within CN codes ex 7307 93 11 (TARIC codes 7307 93 11*91 and 7307 93 11*99 ), ex 7307 93 19 (TARIC codes 7307 93 19*91 and 7307 93 19*99 ), ex 7307 99 30 (TARIC codes 7307 99 30*92 and 7307 99 30*98 ) and ex 7307 99 90 (TARIC codes 7307 99 90*92 and 7307 99 90*98 ) and originating in the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Russia, the Republic of Korea and Slovakia. 2.
Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the definitive anti-dumping duty shall not apply to imports released into free circulation in accordance with Article 2. 4.
Imports mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be exempt from the anti-dumping duty on condition that: (a) a commercial invoice containing at least the elements listed in the Annex is presented to Member States' customs authorities upon presentation of the declaration for release into free circulation; and (b) the goods declared and presented to customs correspond precisely to the description on the commercial invoice.
Article 3 Amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duties pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 358/2002 on imports of certain tube and pipe fittings, of iron or steel falling within CN codes ex 7307 93 11, ex 7307 93 19, ex 7307 99 30 and ex 7307 99 90 and originating in the Czech Republic, Malaysia, Russia, the Republic of Korea and Slovakia shall be definitively collected at the rate of the duty definitively imposed.
Article 4 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
