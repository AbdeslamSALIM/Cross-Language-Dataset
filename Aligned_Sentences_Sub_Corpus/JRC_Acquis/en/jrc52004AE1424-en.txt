Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the &amp;lsquo;Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of toluene and trichlorobenzene (twenty-eighth amendment of Council Directive 76/769/EEC)&amp;rsquo;(COM(2004) 320 final - 2004/0111 (COD)) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the "Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of toluene and trichlorobenzene (twenty-eighth amendment of Council Directive 76/769/EEC)" (COM(2004) 320 final - 2004/0111 (COD)) (2005/C 120/02) On 11 May 2004, the Council decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned proposal.
At its plenary session of 27 and 28 October 2004 (meeting of 27 October), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 165 votes to 1, with 5 abstentions: 1.
Substances placed on the market after 18 September 1981 are defined to be "new" and require pre-marketing notification under the relevant European Union legislation. 1.2 Risks to human health and the environment of these existing substances have been routinely assessed under Council Regulation (EEC) 793/93 [2].
The last of these was dated 25 October 2000 [3].
These identified 141 substances where some risk might be expected either due to their specific structures and known or anticipated biochemical interactions, or where their high production volumes (HPV) gave rise to concern. 1.3 Member States assess each substance at all stages of manufacture and use for both hazard and exposure to determine whether or nor there are indeed risks to health and the environment and if there are, what risk reduction measures might be required.
If the CSTEE agrees with the conclusions and supports the overall assessment process, risk reduction measures, if required, can be proposed as amendments to Annex 1 of the Council Directive on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations 76/769/EEC [4].
Both were included in the second list of priority substances published as Commission Regulation EC 2268/95 of 27 September 1995 [5].
The Commission published the proposal on 28 April 2004.
This will be from the date of entry into force of this proposal, after consulting, as required by Article 95 of the Treaty, the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) and following the Co-decision Procedure with the European Parliament. 3.
The CSTEE Opinion quotes EU production in 1995 at 2,6 million tonnes.
There is a clear need to minimise any unnecessary actual or theoretical uncontrolled exposure, in particular where alternative products, with similar solvating power, exist. 4.4 The two end uses specified in this proposal fall into this latter category.
Details of the listings are as follows [9]: EINECS Number | 201-757-1 | 204-428-0 | 203-686-6 | 234-413-4 | CAS Number | 87-61-6 | 120-82-1 | 108-70-3 | 12002-48-1 | Isomer | 1,2,3- | 1,2,4- | 1,3,5- | - | Form | White flakes | Clear liquid | White flakes | Clear liquid | Melting Point Â° C | 52-55 | 17 | 63-65 | - | Oral, rat LD50 mg/kg | 1830 | 756 | 800 | - | UN Number | 2811 | 2321 | 2811 | - | 5.3 The RAR and CSTEE Opinion refer specifically to 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene, with EINECS and CAS Numbers as above.
Sales are said to be restricted to the isomers 1,2,4-TCB and 1,2,3-TCB for use only as intermediates, with this being confirmed in pre-delivery written use statements from each customer. 5.7 A limited number of other closed system uses are known and recognised by the Commission and CSTEE, for instance as process solvents with no release to the external environment.
Brussels, 27 October 2004.
