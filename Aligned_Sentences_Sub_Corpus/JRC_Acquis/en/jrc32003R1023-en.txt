Existing measures (1) By Regulation (EC) No 1784/2000(2), the Council imposed in August 2000 an anti-dumping duty of 34,8 % on imports of threaded malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings (malleable fittings) originating in Brazil. 2.
It was made clear to the importers and exporters that non-cooperation may lead to the application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation. (8) A number of Community importers made their views known in writing declaring that they had not imported any malleable fittings from Argentina. (9) Replies to the questionnaires were received from one Argentinian exporting producer, DEMA SA, San Justo, Buenos Aires.
Investigation period (10) The investigation period covered the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 (the IP).
This Argentinian company accounted for a negligible part both in volume and in value of the total imports of malleable fittings from Argentina to the Community during the IP, as reported by Eurostat. (12) Furthermore, in the course of the investigation the Argentinian authorities requested within the time limits set in the initiating Regulation to be treated as an interested party.
Information and statistical data concerning Argentinian imports and exports were obtained from the Argentinian authorities. (13) In December 2002, one month after the expiry of the deadline for receipt of replies to the questionnaire, the Commission received a submission on behalf of Industrias Aguila Blanca SA (Argentina), who alleged to be a producer of malleable fittings in Argentina.
Non-cooperating Argentinian exporters (18) As far as the non-cooperating exporters are concerned the Commission had to establish the exports to the Community on the basis of facts available pursuant to Article 18 of the Basic Regulation.
At the same time, imports into the Community of malleable fittings from Argentina increased from 15 tonnes in 2000 to 3087 in 2001.
As a result, exports from Argentina decreased from 3087 tonnes in 2001 to 202 tonnes in 2002.
Undermining of the remedial effects of the duty in terms of the prices and/or quantities of the like products (non-cooperating Argentinian exporters) (24) It is evident from the figures in recital 19 that a clear quantitative change in the pattern of Community imports occurred since the imposition of measures.
This data revealed that the adjusted export prices from Argentina were around 5 % below the export prices of Brazilian exports in the original investigation.
Evidence of dumping in relation to the normal values previously established for like or similar products (non-cooperating Argentinian exporters) (27) In order to determine whether evidence of dumping could be found with respect to the malleable fittings exported to the Community from Argentina by the non-cooperating exporters during the IP, export data according to Eurostat at CN level were used pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
Approach based on export data reported by Eurostat (28) In accordance with Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, the normal value to be used in an anti-circumvention investigation is the normal value established during the original investigation. (29) In the original investigation, normal value for Brazil was determined per type of malleable fitting.
Consequently, a weighted average normal value per tonne based on a product mix equal to the product mix in the original investigation was established. (30) For the purpose of a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences which affect prices and price comparability.
REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION OR EXTENSION OF THE DUTY (32) The Commission received requests for exemption from the registration and measures from two Argentinian producers, Industrias Aguila Blanca SA and DEMA SA.
