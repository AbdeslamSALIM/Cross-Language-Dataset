Article 10 Calculation of en route charges 1.
Without prejudice to the implementation by a Member State of an incentive scheme with regard to air navigation service providers in accordance with Article 12(2), the unit rate in the en route charging zone shall be calculated by dividing the forecast number of chargeable en route service units for the relevant year into the forecast costs for air navigation services.
Article 11 Calculation of terminal charges 1.
Without prejudice to the possibility under Article 3 of financing terminal air navigation services through other sources of funding, the terminal charge for a specific flight in a specific terminal charging zone shall be equal to the product of the unit rate established for this terminal charging zone and the terminal service units for this flight. 2.
Without prejudice to the implementation by a Member State of an incentive scheme with regard to air navigation service providers in accordance with Article 12(2), the unit rate in the terminal charging zone shall be calculated by dividing the forecast number of chargeable terminal service units for the relevant year into the forecast costs for air navigation services.
Article 12 Incentive schemes 1.
Member States may establish or approve incentive schemes consisting of financial advantages or disadvantages applied on a non-discriminatory and transparent basis to support improvements in the provision of air navigation services resulting in a different calculation of charges as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3.
