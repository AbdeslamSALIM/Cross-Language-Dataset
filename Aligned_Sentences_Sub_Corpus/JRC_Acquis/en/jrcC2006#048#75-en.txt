Pleas in law and main arguments In Case T-63/02, brought by the same applicants, staff of the European Central Bank (ECB), the Court of First Instance annulled the decisions contained in the salary statements sent on 13 July 2001 to the applicants, for July 2001, as the ECB did not consult the Staff Committee at the time of the adoption of the salary adjustment for 2001.
In consequence of that judgment, the ECB consulted the Staff Committee concerning the salary adjustments for the period 2001-2003, and a salary increase for all staff from 1 July 2004.
The applicants claim first of all that, by refusing to apply to them retrospectively from July 2001 the correction linked to the salary adjustment for 2001, the ECB infringed Article 233 EC, and the principle of res judicata with regard to the judgment given on 20 November 2003 in Case T-63/02.
Moreover, they claim the infringement of Articles 45 and 46 of the Conditions of Employment for Staff of the ECB, of the Memorandum of Understanding on relations between the ECB's managing bodies and the Staff Committee, of the principles of good administration and non-discrimination and of the obligation of good faith.
