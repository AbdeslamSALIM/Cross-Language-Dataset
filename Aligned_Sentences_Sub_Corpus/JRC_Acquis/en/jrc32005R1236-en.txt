In view of this, the Community resolved in 1995 to make respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms an essential element of its relations with third countries.
It was decided to insert a clause to that end in any new trade, cooperation and association agreement of a general nature that it concludes with third countries. (2) Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms all lay down an unconditional, comprehensive prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Other provisions, in particular the United Nations Declaration Against Torture [1] and the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, place an obligation on States to prevent torture. (3) Article 2(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union [2] states that no one shall be condemned to the death penalty or executed.
On 29 June 1998, the Council approved "Guidelines on EU policy towards third countries on the death penalty" and resolved that the European Union would work towards the universal abolition of the death penalty. (4) Article 4 of the said Charter states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
On 9 April 2001, the Council approved "Guidelines to the EU policy toward third countries, on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment".
Therefore and in line with these texts, capital punishment is not to be considered a lawful penalty under any circumstances. (5) In its Resolution on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted on 25 April 2001 and supported by the EU Member States, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights called upon United Nations Members to take appropriate steps, including legislative measures, to prevent and prohibit, inter alia, the export of equipment which is specifically designed to inflict torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
This point was confirmed by Resolutions adopted on 16 April 2002, 23 April 2003, 19 April 2004 and 19 April 2005. (6) On 3 October 2001, the European Parliament adopted a Resolution [3] on the Council's second Annual Report according to Operative Provision 8 of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, urging the Commission to act swiftly to bring forward an appropriate Community instrument banning the promotion, trade and export of police and security equipment the use of which is inherently cruel, inhuman or degrading, and to ensure that that Community instrument would suspend the transfer of police and security equipment the medical effects of which are not fully known, and of such equipment where its use in practice has revealed a substantial risk of abuse or unwarranted injury. (7) It is therefore appropriate to lay down Community rules on trade with third countries in goods which could be used for the purpose of capital punishment and in goods which could be used for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Such rules should ensure that Community economic operators do not derive any benefits from trade which either promotes or otherwise facilitates the implementation of policies on capital punishment or on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which are not compatible with the relevant EU Guidelines, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and international conventions and treaties. (8) For the purpose of this Regulation, it is considered appropriate to apply the definitions of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment laid down in the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and in Resolution 3452 (XXX) of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
These controls should apply to goods that are primarily used for law enforcement purposes and, unless such controls prove disproportionate, to any other equipment or product that could be abused for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, taking into account its design and technical features. (11) As regards law enforcement equipment, it should be noted that Article 3 of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials [4] provides that law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty.
Therefore, this Regulation should not apply to trade in traditional equipment for self-defence, such as shields. (14) This Regulation should also apply to trade in some specific chemical substances used to incapacitate persons. (15) As regards leg-irons, gang-chains and shackles and cuffs, it should be noted that Article 33 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners [5] provides that instruments of restraint shall never be applied as a punishment.
Member States should also be empowered to apply export controls on handcuffs having an overall dimension, including chain, exceeding 240 mm when locked, if they so wish. (17) This Regulation shall be construed as not affecting the existing rules on export of tear gases and riot control agents [6], of firearms, of chemical weapons and of toxic chemicals. (18) It is appropriate to provide for specific exemptions from the export controls in order not to impede the functioning of the police forces of the Member States and the execution of peace keeping or crisis management operations and, subject to review at a later stage, in order to allow transit of foreign goods. (19) The Guidelines to the EU Policy toward third countries on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment provide, inter alia, that the Heads of Mission in third countries will include in their periodic reports an analysis of the occurrence of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the State of their accreditation, and the measures taken to combat it.
CHAPTER II Goods which have no practical use other than for the purposes of capital punishment, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment Article 3 Export prohibition 1.
The supply of technical assistance related to goods listed in Annex II, whether for consideration or not, from the customs territory of the Community, to any person, entity or body in a third country shall be prohibited. 2.
By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the competent authority may authorise an export of goods listed in Annex II, and the supply of related technical assistance, if it is demonstrated that, in the country to which the goods will be exported, such goods will be used for the exclusive purpose of public display in a museum in view of their historic significance.
Article 4 Import prohibition 1.
By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the competent authority may authorise an import of goods listed in Annex II, and the supply of related technical assistance, if it is demonstrated that, in the Member State of destination, such goods will be used for the exclusive purpose of public display in a museum in view of its historic significance.
CHAPTER III Goods that could be used for the purpose of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment Article 5 Export authorisation requirement 1.

Paragraph 1 shall not apply to exports to those territories of Member States which are both listed in Annex IV and are not part of the customs territory of the Community, provided that the goods are used by an authority in charge of law enforcement in both the country or territory of destination and the metropolitan part of the Member State to which that territory belongs.
Customs or other relevant authorities shall have the right to verify whether this condition is met and may decide that, pending such verification, the export shall not take place. 3.
Paragraph 1 shall not apply to exports to third countries, provided that the goods are used by military or civil personnel of a Member State, if such personnel is taking part in an EU or UN peace keeping or crisis management operation in the third country concerned or in an operation based on agreements between Member States and third countries in the field of defence.
Article 6 Criteria for granting export authorisations 1.

Article 7 National measures 1.
Notwithstanding the provisions in Articles 5 and 6, a Member State may adopt or maintain a prohibition on the export and import of leg irons, gang chains and portable electric shock devices. 2.
A Member State may impose an authorisation requirement on the export of handcuffs which have an overall dimension including chains, measured from the outer edge of one cuff to the outer edge of the other cuff, exceeding 240 mm when locked.
The Member State concerned shall apply Chapter III and IV to such handcuffs. 3.
Member States shall notify the Commission of any measures adopted pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2.

Article 11 Notification and consultation requirement 1.
The competent authority shall consult the authority or authorities which, in the preceding three years, dismissed an application for authorisation of an import or export or the supply of technical assistance under this Regulation, if it receives an application concerning an import or export or the supply of technical assistance involving an essentially identical transaction referred to in such earlier application and considers that an authorisation should, nevertheless, be granted. 3.
CHAPTER V General and final provisions Article 12 Amendment of Annexes 1.
The Commission shall be empowered to amend Annex I.
