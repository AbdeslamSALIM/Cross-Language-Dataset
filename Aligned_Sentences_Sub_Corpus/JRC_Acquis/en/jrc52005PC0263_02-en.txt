Proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers {SEC(2005) 808} /* COM/2005/0263 final - CNS 2005/0119 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 22.6.2005 COM(2005) 263 final 2005/0118 (CNS) 2005/0119 (CNS) 2005/0120 (CNS) Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the European Community and amending Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (presented by the Commission) {SEC(2005) 808} EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
The scheme will provide: - a high, degressive per-tonne restructuring aid, available to EU sugar factories, isoglucose and inulin syrup producers, which will be granted for factory closure and renunciation of the quota; - a top-up payment, to ensure sugar beet growers the possibility of receiving the full, final direct payment, as from the first marketing year, in the event that they abandon production, owing to the fact that the factory, with which they have sugar beet delivery rights, has closed under the restructuring scheme.
In order to maintain a certain production level in current “C” sugar producing Member States, the Commission proposes that: - an additional amount of 1 million tonnes of quota shall be made available to those Member States; - at the time of allocation of that quota to sugar producers, a one-off, per-tonne amount will be charged, equal to the level of the year 1 restructuring aid.
In addition to the ongoing dialogue with Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) for Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Serbia-Montenegro has been introduced[8], as from 1 July 2005.
In order to ease the implementation of the price cuts, it is proposed to change the start date of the sugar campaign from 1 July to 1 October, starting in the 2007/08 campaign.
Minimum Sugar Beet Price The minimum price for sugar beet has been calculated, in line with the proposed reference price cuts, net of the restructuring amount.
At the time of allocation of that quota to sugar producers, a one-off, per-tonne amount will be charged, equal to the level of the year 1 restructuring aid.
The restructuring amount will be set at € 126.40/t in 2006/07, € 91.00/t in 2007/08 and € 64.50/t in 2008/09.
In order to encourage an early uptake of the scheme, sugar factories closing as from 1 July 2005 will be eligible for the restructuring aid.
The amount of EUR 4 225 million will be charged over three marketing years (2006/07 up to 2008/09) and the restructuring aid will be available for four marketing years (2006/07 to 2009/10).

The measures introduced by that Regulation include a significant reduction in the institutional support price for Community sugar in two steps. (2) As a consequence of reduced market support in the sugar sector, income support measures for sugar beet growers should be introduced.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003[16] introduced those elements for a variety of agricultural products. (4) In order to meet the objectives underlying the reform of the common agricultural policy, the support for sugar beet should be de-coupled and integrated into the single payment scheme. (5) Consequently, the rules on direct support schemes laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should be adapted. (6) Sugar beet and chicory growers in the new Member States have benefited since accession from price support in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector[17].
Therefore, the sugar payment and the sugar and chicory components in the single payment scheme should not be subject to the application of the schedule of increments provided for in Article 143a. (7) The level of individual income support should be calculated on the basis of the average number of hectares under sugar beet or chicory used for the production of A and B sugar or inuline syrup covered by a delivery contract concluded, in accordance with Article 19 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, with a sugar or inuline syrup undertaking for one or more marketing years to be determined by Member States. (8) To ensure the proper application of the support scheme and for reasons of budget control, provision should be made for keeping the overall income support within the limit of national envelopes calculated on the basis of a historical reference year. (9) Member States that have opted or will opt for applying the single payment scheme only as from 1 January 2007 should be enabled to grant income support to growers of sugar beet and chicory used for the production of inuline syrup in 2006 in the form of a payment based on the number of hectares of sugar beet or chicory delivered.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
It shall apply as from 1 January 2006.
