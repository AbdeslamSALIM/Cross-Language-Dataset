Article 2 No Member State may refuse to grant EEC type-approval or national type-approval of a vehicle on grounds relating to the external projections if such projections satisfy the requirements laid down in Annexes I and II.
Article 3 No Member State may refuse to register or prohibit the sale, entry into service or use of any vehicle on grounds relating to the external projections if such projections satisfy the requirements laid down in Annexes I and II.
Article 5 Modifications which are necessary to adapt the provisions of Annexes I, II and III to take account of technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Directive No 70/156/EEC.
They shall apply these provisions from 1 October 1975. 2.
Article 7 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Done at Brussels, 17 September 1974.
EEC TYPE-APPROVAL (4.1.) (4.2.) (4.3.) (4.4.) (4.4.1.) (4.4.2.) (4.5.) 4.6.
GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS 5.1.
Ornaments 6.1.1.
Added ornaments which project more than 10 mm from their support shall retract, become detached or bend over under a force of 10 daN exerted at their most salient point in any direction in a plane approximately parallel to the surface on which they are mounted.
Projecting visors and rims shall be permitted on headlights, provided that their projection, as measured in relation to the external transparent surface of the headlight does not exceed 30 mm and their radius of curvature is at least 2.5 mm throughout. 6.2.2.
For gaps of between 40 mm and 25 mm the radii of curvature shall be of 1 mm or more.
Windscreen wipers 6.4.1.
However, these units shall be so made as to have no sharp angles or pointed or cutting parts of a non-functional nature. 6.5.
The ends of the bumpers shall be turned in towards the external surface in order to reduce the risk of fouling. 6.5.2.
The components of the bumper shall be so designed that all rigid surfaces facing outwards have a minimum radius of curvature of 5 mm. 6.6.
The projection shall not exceed 40 mm in the case of lateral door handles and 30 mm in all other cases, 6.6.2.
However, if functional requirements so warrant, wheel discs which cover wheel and hub nuts may project beyond the vertical projection of the external surface or structure on condition that the radius of curvature of the surface of the projecting part is not less than 30 mm and that the projection beyond the vertical projection of the external surface or structure in no case exceeds 30 mm. 6.8.
Sheet-metal edges 6.8.1.
Body panels 6.9.1.
Folds in body panels may have a radius of curvature of less than 2 75 mm, provided that it is not less than one-tenth of the height %quot%H%quot% of the projection, measured in accordance with the method described in Annex II. 6.10.
Lateral deflectors shall have a radius of curvature of at least 1 mm on edges capable of being directed outwards. 6.11.
Jacking brackets 6.11.1.
The jacking bracket shall not project more than a distance of 10 mm beyond the vertical projection of the floor line lying directly above it. (7.) (7.1.) (7.1.1.) (7.1.2.) (7.2.) 8.
CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION (8.1.) 8.2.
The height H of a projection is determined graphically by reference to the circumference of a 165 mm diameter circle, internally tangential to the external outline of the external surface at the section to be checked. 2.
H is the maximum value of the distance, measured along a straight line passing through the centre of the 165 mm diameter circle, between the circumference of the aforesaid circle and the external contour of the projection (see Fig. 1). 3.
In cases where it is not possible for a 100 mm diameter circle to contact externally part of the external outline of the external surface at the section under consideration, the surface outline in this area will be assumed to be that formed by the circumference of the 100 mm diameter circle between its tangent points with the external outline (see Fig. 2). 4.
