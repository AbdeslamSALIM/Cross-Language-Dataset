The treatment that must be applied to the product depends on the health status of the country of origin, in relation to the species the meat is obtained from; in order to avoid an unnecessary burden on trade, imports of poultrymeat products originating in Thailand treated to a temperature of at least 70 ì§¸C throughout the product should continue to be authorised. (12) In relation to animal health requirements, the importation of fresh poultrymeat from certain parts of the territory in the People's Republic of China into the Community was authorised, but then it has been suspended by Commission Decision 2002/69/EC(10) since early 2002 in relation to certain public health requirements.
However, for reasons of clarity and legal certainty it is therefore appropriate to prohibit such imports also on animal health grounds. (14) In accordance with Directive 92/118/EEC(11) (only applicable until 30 April 2004), and with Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council(12), the importation of non-treated game trophies from birds originating from Thailand, the People's Republic of China and South Korea is currently authorised.
