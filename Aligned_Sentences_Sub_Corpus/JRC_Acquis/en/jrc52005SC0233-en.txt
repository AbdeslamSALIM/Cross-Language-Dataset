In accordance with Article 9 of this Regulation, the Council has to examine each convergence programme based on assessments prepared by the Commission and the Committee set up by Article 114 of the Treaty (the Economic and Financial Committee).
They committed themselves to submitting their convergence programmes by 15 May 2004 and a first update thereof towards the end of 2004.
The first convergence programme of Slovenia, covering the period 2004-2007, was submitted on 14 May 2004 and assessed by the Council on 5 July 2004.
Slovenia submitted an update of its convergence programme on 10 January 2005.
This evaluation warrants the following assessment: - On 10 January 2005, Slovenia submitted the first update of its convergence programme, covering the period 2004-2007.
Therefore, Slovenia is invited to achieve compliance with the data requirements. - The macro-economic scenario underlying the updated convergence programme has been revised upwards since the May 2004 convergence programme in light of the favourable developments in the domestic and international environment.
The Commission services take a more cautious view of the disinflation process due to structural imperfections, particularly in the non-tradable sector, which keep inflation well above the EU-average. - The disinflation process came to a halt in May 2004 when the annual growth rate of HICP inflation bounced back to almost 4% after having decreased to 3.5% from January to March.
On 28 June 2004, Slovenia joined the ERM II with a standard fluctuation band of ±15% around a central parity of 239.64 SIT/EUR.
While no reduction is envisaged for 2005 – the general government deficit thus staying at the same level as in 2004 (2.1% of GDP) – 2006 should see the deficit decline to 1.8% of GDP, and further dropping to 1.1% in 2007.
Fiscal consolidation is projected to be channelled mostly through a cut in the expenditure ratio until 2006.
However, the considerable reduction of the deficit foreseen in 2007 is exclusively due to a significant increase in the revenue ratio based on the assumption that Slovenia would be a net recipient from the EU budget in the amount of 0.8% of GDP, up from 0.4% of GDP assumed for 2005-2006.
In particular, the outcome for 2007 is partly due to the new EU financial perspectives 2007-2013, anticipating a significant rise in the net budgetary inflows from the EU budget, to amount to 0.8% of GDP, up from 0.4% the year before.
Based mainly on the stock-flow adjustment, the government foresees a further increase in the debt ratio in the next two years, peaking at 30.9% of GDP in 2006.
The ongoing pension reform has had a positive budgetary impact but the projected increase in pension expenditure beyond 2020 remains very high.
It envisages real GDP growth, estimated at 4.0% in 2004, to continue growing at around that level throughout the rest of the programme period.
On the other hand, the outcome for 2007 is partly due to the new EU financial perspectives 2007-2013, anticipating a significant rise in the net budgetary inflows from the EU budget.
The ongoing pension reform has had a positive budgetary impact but the projected increase in pension expenditure beyond 2020 remains very high.
