ANNEX %quot%ANNEX V Introductory notes 1.
Consequently, to determine if a specific waste is covered by Annex V of Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93, one has to first check whether the waste features in part 1 of Annex V, if this is not the case whether it features in part 2, and if this is not the case whether it features in part 3.
Part 1 is divided into two sub-sections: List A enumerating wastes which are classified as hazardous for the purposes of the Basel Convention and therefore are covered by the export ban and List B enumerating wastes which are not covered by the export ban.
Thus, if a waste features in part 1, one has to check if it is enumerated in List A or in List B.
Only if a waste does not feature in either List A or List B of part 1, one has to check if it features among the hazardous waste of part 2 or in part 3 and if this is the case it is covered by the export ban. 3.
