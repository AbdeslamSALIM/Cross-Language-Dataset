This breach of the Treaty continued until Regulation (EC) No 150/2003 entered into force, that is to say, until 1 January 2003.
The Danish authorities ought, under Articles 2, 9, 10 and 11 of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1552/89 and Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000, to have calculated and entered in their accounts the amounts relating to the imports in question within the prescribed period, in accordance with Article 217(1) of the Community Customs Code, and made those amounts available to the Commission.
The Commission also finds that the amounts corresponding to the customs debt in question were not made available to the Commission before 31 March 2002.
The Commission accordingly finds that, by not establishing its own resources in respect of imports of military equipment and making those resources available to the Commission, Denmark has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 2, 9, 10 and 11 of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1552/89 and of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000. --------------------------------------------------
