Proposal for a Council Regulation fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2006 /* COM/2005/0598 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 24.11.2005 COM(2005) 598 final Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2006 (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
The scientific advice on fishing opportunities in 2006 in the Baltic Sea was delivered by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in June.
The Community has withdrawn from the IBSFC and the organisation will in practise cease to exist by the end of 2005.
Of relevance to management of the fisheries in the Baltic Sea is also Council Regulation (EC) No 88/98 of 18 December 1997 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the waters of the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound.140 - Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union The measures proposed are designed in accordance with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy and is consistent with the Community's policy on sustainable developments. 2.
The recommendation from ICES corresponds to a substantial reduction in the TAC.
In parallel to this proposal the Commission will table a proposal for a long-term management plan for the fisheries on the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea.
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION The proposal has no implication for the Community budget. 5.
The TACs and quotas allocated to Member States are given in Annex I.
The proposed figures reflect the scientific advice and the recommendations adopted by IBSFC at its meeting in September 2005.
The TACs and quotas for the two cod stocks are closely linked to the fishing effort limits laid down in Annex II and point 5 of Annex III.
The TACs are only acceptable if the restrictions in periods where cod fishing is allowed proposed in Annex II and the associated control measures in point 5 of Annex III are adopted.
The transitional technical measures in Annex III (except point 8) represent important measures currently not included in the technical measures regulation for the Baltic Sea (Council Regulation (EC) No 88/98).
