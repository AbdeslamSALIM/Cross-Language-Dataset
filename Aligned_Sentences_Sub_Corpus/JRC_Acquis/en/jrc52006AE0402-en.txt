Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing of European standardisation (COM(2005) 377 final %mdash% 2005/0157 (COD)) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financing of European standardisation (COM(2005) 377 final â€” 2005/0157 (COD)) (2006/C 110/03) On 16 September 2005 the Council decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned proposal.
At its 425th plenary session, held on 15 and 16 March 2006 (meeting of 15 March), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 140 votes to one with one abstention. 1.
In the Committee's view, this should be highlighted as an important point to be included in the recitals. 1.10 The European Commission's proposed total of EUR 134 million for the period 2006-2010 would appear to be barely sufficient. 2.
These acts provide the basis for the European Commission to ask the European standards organisations (CEN, CENELEC, ETSI) to draw up European standards in support of its policies. 2.22 Financial support for European standardisation is governed by the partnership relations established between the European Commission, EFTA and the European standards organisations, which are also specified in the General Guidelines for Cooperation signed on 28 March 2003. 2.23 The financing of European standardisation mainly involves: - annual performance contracts with the ESOs to improve the operation of their central secretariats as regards consistency, efficiency, quality and visibility; - improving the quality of European standardisation by having recourse to external consultants to evaluate draft harmonised standards, and by translating the final version, if necessary; - services for developing European standards or other standardisation products, which are to be drawn up in support of Community policies and legislation; - the promotion and profile of the European standardisation system and European standards; - technical assistance and cooperation involving third countries and international cooperation. 2.23.1 Similarly, standardisation helps in reducing the technical barriers to international trade through the WTO Agreements, such as the TABD (Trans Atlantic Business Dialogue) and the MEBF (Mercosur European Business Forum), and by transposing European standards into international standards: ISO, IEC, ITU. 3.
