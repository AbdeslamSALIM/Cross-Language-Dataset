The French authorities replied by letter dated 12 May 1999. (2) The Commission had already initiated the infringement proceedings provided for in Article 226 of the Treaty against the rendering levy [2].
The Commission decided to drop the proceedings on 26 June 2002. (3) The measure was entered in the register of non-notified aid measures under number NN 17/2001.
In the meantime, the Commission received another complaint raising the same points as the first. (4) By letter dated 10 July 2002, the Commission notified France of its decision to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty with respect to the rendering levy. (5) The Commission Decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities [3].
The Commission asked the other Member States and interested parties to submit their comments on the aid scheme. (6) The French authorities sent their comments by letter dated 10 October 2002.
The French authorities were asked for additional information by letter dated 14 July 2004, which was sent by letter dated 23 September 2004. (7) This Decision concerns only the financing of the public rendering service (hereinafter referred to as the PRS) between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2002, the year in which the investigation procedure was initiated.
The financing of the PRS from 1 January 2003 is being dealt with under State Aid No NN 8/2004. (8) The rendering levy was abolished as from 1 January 2004.
During examination of that levy, the French authorities sent the Commission information that was relevant to the present case, in particular by letter dated 29 December 2003.
THE RENDERING LEVY (9) The rendering levy was introduced by Article 302bis ZD of the French Code général des impôts (General Tax Code), itself introduced by Article 1 of French Law No 96-1139 of 26 December 1996 on the collection and destruction of animal carcases and slaughterhouse waste and amending the Code rural (Rural Code) [5].
Carcases are collected only where the animal, or the lot, weighs a minimum of 40 kg.
Accordingly, the rendering undertakings providing the PRS must provide their collection and destruction services free of charge to users (mainly livestock farmers and slaughterhouses) and are paid exclusively by the State (Article 264-2 of the Code rural). (14) The rendering levy applies to purchases of meat and other specified products by all retailers of those products. (15) The levy is in theory due from anyone who carries out retail sales.
Undertakings whose turnover in the previous calendar year is less than FRF 2500000 [6] (EUR 381122) excluding VAT are exempt from payment of the levy.
The rate of the levy is 0,5 % on monthly purchases of up to FRF 125000 (EUR 19056) excluding VAT and 0,9 % on monthly purchases above that amount.
The fund was managed by the Centre national pour l'aménagement des structures des exploitations agricoles (CNASEA - The National Centre for the Development of Farm Structures). (17) Law No 98-546 of 2 July 1998 laying down various economic and financial provisions [7] imposed an additional levy on the same operators during the period from 1 July to 31 December 1998, mainly to finance the destruction of mammal meal not in compliance with Community rules on the deactivation of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agents, and in particular expenditure on purchasing, transporting, storing and processing such meal.
Undertakings whose turnover in the previous calendar year was less than FRF 3500000 (EUR 533571) excluding VAT were exempted from this additional levy.
The rate of the levy was 0,3 % on monthly purchases of up to FRF 125000 (EUR 19056) excluding VAT and 0,5 % on monthly purchases above that amount (18) Article 35 of the Loi de finances rectificative pour 2000 (Amending Finance Act for 2000) (Law No 2000-1353 of 30 December 2000) [8] made a number of amendments to the rendering levy scheme, which entered into force on 1 January 2001.
The levy was increased to 2,1 % on monthly purchases of up to FRF 125000 (EUR 19056) and 3,9 % on monthly purchases above that amount.
In addition, all undertakings with a turnover in the previous calendar year of less than FRF 5000000 (EUR 762245) excluding VAT were exempt from the levy.
Finally, as from 31 December 2000, revenue from the levy was assigned directly to the national budget rather than to the fund referred to in recital 16. (19) This increase in the rendering levy is claimed, among other things, to be in response to the need to destroy not only animal carcases and material seized at slaughterhouses and recognised as being unfit for human or animal consumption, of which there is probably more than in the past because of the BSE crisis, and the parts of carcases that were previously used for manufacturing animal meal and other products, but also animal meal whose use was temporarily banned by Council Decision 2000/766/EC of 4 December 2000 concerning certain protection measures with regard to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and the feeding of animal proteins [9]. 2.
The development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Community. (21) The French authorities consider that the measures financed are in the public interest.
It had then to be determined whether those payments exceeded the costs to those undertakings of carrying out those activities. (23) When the investigation procedure was opened, however, the Commission did not have all the information required to determine whether all the criteria for the introduction of a public service had been fulfilled.
The Commission also noted that the French legislation introducing the obligation to remove carcases did not apply to all farmers. (28) As regards meat and offal seized at slaughterhouses, at the time the investigation procedure was opened, the Commission authorised the national authorities to cover 100 % of certain costs normally borne by producers but only in very specific situations.
This also applied to the additional levy imposed from 1 July to 31 December 1998. (29) As regards marketing undertakings exempted from payment of the levy, at the time the investigation procedure was opened the Commission had reason to believe that aid there was covered by point 3.5 of the agricultural guidelines.
At the time the investigation procedure was opened, the Commission was of the opinion that imposing the levy on products imported from other Member States to finance the rendering service may be incompatible with the competition rules and that the State aid so financed may be incompatible with the Treaty. (32) From 1 January 2001, revenue from the levy was assigned directly to the national budget.
In that opinion, the Commission noted that the rendering levy scheme constituted a discriminatory tax measure incompatible with Article 90 of the Treaty because it was applied to meat imported from other Member States whereas only French meat producers had access to the PRS financed by the product of the levy. (40) In addition, under Article 234 of the Treaty, the Lyon Administrative Court of Appeal referred a question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling concerning the interpretation of Article 87(1) of the Treaty [18] with regard to the rendering levy.
The Court gave its judgment in this case on 20 November 2003 (hereafter the GEMO case). (41) In the GEMO case, the Lyon Administrative Court of Appeal asked the Court of Justice to give a preliminary ruling on whether the levy on purchases of meat provided for in Article 302 ZD of the Code général des impôts could be regarded as aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty. (42) The Court replied that the State was responsible for the collection and destruction of animal carcases and slaughterhouse waste from French livestock farmers and slaughterhouses.
COMMENTS SUBMITTED BY THIRD PARTIES (43) The interested parties submitted the following comments, which were forwarded to the French authorities on 11 February 2003. 1.
The Commission, after examining the reasons given, took the view that their request should be granted. (45) According to these undertakings, the rendering levy is aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty in favour, in particular, of livestock farmers and slaughterhouses.
Therefore, under Article 87(1) of Treaty, by releasing livestock farmers and slaughterhouse from a financial burden, the rendering levy gives a financial advantage to "certain undertakings", affecting "trade between Member States" and "distort(ing) competition", by reducing the cost of French meat exports and burdening meat imports with the cost of destroying dangerous livestock products, a cost they already bear in their country of origin. (46) Furthermore, they claim the measure is illegal, since it was not notified to the Commission.
COMMENTS SUBMITTED BY THE L’ASSOCIATION DES ENTREPRISES DE PRODUITS ALIMENTAIRES ÉLABORÉS (ADEPALE) (ASSOCIATION OF FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES) (48) ADEPALE points out that the levy was introduced against the background of serious problems in destroying bovine carcases following the outbreak of BSE.
This results in a significant difference in the competitiveness of products containing more than 10 % meat and all other foodstuffs, i.e.
COMMENTS SUBMITTED BY THE FÉDÉRATION DES ENTREPRISES DU COMMERCE ET DE LA DISTRIBUTION (FCD) (FEDERATION OF TRADERS AND DISTRIBUTORS) (52) The FCD already took the view that the aid conferred two advantages, reducing the business risks that rendering undertakings normally had to face and eliminating a cost normally borne by livestock farmers and slaughterhouses, as producers of carcases and material seized at slaughterhouses. (53) The FCD stressed in particular that the French mechanism for financing the PRS was not compatible with Article 86(2) of the Treaty because no satisfactory measures had been introduced to ensure effective competition when public contracts were awarded for the rendering service and because the financing overcompensated for the cost of the service. (54) The FCD also pointed out that the public financing received by the French rendering undertakings was intended not only to finance the PRS as defined by the legislation, but also to finance other activities not falling within the scope of that legislation, such as the destruction of animal meal produced both before and after the Community ban of December 2000, for which aid of EUR 205 million was paid to rendering undertakings as an emergency measure and without an invitation to tender. (55) The FCD complained about a new illegal State aid introduced in 2002 and financed by means of the levy on meat purchases, granted to small butchers who themselves destroy the bones of the spinal column in direct contact with the spinal cord of bovine animals of more than 12 months old.
They alleged that the aid amounted to EUR 20 million. 4.
COMMENTS SUBMITTED BY SPAIN (56) Spain criticises the fact that the scheme discriminates against imports of meat and meat products from other countries, since a levy was imposed on them but nothing was given in return and that the product of the levy solely benefited French livestock farmers and slaughterhouses. (57) It argues that the situation was aggravated in Spain by the abolition of all national aid with effect from 1 January 2002 and claim that all the costs of destroying meat waste were already included in the price of exported products.
COMMENTS SUBMITTED BY FRANCE (58) By letter dated 10 October 2002, the French authorities presented their comments on the Commission’s Decision to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 88(2) of the Treaty with regard to the aid in question.
In response to a request from the Commission, additional information was sent by letter dated 23 September 2004. (59) The French authorities deemed it necessary briefly to recall the general financing of the PRS.
This Law forms part of a health system comprising two basic Decrees: - a Decree of 28 June 1996 amending a Decree of 30 December 1991 and providing for the incineration of finished products manufactured from high-risk material, defined as farm animals not slaughtered for human consumption, other animal carcases, animals slaughtered as a disease-control measure, animal waste presenting clinical signs of a disease communicable to man or other animals, animals dying during transport and animal waste presenting a risk to human or animal health, - a Decree of 10 September 1996 suspending the marketing and release for consumption of certain ruminant tissue and of products incorporating such tissue, known as specified risk material (SRM).
This scheme differs from that established by Decree No 2000-1166 of 1 December 2000 [21] instituting a compensation scheme for manufacturers of certain meals and fats prohibited in the manufacture of animal feedingstuffs by the Decree of 14 November 2000.
This latter scheme was notified to the Commission on 18 January 2002. (65) With regard to meal, the French authorities point out that the PRS is only responsible for the incineration of meal manufactured from the products collected by the PRS.
It does not finance the incineration of products resulting from the ban on using meal in animal feedingstuffs. (66) The PRS was financed from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2000 by a levy, provided for in Article 1 of Law No 96-1139 of 26 December 1996, the product of which was paid into a fund managed by the CNASEA.
From 1 January 2001, the service was financed from the national budget. 1.
REGARDING THE EXISTENCE OF AID TO RENDERING UNDERTAKINGS (67) The French authorities point out that, under points 27 to 48 of the Decision to open the procedure, the Commission admits that the PRS, justified for reasons of public health and environmental protection, could be of general interest within the meaning of Article 86(2) of the Treaty.
The Commission questioned, in particular, the remuneration from public funds of the undertakings responsible for the PRS. (68) The French authorities explained that the total amount paid to rendering undertakings for the period 1997-2002 was EUR 828552389 and corresponded to the total expenditure on the public rendering service (PRS).
Invitations to tender were usually issued at departmental or regional level, as were requisitions, for which prefectoral decrees were issued. (69) Given the rules for awarding public contracts and those governing requisitions, the French authorities take the view that the payments made could not have had an impact on any competitive activities of the beneficiary undertakings. (70) The French authorities state that, under Article 264-2 of the Code rural, as amended by Decree No 96-1229 of 27 December 1996 on the public rendering service and amending the Code rural [22], as amended by Decree No 97-1005 of 30 October 1997 [23], the PRS is subject to the procedures for the award of public contracts.
Thus, Article 264-2 of the Code rural lays down in particular: "I – The prefect shall, in each department, be responsible for establishing a public rendering service and shall conclude, in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Code des Marches Publics, the necessary contracts, for which he shall be the responsible person within the meaning of Article 44 of that Code.
These requisitions were issued under Order No 59-63 of 6 January 1959 on the requisition of goods and services [24] and implementing Decree No 62-367 of 26 March 1962 [25]. (75) According to these provisions, remuneration for requisitioned services must take the form of compensation covering solely proven, direct, material loss incurred by the service provider as a result of the requisition.
The most important ones, CAILLAUD, SARIA, FERSO-BIO and Équarrissage Moderne du Var, have thirteen installations processing raw waste from the PRS into animal meal.
Payments for these services can therefore be estimated at an average of 30 % of the turnover of the industrial processors. (81) In conclusion, given that the PRS was established by means of a legislative act and in view of the rules on the award of public contracts and requisitions, the French authorities consider that the payments made to the undertakings providing the PRS do not exceed the additional cost of fulfilling their obligations. 2.
Even if aid could be justified for the purpose of combating disease, the Commission considers that it could be incompatible with the common market in that it goes beyond the measures authorised under the agricultural guidelines. (83) Firstly, the French authorities draw the Commission’s attention to the special nature of the meat market over the period from 1996 to 2000.
Indeed, while carcases and other waste were recognised as unsuitable for consumption in France and had to be incinerated under the Decrees of 28 June and 10 September 1996, the same products continued to be processed in the other Member States. (84) At Community level, the Decisions requiring the withdrawal from the market and the destruction of the products concerned took effect only on 1 October 2000 for specified risk material, under Commission Decision 2000/418/EC regulating the use of material presenting risks as regards transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and amending Decision 94/474/EC [26], and on 1 March 2001, under Commission Decision 2001/25/EC prohibiting the use of certain animal by-products in animal feed [27]. (85) In the absence of harmonisation, according to the French authorities, for four years the price of beef and veal in the other Member States, which took account of any cost involved in collecting carcases and other waste, could also be regarded as taking account of the value added to those products.
They also argue that there was no increase in exports to the United Kingdom, the only Member State in which, because of the extent of the BSE crisis, a large-scale system for processing and incinerating carcases had been set up. (87) If the Commission were to conclude that there was aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty, the French authorities take the view that this is justified as a measure forming part of a mechanism to combat animal diseases.
Against this background, products considered to be dangerous must be completely destroyed under conditions that prevent any risks to human and animal health. (90) With regard to carcases, the French authorities affirm that the Commission itself realised the need to prohibit the use of these products by banning the use in feed intended for livestock not only of animals slaughtered on holdings as part of disease control measures by also of all bovine animals, sheep, goats, solipeds and poultry dying on holdings but not slaughtered for human consumption (abovementioned Decision 2001/25/EC). (91) The French authorities state that, in addition, it appeared that in the other Member States involved the withdrawal of carcases from the animal food chain in 2001 led to the adoption of official provisions giving the authorities full responsibility for the destruction of carcases. (92) For the French authorities, material seized at slaughterhouses falls into the same category of products posing a risk to human and animal health.
It consists of products declared unfit for human consumption, the list of which was laid down in the Decree of 17 March 1992 on the conditions that installations slaughtering animals for the production and marketing of fresh meat must satisfy and laying down the rules for health inspections of those establishments and the Decree of 8 June 1996 laying down rules for post mortem health inspections of poultry and transposing various Community health Directives. (93) During collection and processing, carcases and material seized at slaughterhouses, including SRM, are kept separate from other waste. (94) Accordingly, the French authorities take the view that the measures financed by the PRS are justified as measures to combat animal diseases. 3.
REGARDING THE EXISTENCE OF AID TO UNDERTAKINGS EXEMPTED FROM PAYMENT OF THE LEVY (95) Regarding the possible existence of aid to undertakings exempted from payment of the levy provided for in Article 1 of Law No 96-1139 of 26 December 1996 and codified in Article 302bis ZD of the Code général des impôts, the French authorities put forward the following arguments. (96) From 1997 to 2000, the levy was due from all persons making retail sales of meat and other products such as salted meats, cured meat products, lard, preserved meats, processed offal and meat- and offal-based animal feed and whose turnover during the previous calendar year was at least FRF 2,5 million excluding VAT. (97) Article 35 of the Loi de finances rectificative pour 2000 extended the levy to all meat products. (98) As from 1 January 2001, the rate of the levy was increased from 0,6 % to 2,1 % on monthly purchases of up to FRF 125000 and from 1,0 % to 3,9 % on monthly purchases above that amount.
At the same time, the threshold for the levy was increased to FRF 5 million (EUR 763000) excluding VAT. (99) According to the French authorities, the threshold is fixed on the basis of an objective and rational criterion.
Imports of meat from other Member States amount to approximately 16 % of all meat consumed in France and are mainly intended for home catering.
REGARDING THE FINANCING OF THE SCHEME (103) The French authorities state that the Commission is of the opinion that the PRS might be financed by means of a tax that is incompatible with Article 90 of the Treaty, which prohibits discriminatory internal taxation.
They refer, in particular, to the infringement proceedings initiated in 1998. (104) On this point, the French authorities referred the Commission to the arguments put forward in their letter to the Commission dated 18 September 1998 in response to the letter giving formal notice dated 29 July 1998.
The provision inserted in the Code général des impôts by Article 1 of Law No 96-1139 could have been inserted quite as legitimately in the 1997 Loi de finances.
Nevertheless, for reasons of procedure, to ensure parallelism between new Government expenditure and the necessary revenue and because of their similar objectives, revenue from the levy at that time being intended to finance a fund from which the PRS would in turn be financed, Article 302bis ZD was inserted in the Code général des impôts by Law No 96-1139. (107) The French authorities point out that the levy introduced by Article 302bis ZD of the Code général des impôts is a levy on meat purchases.
Article 1(B) of Law No 96-1139 stipulated that revenue from the levy collected under Article 302bis ZD of the Code général des impôts was assigned to a fund intended to finance the collection and destruction of carcases and slaughterhouse waste unfit for consumption. (108) The Loi de finances rectificative pour 2000 stopped the revenue from the levy on meat purchases going to the fund after 31 December 2000.
Consequently, the levy on meat purchases, which has appeared as such in the tax revenue in the national budget since 1 January 2001, is no longer assigned to specific expenditure but is paid into the general national budget.
The increases made in the Loi de finances rectificative pour 2000 were intended, along with other tax and budgetary measures, to adjust Government expenditure and revenue. (110) The French authorities admit that the financing of the PRS by the Ministry of Agriculture constituted significant new expenditure that had an impact on the rebalancing of Government financial resources carried out at the time.
Budget Chapter 44-71 was created in 2001.
The total revenue from the rendering levy between 1997 and 2002 was EUR 1337676215 and total expenditure on the PRS was EUR 828552389. (in EUR) | | Revenue from the levy recorded by the Treasury | Expenditure on the PRS | Revenue from the levy recorded by the Treasury | Budget assigned to the CNASEA | Expenditure on the PRS | 1997 | 83702949 | 63577613 | | | | 1998 | 111557213 | 101235325 | | | | 1999 | 98223855 | 104428265 | | | | 2000 | 93868217 | 147839108 | | | | Subtotal 1 | 387352234 | 417080311 | | | | 2001 | | | 423083271 | 185684975 | 181777656 | 2002 | | | 527240710 | 224891780 | 229694422 | Subtotal 2 | | | 950323981 | 410576755 | 411472078 | 5.
ARTICLE 87(1) OF THE TREATY (123) In accordance with Article 87(1) of the Treaty, save as otherwise provided in the Treaty itself, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods is, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, incompatible with the common market. (124) Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaty are applicable to the pigmeat sector pursuant to Article 21 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat [29].
They are applicable to the beef and veal sector pursuant to Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal [30].
Before the latter was adopted, they were applicable to that sector pursuant to Article 24 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal [31].
They are applicable to the poultrymeat sector pursuant to Article 19 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in poultrymeat [32]. 1.1.
If that is so, the measure meets the condition of selectivity that is inherent in the concept of State aid in those provisions. (126) Furthermore, according to the Court, assistance of any form whatsoever which is likely to favour certain undertakings directly or indirectly or which must be regarded as an economic advantage which the beneficiary undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions must be regarded as aid [33]. (127) In addition, according to the Court's case law, in particular measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which, without therefore being subsidies in the strict meaning of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect, are considered to constitute aid [34]. (128) In the case in point, the system is financed by a parafiscal charge introduced by the authorities and the State is accordingly responsible for it, as the Court made clear, moreover, in its judgment in the GEMO case. (129) The existence and indeed the nature of the aid must be established at the level of the potential beneficiaries of the PRS and the way it is financed.
Subsequently, it needed to decide whether such payments had exceeded the costs borne by those undertaking in the performance of those activities. (131) According to the French legislation, rendering undertakings perform a public-service mission enshrined in law involving the collection and disposal of animal carcases and meat and offal seized at slaughterhouses and recognised as unfit for human or animal consumption. (132) The Court of Justice pointed out in the GEMO case that according to Article 264-1 of the Rural Code, the PRS is assigned to undertakings awarded public procurement contracts concluded with the Prefects of each department. (133) The fact that SRM is financed by the proceeds of a parafiscal charge levied on vendors of meat implies that the undertakings performing this service receive public funds to cover the costs of that service. (134) Rendering is also an economic activity.
In France, the sector is dominated by two major undertakings, which between them account for between 80 % and 90 % of the market and have a turnover, at least in one case, of over EUR 152 million [35]. (135) The Court of Justice's judgment of 24 July 2003 in the Altmark case [36] shows that public subsidies intended to allow public services to operate do not fall within the scope of Article 87 of the Treaty in so far as such subsidies should be regarded as compensation for the services performed by the recipient undertakings in discharge of public service obligations.
Implementing Decree No 96-1229 of 27 December 1996 provides that the PRS is to be put out to tender for public procurement contracts under specific conditions. (140) According to the French authorities, Article R 226-7 of the Rural Code provides in particular that the Prefect of each department is to be charged with the performance of the PRS and is to award the requisite contracts in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Public Procurement Code.
The French authorities were also asked to show that resources could not have been diverted to other competitive activities that those undertakings might carry out (cross-subsidies). (148) The Commission notes that the French authorities simply explained that the total sums paid to rendering undertakings for the period 1997 to 2002 amounted to EUR 828552389 and that this corresponds to the total cost of the PRS.
The Commission can therefore state a position only on the basis of that information. (149) In the case in point, the lack of more detailed information and figures covering payments made to rendering undertakings during the period 1997 to 2002 and proving that such payments have in no case exceeded the additional costs of providing the PRS means the Commission cannot be certain that the third condition in the Altmark judgment has actually been respected.
In addition, lacking more precise information, the Commission has not been able to inquire into the existence of any cross-subsidies within those undertakings. (150) These doubts are also confirmed by a report drafted in 1997 by the Comité Permanent de Coordination des Inspections (COPERCI Report) at the request of the French Agriculture Minister; according to the Report, "the rendering undertakings may have benefited from generous hand-outs when the proceeds of the levy used to pay for their services was collected"; the Report goes on say that "there is a potential risk of double payment for incineration operations since payments were made without the operations actually being performed" and that "rendering, which was structurally in deficit before the BSE crisis, is now profitable again". (151) As a consequence, the Commission considers that it cannot be stated, as the Court requires, that the compensation does not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit for discharging those obligations. (152) It is, however, true that the complainants' claims were not backed up by precise figures on payments made to rendering undertakings and on the costs of operations arising from performance of the PRS showing that those undertakings received overcompensation.
Furthermore, the fact that the proceeds of the levy and the cost of the PRS do not tally is not sufficient to demonstrate an imbalance between the payments made and the cost of rendering. (153) In the light of the foregoing and the information provided by the French authorities, the Commission cannot therefore conclude that all the conditions set out in the Altmark judgment have been met and payments made to rendering undertakings are therefore not caught by the definition of State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty. (154) Even if the main beneficiaries of the measures financed by the charge were farmers and slaughterhouses (see point 1.1.2), the Commission cannot rule out an element of aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty in payments made to rendering undertakings. 1.1.2.
As a consequence, the removal free of charge of the spinal columns from butchers' premises and cutting plants from 1 January 2002 constitutes State aid to these undertakings. 1.1.5.
It is for the Member State which has made such a distinction between enterprises in terms of charges to show that it is actually justified by the nature and the general scheme of the tax system [37]. (165) French Act No 96-1139 provides for exemption for enterprises retailing meat whose annual turnover is less that FRF 2,5 million (this ceiling was subsequently raised to FRF 5 million: see recital 18).
For instance, an enterprise selling meat alone and realising a turnover of FRF 2,4 million on meat sales would therefore not be subject to the levy.
But a general food enterprise realising an overall turnover of FRF 10 million, of which FRF 1 million is on meat sales, would be subject to the levy.
As the levy is calculated on the value of meat products, enterprises with a higher turnover on meat sales should hardly be exempt from the levy when their competitors with a lower turnover on meat products have to pay it. (167) As a consequence, that exemption is a selective advantage for trade exempted from payment [39].
On the basis of the figures for trade in meat set out in recital 171, the Commission concludes that exempting traders with a turnover of less than FRF 2,5 million (and subsequently FRF 5 million) from the levy is an advantage constituting State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty. 1.2.
The Commission therefore notes that the payments granted to the French rendering undertakings affect trade between Member States within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty. (171) As far as rendering undertakings, livestock farmers and slaughterhouses, cutting plants and butchers holding SRM are concerned, the fact that there is trade in meat products between Member States is plain from the existence of various market organisations in the sector, which are listed in recital 124.
Table 2 shows the level of trade between France and the other Member States in the most significant products in the first year of application of the rendering levy.
France/EU-14 | Beef | Pigmeat | Poultrymeat | Tonnes | 286000 | 465000 | 140000 | ECU million | 831 | 1003 | 258 | Tonnes | 779000 | 453000 | 468000 | ECU million | 1967 | 954 | 1069 | (172) It is also worth pointing out that, according to figures provided to the Commission, live animals imported into France in 1999 were worth FRF 2297 million, while French imports of meat and edible offal amounted to nearly FRF 17000 million.
Rendering was therefore carried out in the country of origin on the bulk of meat products imported into France. (173) Accordingly, as the Commission stated when the investigation was initiated, the complainants also cite a circular published by the French Direction Générale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la Répression des Fraudes, to the effect that the levy on purchases of meat "may affect foreign producers' profit margins or reduce their sales" and accordingly "it carries the risk of adversely affecting trading conditions." (174) The Commission therefore concludes that the measure in favour of livestock farmers and slaughterhouses has at least potential impact on trade. (175) As regards trade exempted from the levy, the Commission is of the opinion that the exemption from the levy has at least potential impact, in particular in border areas, and therefore on cross-border trade. (176) By way of a conclusion, all these aid measures taken together appear likely to affect trade between Member States.
As a consequence, the Commission concludes that those measures fall within the scope of Article 87(1) of the Treaty. 2.
COMPATIBILITY OF THE AID MEASURES (179) Article 87 of the Treaty makes provision, however, for exceptions from the general principle that State aid is incompatible with the Treaty, although some of those exceptions clearly do not apply, and in particular those laid down in paragraph 2 of that Article.
To qualify under the exception referred to in that point, the aid must contribute to the development of the sector in question. 2.1.
Article 1(f) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 88 of the EC Treaty [41] defines unlawful aid as new aid put into effect in contravention of Article 88(3) of the Treaty.
According to the Court, where the method of financing the aid, in particular through compulsory contributions, forms an integral part of the aid measure, the Commission must take that method of financing into account when examining the aid [43]. (186) In accordance with point 23.3 of the Community Guidelines for State aid in the agriculture sector and the Commission Notice on the determination of the applicable rules for the assessment of unlawful State aid [44], any unlawful aid within the meaning of Article 1(f) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 must be assessed in accordance with the rules and guidelines in force at the time the aid was granted. (187) In 2002, the Commission adopted Community Guidelines for State aid concerning TSE tests, fallen stock and slaughterhouse waste [45] (hereinafter referred to as the TSE Guidelines).
Those Guidelines have been applicable since 1 January 2003.
Point 44 of the TSE Guidelines provides that, leaving aside cases relating to fallen stock and slaughterhouse waste, unlawful aid within the meaning of Article 1(f) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999(5) is to be assessed in accordance with the rules and guidelines applicable at the time when the aid was granted.
As a consequence, as far as unlawful State aid to cover the costs of removing and destroying fallen stock, granted at the production, processing and marketing stages before the date of application of the TSE Guidelines, is concerned and without prejudice to compliance with other provisions of Community law, the Commission will authorise State aid of up to 100 % of such costs. (190) In accordance with point 47 of the TSE Guidelines, as far as State aid for slaughterhouse waste is concerned, a series of individual decisions have been taken by the Commission since January 2001 authorising State aid of up to 100 % of the costs of disposing of SRM, meat and bone meal, and animal feed containing such products, which must be disposed of under the new Community legislation on TSEs (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies).
The Commission will apply the same principles to unlawful State aid granted before the end of 2002 for comparable costs in relation to new Community legislation on TSEs, and without prejudice to compliance with other provisions of Community law. (191) Any operating aid in favour of other operators must be considered in the light of the agriculture Guidelines. 2.3.
Aid to rendering undertakings (192) As regards unlawful State aid to cover the costs of removing and destroying fallen stock, granted at the production, processing and marketing stages before the date of implementation of those Guidelines and without prejudice to other provisions of Community legislation, point 46 of the TSE Guidelines provides that the Commission will authorise State aid of up to 100 % of those costs. (193) As regards State aid for slaughterhouse waste, point 47 of the TSE Guidelines states that a series of individual decisions have been taken by the Commission since January 2001, authorising State aid covering up to 100 % of the cost of disposing of SRM, meat and bone meal, and animal feed containing such products, which must be disposed of under the new Community legislation on TSEs. (194) In addition, the Commission notes that, in line with points 33 and 34 of the TSE Guidelines, the undertakings were chosen and remunerated according to market principles, in a non-discriminatory manner, where necessary by issuing an invitation to tender in accordance with Community law, and in any event using advertising on a scale sufficient to ensure the services market was open to free competition and the impartiality of the procurement rules could be reviewed.
The Commission agrees that requisitioning was also a suitable method under the circumstances, given the urgency of the measures to be taken and the lack of response to the invitations to tender. (195) Point 47 of the TSE Guidelines points out that, by way of an exception, the Commission has agreed that such State aid should also be granted to operators other than those active in the production of live animals, such as slaughterhouses.
The Commission is of the opinion that this exception must also cover other enterprises performing tasks closely linked to the production of live animals, such as rendering undertakings. (196) On the basis of the facts outlined, the Commission is in a position to conclude that the aid for rendering undertakings in the case in point, granted in France during the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2002 and covering 100 % of the costs incurred, meets the conditions in the TSE Guidelines. 2.3.1.2.
Aid to livestock farmers – Fallen stock (197) As regards unlawful State aid to cover the costs of removing and destroying fallen stock granted at the production, processing and marketing stages before the date of application of the TSE Guidelines and without prejudice to compliance with other provisions of Community law, point 46 of the TSE Guidelines provides that the Commission will authorise State aid of up to 100 % of such costs. (198) On the basis of the facts outlined, the Commission is therefore in a position to conclude that the aid for farmers granted in France during the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2002 and covering 100 % of the costs incurred meets the conditions laid down in the TSE Guidelines. 2.3.1.3.
Aid to slaughterhouses – Meat and offal seized at slaughterhouses (199) Point 47 of the TSE Guidelines provides that as regards State aid for slaughterhouse waste, the Commission authorises unlawful State aid granted before the end of 2002 and covering up to 100 % of the cost of disposing of SRM, meat and bone meal, and animal feed containing such products, which must be disposed of under the new Community legislation on TSEs. (200) On the basis of the facts outlined, the Commission is therefore in a position to conclude that the aid for slaughterhouses in the case in point, granted in France during the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2002 and covering 100 % of the costs incurred, meets the conditions laid down in the TSE Guidelines. 2.3.1.4.
Aid to butchers – SRM seized at butcheries (201) Point 47 of the TSE Guidelines is applicable mutatis mutandis to SRM – in the case in point, spinal columns of bovine animals over 12 months – seized at butcheries and cutting plants. (202) On the basis of the facts outlined, the Commission is thus in a position to conclude that the aid for butchers holding SRM that may have been granted in France during the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2002, covering 100 % of the costs incurred, meets the conditions laid down in the TSE Guidelines. 2.3.1.5.
The selective scope of the exemption in question is plain when it is borne in mind that, according to the Commission's information, 80 % of meat and meat products is sold in superstores whose average overall turnover and even their specific turnover on meat is, according to the Commission's information, well above that ceiling [49], while small shops (butcheries), whose average turnover is below the ceiling (FRF 1.6 million), are in competition with the large stores. (205) The effect of the ceiling therefore appears to be to exempt butchers and other stores, while the large majority of distributors, which is made up of large stores, have to pay the levy.
Furthermore, in so far as the ceiling relates to overall turnover (and not just to turnover on meat), a butchery with a turnover of FRF 2,4 million, for example, is exempt from the tax while a large store that sells less meat but has an overall turnover in excess of the ceiling must pay the levy.
As a result, the exception laid down in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty is not applicable. (210) In the light of the foregoing, the Commission concludes that the tax exemption in the case in point is aid that is incompatible with the competition rules applicable. 2.3.2.
Prior to 31 December 2000 (211) Until 31 December 2000, the French authorities chose to finance the PRS by means of a parafiscal charge levied on retailers of meat and meat products and paid into a fund for managing it. (212) In the course of the infringement procedure referred to in recital 2, the Commission noted that the method of financing the rendering service excluded any fees levied on those using the service.
In line with the case law, the Commission considers that an aid measure cannot be financed by parafiscal charges that are levied on products imported from other Member States too. (219) In the light of the case law and the fact that the levy was used to finance State aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty and was discriminatory in contravention of Article 90 of the Treaty in so far as it was charged on products from other Member States that cannot benefit from the advantages of the fund into which it was paid, the Commission considered that the proceeds of the levy realised on products imported from other Member States were against the rules on competition. 2.3.2.2.
After 31 December 2000 (220) Since 1 January 2001, the proceeds of the rendering levy are paid directly into the general budget of the State and no longer into the fund set up for that purpose.
It accordingly becomes impossible to say whether a levy discriminates against other products because the proceeds of the levy are merged with the rest of the State's revenue and the financing of the aid can no longer be attributed directly to it. (221) The Commission closed the infringement procedure on 26 June 2002.
Such a separation could in practice amount to the tax system that was called into question by the Commission under Article 90 of the Treaty, under the infringement procedure referred to in recital 2. (224) The French authorities admit that, when the new provisions on the levy were presented, the emphasis was laid on the need to continue financing the PRS.
Furthermore, Table 1 shows that the proceeds of the levy for the 2001 and 2002 tax years (EUR 950323981) and the total amount paid for the PRS (EUR 411472078) are far from equivalent, that this is also true for each of those years, and that only part of the proceeds of the levy was intended to finance the PRS, which is a strong argument that the rendering levy is quite separate from the way the PRS has been financed since 1 January 2001. (231) In addition, the Commission notes that, following the opening of the investigation, it has not received other information from the complainants providing clear, definitive backing for their arguments on the subject.
The arguments put forward by the complainant have not enabled the Commission to establish a link between the parafiscal charge and the aid scheme. (232) The Commission therefore reaffirms its conclusions under the closed infringement procedure and concludes that there is a separation between the rendering levy and the way the PRS has been financed since 1 January 2001. 2.3.2.3.
CONCLUSION (234) The State aid scheme in favour of rendering undertakings, livestock farmers and slaughterhouses implemented by France between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2000 to fund the public rendering service, financed by a levy on meat purchases and on products coming from other Member States satisfied the Community provisions applicable to those beneficiaries.
The Commission has also established, however, that there was a breach of Article 90 of the Treaty as regards the financing of the scheme.
For that reason the Commission cannot state that the scheme was compatible, since it discriminated between imported products and national ones. (235) The Commission considers it appropriate in this case to adopt a conditional decision by making use of the possibility afforded by Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, which allows it to attach to its positive decision conditions making it possible for it to recognise the compatibility with the common market and obligations enabling it to monitor compliance with that decision. (236) In order to make good the breach of Article 90 and eliminate the discrimination retroactively, France must reimburse the part of the levy imposed on products coming from other Member States within a period and under conditions set by the Commission.
Making good the breach would make the aid in question compatible with Article 87 of the Treaty. (237) The Commission is laying down the conditions that must be met for that reimbursement.
France therefore must reimburse the persons liable for payment of the levy the part levied on meat coming from other Member States between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2000 in compliance with the following conditions: - France will notify the parties responsible for payment of the levy individually within a period of not more than six months from the date of notification of this decision of their individual right to reimbursement, - in order to submit a request for reimbursement the persons liable for payment of the levy must be given a period that complies with national law, and in any case not less than six months, - reimbursement must be made within a maximum period of six months from the date of submission of the request, - the amounts reimbursed must be updated to take account of interest from the date on which they were levied up to the date of actual reimbursement.
The interest will be calculated on the basis of the Commission reference rate laid down by the method used for setting the reference and discount rates [52], - the French authorities will accept any reasonable evidence from the parties liable for payment showing the part of the levy paid on meat coming from other Member States, - the right to reimbursement may not be made subject to other conditions, in particular that of not having passed on the levy, - where a levy payer has not yet paid the levy, the French authorities will formally waive their right to payment of it, including any interest on arrears, - the French authorities will send the Commission, within a period of not more than 20 months from the date of notification of this decision, a full report showing that the reimbursement measure has been properly executed. (238) By letter of 9 December 2004, France gave an undertaking to comply with these conditions. (239) If France failed to fulfil its undertaking regarding those conditions, the Commission could re-open the formal investigation procedure, as provided for in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, or refer the matter to the Court of Justice, as provided for in Article 23 of the Regulation.
Such a possibility could, as provided for in Article 14 of the Regulation, result in the adoption of a final negative decision with recovery of all the aid granted during the period concerned, which is estimated to amount to EUR 417 080 311. (240) The State aid scheme which France implemented between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2002 in favour of rendering undertakings, livestock farmers and slaughterhouses to finance the public rendering service, financed by a levy on meat purchases, is compatible with the common market under Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty. (241) The State aid scheme which France implemented in 2002 in favour of butchers and cutting plants holding specified risk material (SRM) to finance the public rendering service, financed by a levy on meat purchases, is compatible with the common market under Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty. (242) The measure in the form of exemption from payment of the levy on meat purchases in favour of certain undertakings marketing meat, in force from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2002, constitutes State aid which is incompatible with the common market. (243) The measures covered by this decision have not been notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 88(3) of the Treaty and therefore constitute unlawful aid within the meaning of Article 1(f) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999. (244) The Commission regrets that France implemented the measures in breach of Article 88(3) of the Treaty. (245) Since the aid in question was implemented without awaiting a final decision of the Commission, it should be borne that, in view of the mandatory nature of the rules of procedure laid down in Article 88(3) of the Treaty, whose direct effect the Court of Justice recognised in its judgments in Carmine Capolongo v Azienda Agricola Maya [53], Gebrueder Lorenz GmbH v Germany [54] and Steinicke and Weinlig v Germany [55], the unlawfulness of the aid concerned cannot be remedied a posteriori (judgment in Fédération nationale du commerce extérieur des produits alimentaires et al v France [56]). (246) The Court of Justice has held that where an aid measure, of which the method of financing is an integral part, has been implemented in breach of the obligation to notify, the national courts must in principle order reimbursement of charges or contributions levied specifically for the purpose of financing that aid.
Such a breach, relied on by the individuals who may contest its legality and established by the national courts, must induce them to draw the necessary consequences, in accordance with their national law, concerning both the validity of the acts involving the implementation of the aid measures concerned and the recovery of the financial support granted [57]. (247) The Commission has no details of the way in which reimbursements of the levy made or to be made on that basis will actually lead to full reimbursement, in particular of any levy on meat from other Member States. (248) Where unlawful aid is incompatible with the common market, Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 provides that the Commission will decide that the Member State concerned should take all necessary measures to recover the aid from the beneficiary.
The total amount of aid to be recovered comprises amounts paid in the form of exemption from payment of a levy on meat purchases in favour of certain undertakings marketing meat during the period concerned. (250) Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 provides for the aid to be recovered to include interest at an appropriate rate fixed by the Commission.
The State aid scheme in favour of rendering undertakings, livestock farmers and slaughterhouses which France implemented between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2000 to fund the public rendering service, financed by a levy on meat purchases and on products coming from other Member States, is compatible with the common market under Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty, on condition that France fulfils the undertakings set out in paragraph 4 of this Article. 2.

France shall reimburse the persons liable for payment of the levy on meat purchases the part levied on meat coming from other Member States between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2000.
This shall be done in full compliance with the following conditions: - France shall notify the persons liable for payment of the levy individually, within a maximum of six months from the date of notification of this decision, of their individual right to reimbursement, - in order to submit a request for reimbursement the persons liable for payment of the levy shall be given a period that complies with national law, and in any case not less than six months, - reimbursement shall be made within a maximum period of six months from the date of submission of the request, - the amounts reimbursed shall be updated to take account of interest from the date on which they were levied up to the date of actual reimbursement.
The interest shall be based on the Commission reference rate calculated by the method used for setting the reference and discount rates, - the French authorities shall accept any reasonable evidence from the parties liable for payment showing the part of the levy paid on meat coming from other Member States, - the right to reimbursement may not be made subject to other conditions, in particular that of not having passed on the levy, - where a levy payer has not yet paid the levy, the French authorities shall formally waive their right to payment of it, including any interest on arrears, - the French authorities shall send the Commission, within a maximum period of 20 months from the date of notification of this decision, a full report showing that this Article has been properly implemented. 5.
The State aid scheme which France implemented between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2002 in favour of rendering undertakings to finance the public rendering service, financed by a levy on meat purchases, is compatible with the common market under Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty. 2.
