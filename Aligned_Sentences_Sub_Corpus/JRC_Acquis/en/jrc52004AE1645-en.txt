Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the &amp;lsquo;Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the access to Community External Assistance&amp;rsquo;(COM(2004) 313 final &amp;mdash; 2004/0099 (COD)) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the "Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the access to Community External Assistance" (COM(2004) 313 final — 2004/0099 (COD)) (2005/C 157/18) On 15 August 2004, the Council decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 262 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned proposal.
At its 413th plenary session on 15 and 16 December 2004 (meeting of 15 December 2004), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 145 votes in favour with five abstentions. 1.
The underlying purpose of the DAC recommendation is to cut aid transaction costs by 15-30 %.
According to World Bank data, complete untying of aid could reduce these costs by 25 %. 1.4 In the Community context, this approach was adopted at the March 2002 General Affairs Council held in parallel with the Barcelona European Council in preparation for the Monterrey international conference on financing for development.
The Council, and subsequently the Parliament (Report on the Communication from the Commission to the Council and to the European Parliament on Untying: Enhancing the effectiveness of aid COM(2002) 639 final — 2002/2284 (INI) A5-0190/2003) support untying on the basis of three conditions to be met: regional and interregional integration, institutional and capacity building in the recipient countries and avoidance of distortion of competition between donor and recipient countries.
Article 4 of the regulation should contain an explicit statement to this effect. 3.6 The dead weight of tied assistance is universally considered as one of the constraints imposed by the prevailing model of development cooperation, reducing its effectiveness and undermining its credibility by giving priority to "donor" goods and services.
