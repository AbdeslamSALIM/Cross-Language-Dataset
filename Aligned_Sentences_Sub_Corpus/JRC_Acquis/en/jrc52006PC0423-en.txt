The inclusion of a substance on one of these lists means that its use is authorised in general for all operators on the Community market. | 120 | ( General context So as to meet the objectives set in the White Paper, and for reasons of efficiency in the areas of food safety, human health protection and the free movement of the products concerned, the Commission has developed, in parallel, three other proposals for Regulations that make the placing on the Community market of these substances subject to compliance with harmonised criteria and the granting of authorisation: 1.
Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on food additives; 2.
Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on food enzymes; 3.
The new regulatory framework proposed for the substances in question must be completed by the establishment of a common authorisation procedure, insofar as the existence of different national authorisation procedures could potentially lead to different results and, in consequence, hinder the free movement of the substances concerned and distort free competition. | 130 | ( Existing provisions in the area of the proposal 1.
Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 October 1996 laying down a Community procedure for flavouring substances used or intended for use in or on foodstuffs.
Unlike the current proposal, it does not make provision for private operators to submit authorisation requests; it involves the creation of a positive list of flavouring substances without making provision for the list to be updated; the existing procedure lacks clarity in relation to new substances and the deadlines for the various stages of the procedure. | 140 | ( Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union The proposed Regulation not only falls within the general framework of the Lisbon Strategy but also fulfils the Commission’s objectives as regards simplification and “Better Regulation”. | 2) CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | ( Consultation of interested parties | 211 | Consultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents The consultation methods and the organisations consulted are described in detail in the explanatory memorandums of the proposals for regulations on additives, enzymes and flavourings. | 212 | Summary of responses and how they have been taken into account The parties consulted welcomed the idea of a simplified, transparent and expedient common authorisation procedure.
Moreover, the codecision procedure currently applicable in relation to additives is an isolated case in food legislation as a whole, despite its use not being justified by a higher level of risk posed by additives. | ( Collection and use of expertise | 229 | No recourse to external expertise was necessary. | 230 | ( Impact assessment This proposal and the options considered have no environmental impact. 1.
This situation could undermine consumer confidence. 3.
The Regulation envisaged will lead to the Member States’ legal provisions concerning the use of food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings being harmonised in the form of a positive list of authorised substances to be created by the Commission pursuant to the Regulation. | 320 | ( Subsidiarity principle The principle of subsidiarity applies insofar as the proposal does not concern an area in which the Community has exclusive competence. | The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States for the following reasons. | 321 | This proposal aims to establish a centralised authorisation procedure at Community level.
A Community measure on the authorisation procedure complements the other three harmonisation measures proposed in this area. | 323 | Putting in place authorisation procedures separately in each Member State would make the authorisation mechanisms considerably more unwieldy and would create needless additional administrative burdens for the competent authorities of the Member States and for operators. | The objectives of the proposal can be better achieved by Community action for the following reasons. | 324 | Community action in relation to the authorisation procedure for the substances in question is more effective than action taken by the Member States insofar as it will fully benefit all operators that market the products concerned on the Community market as well as consumers, who will be able to enjoy the same level of protection in all Member States. | 325 | Community action in the area envisaged brings added value as regards legal certainty and efficiency for operators in the sector, administrative simplification, the functioning of the internal market and consumer protection. | 327 | The proposal relates exclusively to the intrinsic elements of a centralised authorisation procedure. | The proposal therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle. | ( Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the principle of proportionality for the following reasons. | 331 | The proposed measure is procedural in nature and follows from the principle of pre-marketing authorisation that is established in the sectors concerned.
The proposed act does not exceed the limits of what is appropriate and necessary in order to achieve the legitimate objective of the legislation in question, namely the proper functioning of the internal market and human health protection. | 332 | The procedures put in place by the proposed measure streamline the processing of authorisation files, the majority of which (except for enzymes) have already been scientifically assessed by the Authority and processed by the Commission.
The creation and updating of a Community list of authorised substances should also facilitate the movement of the products concerned and increase the level of information in this area. | ( Choice of instruments | 341 | Proposed instrument(s): Regulation. | 342 | Other means would not be adequate for the following reasons.
A different solution (directive, code of conduct, guidelines) would make the authorisation procedure for the substances concerned considerably more unwieldy and would not offer the necessary legal certainty. | 4) BUDGETARY IMPLICATION | 409 | The proposal has no implication for the Community budget. | 5) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION | 510 | ( Simplification | 511 | The proposal simplifies the legislative framework, the administrative procedures applicable to (national or European) public authorities and the administrative procedures applicable to bodies and private individuals. | 512 | A single regulation will set out the applicable procedure for the authorisation of additives, enzymes and flavourings. | 513 | The competent authorities of the Member States will be able to follow all the stages of the authorisation procedure without being burdened with needless administrative tasks. | 514 | The operators concerned will benefit fully from the advantages of a centralised, transparent, time-limited procedure.
The granting of authorisation by means of a regulation updating a Community list will significantly speed up the authorisation procedure. | 515 | The proposal is included in the Commission’s programme for updating and simplifying the Community acquis and in its Work and Legislative Programme under the reference 2005/SANCO/034. | 560 | ( European Economic Area This draft act concerns an area covered by the EEA Agreement and must therefore be extended to the European Economic Area. | 570 | ( Detailed explanation of the proposal by chapter or by article Chapter I: General principles A common procedure is established for assessing and authorising additives, enzymes and flavourings.
In consequence, in preparing its opinion, the Authority may use the network made available to it by Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2230/2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 with regard to the network of organisations operating in the fields within the European Food Safety Authority’s mission[7]. (13) The common authorisation procedure for the substances must fulfil transparency and public information requirements while guaranteeing applicants’ right to preserve the confidentiality of certain information. (14) Pursuant to Article 41 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents[8] applies to documents held by the Authority. (15) Articles 53 and 54 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 establish procedures for taking emergency measures in relation to foodstuffs of Community origin or imported from third countries.
They authorise the Commission to adopt such measures in situations where foodstuffs are likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health or the environment and where such risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by measures taken by the Member State(s) concerned. (16) In the interests of efficiency and legislative simplification, there should be a medium-term examination as to whether to extend the scope of the common procedure to other legislation in the area of food. (17) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States on account of differences between national laws and provisions and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
The common procedure shall set the procedural arrangements for updating the lists of substances the marketing of which is authorised in the Community pursuant to Regulation (EC) No XXX/2006, Regulation (EC) No YYY/2006 and Regulation (EC) No ZZZ/2006 (hereinafter referred to as the “sectoral food laws”). 3.
The criteria according to which substances can be included on the Community list provided for in Article 2, the content of the Regulation referred to in Article 7 and, where applicable, the transitional provisions concerning ongoing procedures are laid down in each sectoral food law.
Applications may be made by a Member State or by an interested party, who may represent several interested parties, according to the conditions provided for by the implementing measures referred to in Article 9(1)(a) (hereinafter referred to as “the applicant”). 2.
The Commission shall seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter referred to as “the Authority”) in advance, in accordance with Article 5.
The common procedure shall end with the adoption by the Commission of a regulation implementing the update, in accordance with Article 7. 4.
Article 5 Opinion of the Authority 1.

The regulation shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2).
In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2), within a period of no longer than 24 months from the adoption of each sectoral food law, the implementing measures for this Regulation shall be adopted, and shall concern in particular: a) the content, drafting and presentation of the application referred to in Article 4(1); b) the arrangements for checking the validity of applications; c) the type of information that must be included in the opinion of the Authority referred to in Article 5. 2.
Article 11 Transparency The Authority shall ensure the transparency of its activities in accordance with Article 38 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.
Article 12 Confidentiality 1.
The implementation of paragraphs 1 to 6 shall not affect the circulation of information between the Commission, the Member States and the Authority.
Article 13 Emergencies In the event of an emergency concerning a substance on the Community list, particularly in the light of an opinion of the Authority, measures shall be adopted in accordance with the procedures referred to in Articles 53 and 54 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.
Article 14 Committee 1.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health established by Article 58 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002. 2.
