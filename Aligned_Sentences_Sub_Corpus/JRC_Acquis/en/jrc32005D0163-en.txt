2005/163/EC: Commission Decision of 16 March 2004 on the State aid paid by Italy to the Adriatica, Caremar, Siremar, Saremar and Toremar shipping companies (Tirrenia Group) (notified under document number C(2004) 470) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 16 March 2004 on the State aid paid by Italy to the Adriatica, Caremar, Siremar, Saremar and Toremar shipping companies (Tirrenia Group) (notified under document number C(2004) 470) (Only the Italian text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2005/163/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having, pursuant to the aforementioned Articles, called on the parties concerned to submit their comments [1], Whereas: I.
PROCEDURE (1) Following numerous complaints, the Commission decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the Treaty in respect of aid paid to six companies in the Tirrenia Group, namely Tirrenia di Navigazione, Adriatica, Caremar, Saremar, Siremar and Toremar.
In addition, the Tirrenia di Navigazione, Adriatica, Caremar, Saremar, Siremar and Toremar companies brought an action for annulment before the Court of First Instance by virtue of Article 230(4) of the Treaty [4]. (5) During the investigation phase, the Italian authorities asked for the Tirrenia Group case to be split up so that priority could be given to reaching a final decision concerning the Tirrenia di Navigazione company.
These undertakings were formalised by letter ref. 501 dated 29 October 2003, which reached the Commission on 31 October 2003 (A/33506), and confirmed by a letter dated 17 February 2004 (A/13405/04).
In respect of Adriatica, the Italian authorities sent the Commission additional information by fax dated 23 February 2004 (registered under the number A/13970/04).
Until 2000, Adriatica also operated other international routes, namely: - Trieste/Durrës (Albania), - Brindisi/Corfu/Igoumenitsa/Patras (Greece). (10) At the same time, Adriatica operates purely local cabotage connections to the Tremiti islands from the mainland Italian ports of Ortona, Vasto, Termoli, Vieste and Manfredonia. (11) Lastly, Adriatica provides freight services to and from Sicily on the following cabotage routes: - Ravenna/Catania, - Venice/Catania, - Livorno/Catania [6], - Genoa/Termini Imerese [7]. (12) The bulk of Adriatica’s passenger traffic is concentrated on the international connections in the middle and lower Adriatic, especially the connections with Albania (49 % of the company’s overall traffic) and the cabotage connections with the islands of the Tremiti archipelago [8].
Toremar (19) Toremar only operates on the maritime cabotage routes between the mainland and the Tuscan islands (Elba, Gorgona, Capraia, Pianosa and Giglio).
The features of the network of services provided by Toremar make it comparable to a suburban local transport services network [12]. (20) Two of the six routes operated by Toremar are also operated all year round by other Italian operators.
Siremar (21) Siremar operates local connections between the ports of Sicily and the smaller islands around Sicily (Aeolian islands, Pelagian islands, Egadi islands, Ustica and Pantelleria).
This is a purely local network of routes; the — generally short — trips, the frequency of service and the timetable essentially serve the mobility requirements of the islands’ residents. (22) On the connections with the Aeolian islands archipelago and the Egadi islands, Siremar operates in competition with private Italian operators. (23) The Aeolian islands, which are home to 12000 permanent residents, 9000 of them on the main island of Lipari, are served by five connections operated by Siremar from the Sicilian port of Milazzo.
One Italian operator competes with Siremar on four of the five routes, using mixed vessels of modest capacity, while another competes with the high-speed services on three routes in the off-season and four in the high season. (24) Siremar operates year-round connections with the three islands of the Egadi archipelago to the north-west of Sicily from the Sicilian port of Trapani, using one mixed (passenger/vehicle) vessel and two high-speed craft.
Two private Italian operators are present on this market; the first provides a freight-only service while the second provides high-speed services. (25) Siremar faces no competition from private operators on the other routes it operates from the ports of Palermo and Agrigento.
Caremar (26) Caremar operates a network of local maritime connections between the mainland ports of the Gulf of Naples (Naples, Sorrento and Pozzuoli) and the Parthenopean islands (Capri, Ischia, Procida) and between the mainland ports of Formia and Anzio (Lazio) and the minor islands of Ponza and Ventotene.
The services it provides essentially meet the mobility requirements of the local communities. (27) In the Gulf of Naples, Caremar operates in competition with other private Italian operators on the Capri/Naples, Capri/Sorrento, Ischia/Naples and Procida/Naples routes. (28) Caremar faces no competition on the connections it operates with the islands of Ponza and Ventotene, which it serves all year round using mixed passenger/vehicle vessels.
It does face competition, however, from a private operator on the high-speed services it provides on the Ponza/Formia and Ventotene/Formia routes. (29) Again, the network of routes operated by Caremar may be likened to a suburban transport network in terms of frequency and timetable, particularly as regards the Gulf of Naples.
Subsidies paid in respect of public service obligations The legislative framework (30) Article 8 of Law No 684 of 20 December 1974 on the restructuring of shipping services of major national interest (Law No 684/1974) requires maritime connections with the major and minor islands to satisfy requirements relating to the economic and social development of the regions concerned, particularly the Mezzogiorno.
As far as vessels are concerned, the Presidential Decree requires concessionaires to use ships not more than 18 years old, of which they must be the owners, unless this is expressly waived by the Ministry.
Article 5 details the economic parameters used to calculate the various cost elements taken into consideration, pursuant to Presidential Decree No 501/1979, when determining the amount of the subsidy.
The five-year plans (37) Article 1 of the public service agreements provides for five-year plans to specify the routes and ports to be served, the type and capacity of the vessels assigned to the maritime connections in question, the frequency of service and the fares to be paid, including subsidised fares, particularly for residents of the island regions. (38) The first five-year plan (1990-1994) was approved by Ministerial Decree of 29 May 1990, and applied retroactively as of 1 January 1990.
The second plan, covering the period 1995-1999 and approved by Decree of 14 May 1996, left the routes and frequencies largely unchanged. (39) The third plan (covering the period 2000-2004), submitted to the Italian authorities in September 1999, has not yet been approved.
Pending the adoption of this plan, a Decree of 8 March 2000 ordered the companies of the Tirrenia Group to maintain the services specified in Article 9 of Law No 160/1989, using the vessels at their disposal at 31 December 1999.
The net operating loss is derived from the difference between accumulated losses, usually generated during the winter period, and recorded revenue, earned mainly in the summer period. (42) With regard to the return on capital invested, the information supplied by the Italian authorities shows that, as a percentage of such capital, it varies from year to year, ranging from 12,5 % in 1992 to 5,1 % in 2000, in line with the market rates applied in those years. (43) The amount of the subsidy paid to the regional companies of the Tirrenia Group pursuant to the 1991 public service agreements has evolved as follows [13]: (in ITL million) | YEAR | (A) OPERATING COSTS | (B) OPERATING REVENUE | (C) NET LOSS (accumulated losses minus accumulated revenue)(A — B) | RETURN ON CAPITAL INVESTED | AMOUNT OF ANNUAL SUBSIDY | 1992 | – 127018 | 64772 | – 62772 | 8258 | 70504 | 1993 | – 124191 | 79716 | – 44475 | 10615 | 55090 | 1994 | – 158533 | 80324 | – 78209 | 7819 | 86028 | 1995 | – 166334 | 95114 | – 71220 | 9304 | 80524 | 1996 | – 170095 | 95422 | – 74673 | 7935 | 82608 | 1997 | – 174331 | 94995 | – 79336 | 5788 | 85124 | 1998 | – 175809 | 114210 | – 61599 | 5271 | 66870 | 1999 | – 151109 | 126403 | – 24706 | 3646 | 28352 | 2000 | – 137255 | 109786 | – 27469 | 4377 | 31846 | 2001 | – 183820 | 155616 | – 28204 | 6147 | 34351 | The sizeable variations in the amount of the annual subsidy (last column) are explained by the fluctuations in the net operating costs (column C) of the international connections with Albania, Yugoslavia and Croatia, on which services were interrupted on account of the political situation in the Balkans.
In addition, the suspension of services to Greece at the end of 1999 brought an appreciable reduction in operating costs and thus in the size of the balancing subsidy. (in ITL million) | YEAR | (A) OPERATING COSTS | (B) OPERATING REVENUE | (C) NET LOSS (accumulated losses minus accumulated revenue)(A — B) | RETURN ON CAPITAL INVESTED | AMOUNT OF ANNUAL SUBSIDY | 1992 | – 33519,0 | 7464,0 | – 26055,0 | 1342,0 | 27397,0 | 1993 | – 35938,0 | 8365,0 | – 27573,0 | 2641,0 | 30214,0 | 1994 | – 35295,2 | 9383,8 | – 25911,4 | 1606,2 | 27517,6 | 1995 | – 34605,7 | 11396,6 | – 23209,1 | 1781,6 | 24990,7 | 1996 | – 34972,8 | 11533,5 | – 23439,3 | 1560,4 | 24999,7 | 1997 | – 36653,4 | 11746,7 | – 24906,7 | 1172,8 | 26079,5 | 1998 | – 39602,0 | 11744,0 | – 27858,0 | 973,0 | 28831,0 | 1999 | – 40218,8 | 12425,6 | – 27793,2 | 738,8 | 28532,0 | 2000 | – 36300,0 | 12652,0 | – 23648,0 | 828,0 | 24476,0 | 2001 | – 31105,6 | 12487,0 | – 17649,5 | 1094,9 | 18725,1 | The relatively stable level of the annual subsidy (last column) reflects the nature of the market on which Saremar operates, i.e.
The services the company provides have remained largely unchanged — in terms of frequency and timetables — since the public service agreement entered into force [14] and are virtually unchanged throughout any given year. (in ITL million) | YEAR | (A) OPERATING COSTS | (B) OPERATING REVENUE | (C) NET LOSS (accumulated losses minus accumulated revenue)(A — B) | RETURN ON CAPITAL INVESTED | AMOUNT OF ANNUAL SUBSIDY | 1992 | – 43511,0 | 27406,0 | – 16105,0 | 1367,0 | 17472,0 | 1993 | – 44907,0 | 30750,0 | – 14157,0 | 2145,0 | 16302,0 | 1994 | – 47696,6 | 32759,0 | – 14937,0 | 1312,1 | 16249,1 | 1995 | – 47900,0 | 32000,0 | – 15900,0 | 1400,0 | 17300,0 | 1996 | – 50516,1 | 32483,3 | – 18032,8 | 1285,0 | 19317,8 | 1997 | – 48900,0 | 31200,0 | – 17700,0 | 900,0 | 18600,0 | 1998 | – 50801,0 | 29996,0 | – 20805,0 | 718,0 | 21523,0 | 1999 | – 47840,1 | 32362,0 | – 15478,1 | 588,1 | 16066,2 | 2000 | – 45675,0 | 34577,0 | – 11098,0 | 1993,0 | 13091,0 | 2001 | – 44903,1 | 35573,5 | – 9329,6 | 3033,5 | 12363,2 | The essentially local market on which Toremar operates explains the relatively stable level of the annual subsidy over the years (last column).
The services the public company provided in 2000 were the same — in terms of frequency and timetables — as those provided in 1992 [15] and are unchanged throughout the year irrespective of seasonal variations in demand. (in ITL million) | YEAR | (A) OPERATING COSTS | (B) OPERATING REVENUE | (C) NET LOSS (accumulated losses minus accumulated revenue)(A — B) | RETURN ON CAPITAL INVESTED | AMOUNT OF ANNUAL SUBSIDY | 1992 | – 79543,0 | 26903,0 | – 52640,0 | 2874,0 | 55514,0 | 1993 | – 75845,0 | 30444,0 | – 45401,0 | 5334,0 | 50735,0 | 1994 | – 78549,7 | 32845,7 | – 45704,0 | 3336,0 | 49040,0 | 1995 | – 80947,5 | 33847,0 | – 47100,5 | 4363,7 | 51464,2 | 1996 | – 85934,6 | 32724,0 | – 53210,6 | 3888,4 | 57099,0 | 1997 | – 97536,9 | 35203,2 | – 62333,4 | 3155,1 | 65488,5 | 1998 | – 106563,1 | 37244,8 | – 69318,3 | 2599,3 | 71917,6 | 1999 | – 110611,1 | 40274,2 | – 70336,9 | 2211,2 | 72548,1 | 2000 | – 102881,0 | 43335,0 | – 59546,0 | 3940,0 | 63486,0 | 2001 | – 106490,0 | 47314,4 | – 59175,6 | 4249,9 | 63425,5 | The services provided by Siremar are comparable in nature to those provided by Saremar and Toremar: supply has been stable since the public service agreement entered into force [16] and is scarcely affected by seasonal variations.
The company’s high operating costs, entailing a huge annual subsidy, are explained in particular by the number of routes it operates (18 scheduled routes) in order to meet the mobility requirements of the inhabitants of the 14 islands situated off Sicily.
This large number of scheduled services means that major operating costs (staff, fuel, maintenance, etc.) are incurred in guaranteeing the large number of trips the company carries out each year [17]. (in ITL million) | YEAR | (A) OPERATING COSTS | (B) OPERATING REVENUE | (C) NET LOSS (accumulated losses minus accumulated revenue)(A — B) | RETURN ON CAPITAL INVESTED | AMOUNT OF ANNUAL SUBSIDY | 1992 | – 59987,0 | 20543,0 | – 39444,0 | 26,0 | 39470,0 | 1993 | – 63737,0 | 22810,0 | – 40927,0 | 1538,0 | 42465,0 | 1994 | – 69365,7 | 25470,0 | – 43894,8 | 1690,0 | 45584,8 | 1995 | – 71389,6 | 24519,9 | – 46869,7 | 2173,2 | 49042,9 | 1996 | – 71404,3 | 26613,7 | – 44790,6 | 1867,4 | 46658,0 | 1997 | – 73752,0 | 30420,0 | – 43332,0 | 1516,9 | 44848,9 | 1998 | – 77143,0 | 31920,0 | – 45223,0 | 1287,0 | 46510,0 | 1999 | – 74172,0 | 30896,5 | – 43275,5 | 986,6 | 44262,3 | 2000 | – 70114,0 | 32594,0 | – 37520,0 | 2291,0 | 39818,0 | 2001 | – 68316,8 | 33377,9 | – 34938,9 | 3366,5 | 38305,4 | The stability of the annual subsidy is explained by the nature of the network of services Caremar provides; these services have remained largely unchanged since the agreement with the State entered into force [18].
Preferential fiscal treatment (47) Decree Law No 504 of 26 October 1995 introduced preferential fiscal arrangements for mineral oils used as fuel for shipping.
Comments from private operators (51) The Commission received comments from various private operators competing on a number of the routes served by Caremar, Saremar and Toremar.
These can be summarised as follows: - the Tirrenia Group companies practise an aggressive commercial policy on the routes on which competition from private operators is focused, taking the form of voyages at dumped prices, discounts and deferred payment systems, the only explanation for which is the public aid they receive, - the public service obligations lack transparency, and the Tirrenia Group companies’ ability to alter the extent of the obligations imposed on them, particularly in terms of the routes they serve and the imposed timetables and frequencies, is contrary to the very nature of public service obligations, - given that services are being provided by private operators on certain routes served by the Tirrenia Group companies, the need for a public service seems highly debatable, - the financing arrangements for investments carried out since 1995, or scheduled in the business plan, contain elements of aid, particularly as regards two vessels acquired by Viamare in 1996 and more generally in terms of the more favourable access to bank loans enjoyed by the Tirrenia Group companies, - the Tirrenia Group companies enjoy preferential fiscal treatment for mineral oils used on board their vessels when laid up in Italian ports.
COMMENTS FROM THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES Subsidies paid in respect of public service obligations (52) By letter dated 29 September 1999, the Italian authorities supplied their comments on the decision to initiate the procedure.
The investment scheduled in the business plan (55) The Italian authorities stress that the investment scheduled in the business plan is designed to reduce the cost of services while maintaining a high level of quality.
The information supplied to the Commission shows that, through a general decision of 2 March 1996 taken pursuant to Decree Law No 504/1995, the preferential fiscal treatment provided for by the Decree Law was extended to fuels and lubricants used by any vessel laid up in a port for maintenance operations. (57) At the same time, Italy lodged an appeal before the Court of Justice against the decision to initiate the procedure, in respect of the part stipulating that the grant of unlawful aid be suspended [21].
The existence of an actual public service obligation [23] is examined in recitals 84 to 122, - the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner, to avoid it conferring an economic advantage which may favour the recipient undertaking over competing undertakings.
In the case in question, the Commission notes that Article 5 of the agreements details the economic parameters used to calculate the various cost elements taken into consideration, pursuant to Presidential Decree No 501/1979, to determine the compensation, - the compensation cannot exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in the discharge of public service obligations, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit for discharging those obligations.
Nor do the information and data supplied by the Italian authorities and the recipients serve to establish whether this condition is satisfied. (60) In view of the above considerations and those set out below concerning the existence of an actual public service requirement, the Commission considers that the annual balancing subsidy granted to the regional companies under the 1991 agreements confers an advantage on those companies over competing companies which provide or could provide comparable services on the relevant market. (61) In terms of impact on intra-Community trade and distortion of competition, these are evident in the case of transport between Member States, or between Member States and third countries, liberalised by Council Regulation (EEC) No 4055/86 of 22 December 1986 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport between Member States and between Member States and third countries [24]. (62) Although it is cabotage services that are at issue, the Court has noted [25] that it is not impossible that a public subsidy granted to an undertaking which provides only local or regional transport services and does not provide any international transport services may none the less have an effect on trade between Member States. (63) Where a Member State grants a public subsidy to an undertaking, the provision of transport services by that undertaking may for that reason be maintained or increased with the result that undertakings established in other Member States have less chance of providing their transport services in the market in that Member State [26]. (64) According to the case-law of the Court, the Commission is not required, where aid has been granted unlawfully, to demonstrate the real effect of the aid on competition and on trade between Member States.
Indeed, such an obligation would favour those Member States which granted aid in breach of the duty to notify laid down in Article 88(3) of the Treaty over those which did notify aid at the planning stage [27]. (65) The fact that this market in cabotage connections with the Mediterranean islands was provisionally exempted, up to 1 January 1999, from the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage) does not rule out the possibility that the subsidies paid to the regional companies operating on cabotage routes with the Mediterranean islands pursuant to the agreements could have affected trade between Member States and distorted competition. (66) In any event, even allowing that the aid paid to companies which only operated cabotage transport may not have affected trade or distorted competition prior to 1 January 1999, the situation changed as of that date, when cabotage activity was opened up to all Community operators pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92. (67) In the light of the criteria set out in recitals 58 to 66, it is useful to examine the situation of the regional companies with reference to the markets on which they operate. - With regard to Adriatica, the Commission would point out that, under the agreement, the company operates not only on the cabotage market but also on international routes on which it faces or has faced competition from other Community operators since the agreement entered into force.
In these circumstances, the subsidies paid to Adriatica under the agreement may have affected trade between Member States and distorted competition. - Regarding the four other regional companies, the Commission notes that only Saremar operates on an international route, between Sardinia and Corsica, and that it does so in competition with a private Italian operator.
The fact that this route has been open to potential competition from operators from other Member States since the agreement entered into force suggests that the annual subsidy paid to Saremar to cover the net operating loss of its overall network of connections may, particularly as a result of the lack of separate accounts for the different categories of service, have affected trade between Member States and distorted competition. - With particular regard to Siremar, Toremar and Caremar, the Commission has the following comments: - each of these companies operates solely in one clearly defined segment of the cabotage market with the Mediterranean islands, - until 1 January 1999, cabotage services between the Mediterranean islands were provisionally exempted from application of the principle of freedom to provide services by virtue of Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 [28], - in these various segments of the cabotage market, the regional companies compete on certain routes with private Italian operators, whose presence often predates the entry into force of the agreement; however, none of these operators operates in markets other than the Italian Mediterranean cabotage market, - no operator from another Member State was present in these various cabotage market segments prior to 1 January 1999 and none has entered them since the market was opened up. (68) The fact that a sector has not been liberalised, as in the case of Mediterranean cabotage prior to 1 January 1999, is not always a sufficient condition for ruling out any negative effects on trade between Member States [29]. (69) For one thing, the fact that three Tirrenia Group companies (Tirrenia, Adriatica and Saremar) operated in the transport market between Member States or between these and third countries and that they failed to keep separate accounts for the different categories of service suggests that all the aid they received may have affected trade between Member States and distorted competition.
Moreover, it cannot be ruled out that such effects were produced by all the subsidies granted to the companies in the Group. (70) Also, even before the cabotage market was liberalised, operators from the other Member States were free to exercise their right of establishment and provide cabotage services using ships flying the Italian flag. (71) In any event, the fact that operators from the other Member States were able to provide competing services on the cabotage market in Italy as of 1 January 1999 suggests at least potential effects on trade over the last five years, particularly in the absence of exclusive rights granted to the regional companies under the public service agreements. (72) In view of the above, and particularly given the fact that for the compensation to confer an advantage which may be regarded as "aid" it is sufficient for one of the four stipulated conditions not to be satisfied [30], the Commission considers that all the annual compensation paid to the regional companies by the Italian authorities constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty.
Moreover, it was Decree No 501/79, Law No 856/86 and the 1991 agreements which established in detail various public service obligations, along with the cost elements to be used when calculating the balancing subsidy received by the regional companies. (74) The Commission also notes that it has not approved the aid in question.
The Commission’s Decision of 6 July 1990 to close proceedings C 12/89 (formerly N 444/88) concerning the aid Italy had decided to grant to cover the losses of the Fincantieri company in 1987 and 1988 and concerning Law No 234/89 regulating aid to the shipbuilding industry in Italy [31], as referred to by the recipient companies, only concerned aid to shipyards and not the subsidies covered by the present Decision.
The Court recently indicated that the mere communication of a text to the Commission does not constitute notification within the meaning of Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty [33]. (76) The Commission considers, therefore, that the aid to the regional companies constitutes new aid within the meaning of Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty [34]. (77) Even supposing that the aid to the Siremar, Toremar and Caremar companies, which only performed cabotage transport, did not constitute State aid at the time it was granted, it in any event became new aid as of 1 January 1999 following the liberalisation of transport pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92.
Nor can the aid in question be regarded as facilitating the development of certain activities as specified in (c), since this is aid intended to cover the operating costs of a specific maritime operator and does not form part of a general plan enabling the recipient undertaking to become economically and financially efficient without recourse to further aid. (81) Article 86(2) of the Treaty states that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are subject to the rules contained in the Treaty, in particular to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them.
It is not therefore sufficient in this respect that the companies in question have been entrusted by the public authorities with operating a service of general economic interest; the application of the rules of the Treaty, specifically those of Article 87, must also obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to the company and the interests of the Community must not be affected [38]. (83) To assess whether the subsidies paid to the regional companies under the 1991 agreements qualify for the derogation specified in Article 86(2) of the Treaty, the Commission must first verify the existence and extent of the public service obligations imposed on the companies in order to appraise the need for a public service and for a subsidy to compensate for its cost.
Existence of public service obligations meeting an actual requirement Cabotage connections with the minor Italian islands (84) Cabotage connections fall within the scope of Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 and, for the purpose of examining State aid, the Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport [39].
Point 9 of the previous version of the Community guidelines stipulated that "public service obligations may be imposed for scheduled services to ports serving peripheral regions of the Community or thinly served routes considered vital for the economic development of that region, in cases where the operation of market forces would not ensure a sufficient service level".
It also results from the case-law that public service obligations may only be imposed if they meet a real need which cannot be met by market forces alone [40]. (85) Pursuant to the legal acts and agreements described above, the regional companies serving the minor islands are subject, on all their routes, to a series of obligations regarding ports to be served, voyage frequencies, times of departure and arrival, types of vessel to be used and fares to be charged, all of which obligations the companies would not take on (or would not take on to the same extent or under the same conditions) if they could act solely in their own commercial interest. (86) The purpose of these obligations is to guarantee that the principle of territorial continuity is upheld and that a sufficient number of scheduled maritime services is provided to carry passengers and goods to and from the minor Italian islands, so as to meet the mobility requirements of the local populations and the social and economic development requirements of these island regions.
The international connections (87) International maritime connections fall within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4055/86 of 22 December 1986 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport between Member States and between Member States and third countries [41].
The Regulation does not make express provision for minimum public service obligations to be imposed in order to guarantee maritime connections between Member States or between a Member State and a third country. (88) However, the 2004 Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport [42] do allow public service obligations to be imposed or public service contracts concluded if an international transport service is necessary to meet imperative public transport needs (Section 9).
Point 9 of the 1997 guidelines also authorised aid intended to compensate for public service obligations. (89) Accordingly, the Commission finds that the Community legislation in force allows for public service obligations to be introduced on maritime connections other than domestic connections within a Member State.
Accordingly, for both of these companies and for each of the international connections concerned, examination is required of the grounds justifying the imposition of the public service obligations on the recipient companies and of whether the compensation paid was eligible for the derogation provided for in Article 86(2) of the Treaty. (91) With regard to Saremar, the Commission notes that on the Sardinia/Corsica (Santa Teresa/Bonifacio) route the company makes two round trips a day all year round using a mixed ship with a total capacity of 560 passengers and 51 motor vehicles.
The information supplied by the Italian authorities shows that this connection was expressly requested by the local Sardinian and Corsican communities. (92) During the (middle and high) tourist season, Saremar operates in competition with another Italian operator in a position to alter the capacity and frequency of the services it provides in response to the market situation [43].
Moreover, the operator in question is not consistently present throughout the off-season. (93) It follows from the above that the objective — which is the expression of a legitimate public interest — of providing a year-round scheduled service between two insular regions of the Community and taking account of the needs expressed by the local and regional authorities concerned could not be met by the free play of market forces. (94) With regard to the international connections provided by Adriatica, the Commission has the following comments: (a) the Brindisi/Corfu/Igoumenitsa/Patras maritime connection, which links the central regions of the Community with one of its outlying regions, is of vital importance for commercial and tourist traffic, especially in view of the instability which has made the alternative land links problematic.
In addition, information supplied to the Commission at the meeting of 26 October 2001 (registered under the numbers A/13408/04 and A/13409/04) shows that between 1992 and 1999 Adriatica operated an average of 265 journeys a year on this route, carrying an average of 161440 passengers, 24376 vehicles and 104437 linear metres of cargo.
It must also be noted, as indicated by the Italian authorities in a letter dated 17 February 2004 (registered under the number A/13405/04), that between 1996 and 1999 Adriatica’s competitors did not provide a service offering the same guarantees in terms of the quality of the ships used and, inter alia, the regularity and frequency of service.
Despite the clarifications the Italian authorities supplied on this point by fax dated 24 February 2004 (document registered under number A/13970/04), the need for a subsidy to compensate for the obligation to provide services of general economic interest cannot be accepted if the recipient company engages in anti-competitive behaviour prohibited by Article 81 of the EC Treaty.
Article 5 of the Protocol charges Adriatica di Navigazione and the Albanian company Transship with organising the arrangements for services on the connection.
Despite the fluctuations caused by the Kosovo crisis, traffic has developed considerably since 1994 [47].
This does not apply to the Brindisi/Corfu/Igoumenitsa/Patras connection for the period from January 1992 to July 1994, during which Adriatica was involved in a pact prohibited by Article 81 of the EC Treaty.
The information sent by the Italian authorities (particularly the letter dated 17 February 2004, registered under the number A/13405/04) shows that since 1997 a number of Greek operators have provided services comparable to those offered by Adriatica in terms of regularity of service, capacity, frequency and type of ship.
This conclusion cannot be extended to cover the period from January 1992 to July 1994, during which Adriatica was involved, on this route, in a pact prohibited by Article 81 of the EC Treaty, which fact demonstrates that the aid did not correspond to an actual public service requirement.
However, these operators’ supply cannot be regarded as comparable to Adriatica’s in terms of the regularity, frequency and type of ship stipulated by the Italian authorities in the public service agreement.
Siremar (104) Siremar operates in competition with private Italian operators in the local markets of the Aeolian and Egadi archipelagos and on the connection between Sicily and the island of Pantelleria. (105) The network of connections with and between the Aeolian islands is based on five routes on which Siremar provides daily services all year round using mixed (passenger/cargo) ships and high-speed all-passenger craft.
However, this competitor fails to satisfy all the requirements stipulated by the agreement, particularly in terms of continuous year-round provision of services on all routes and the type of ships used.
It appears, in particular, that the operator in question does not operate the Lipari/Salina and Milazzo/Alicudi connections during the off-season. (106) The network of connections with and between the Egadi islands comprises two routes served by mixed (passenger/cargo) ships and four routes served by high-speed all-passenger craft.
Two private Italian operators are present, one in the freight segment and the other in the high-speed (passenger) segment, though neither of them provides services which satisfy all the requirements of the agreement in terms of routes and types of ship. (107) The information supplied to the Commission indicates that on the Trapani (Sicily)/Pantelleria route Siremar provides daily services all year round in competition with a private Italian operator which only carries vehicles and which for this reason, amongst others, fails to satisfy the service requirements stipulated in the agreement. (108) Moreover, according to a complaint sent to the Commission on 13 August 1999 (registered by DG Transport on 18 August 1999 under the number D 02.308 64296), it would appear that from 1990 to 1999 the private operators connecting the minor Sicilian islands with Sicily and the mainland received subsidies from the Region to provide that service.
These data tend to confirm the need for public subsidies to ensure a satisfactory level of connections with the islands in question. (109) It should also be borne in mind that the Sicily Region, through Regional Law No 12 of 9 August 2002 (sent to the Commission by letter dated 12 September 2002 and registered under the number A/68547 on 22 October 2002), established that, to reinforce the maritime connections with the Sicilian minor islands and in accordance with the mobility requirements of their inhabitants, maritime connection services with the aforementioned islands were to be awarded by means of a tendering procedure for a period of five years.
The Sicilian Regional Department of Transport and Communications subsequently announced an open tendering procedure on 21 October 2002 for the award of maritime connection services of public interest using high-speed passenger craft to and between the Sicilian minor islands. (110) The Commission therefore finds that some of the scheduled maritime services to and between the Sicilian minor islands are currently being awarded according to objective and transparent criteria pursuant to the competition rules laid down by the Community directives on public tenders.
Saremar (111) Saremar operates in competition with private Italian operators on three of the four routes it serves. (112) On the Santa Teresa/Bonifacio route between Corsica and Sardinia, Saremar provides daily connections all year round using a medium-capacity high-speed craft.
The information supplied by the Italian authorities (registered under the numbers A/13350/04, A/13346/04 and A/13356/04) shows, however, that the ships of the private competitors, which the Italian authorities claim receive aid from the local authorities, are more than 20 years old and therefore fail to satisfy the service obligations stipulated in the agreement.
One private operator provides daily services all year round at a frequency comparable to Toremar’s.
The information supplied by the Italian authorities (registered under the number A/12951/04) also shows that the private operator’s ships are more than 20 years old, that the public operator is the only one to guarantee the first and last trips of the day and that as of 2000 the operation of this connection has produced profits which have been deducted from the amount of the annual balancing subsidy. (116) On the connection with the island of Giglio, Toremar operates between three and five trips a day, depending on the time of the year, using a special ship which, in addition to passengers and vehicles, carries energy products.
The information supplied by the Italian authorities nonetheless shows that this operator reduces or suspends its activities during the off-season.
Caremar (117) Caremar faces competition from private Italian operators on the Capri/Sorrento, Capri/Naples, Ischia/Naples and Procida/Naples routes between the peninsula and the islands of the Gulf of Naples (Capri, Ischia and Procida) and on the two routes, Ponza/Formia and Ventotene/Formia, connecting the small islands of Ponza and Ventotene to the mainland. (118) On the Capri/Sorrento route, Caremar provides daily connections all year round using a mixed vessel which it also uses to operate the nearby Capri/Naples route.
Information supplied by the Italian authorities at the meetings of 26 October 2001 and 16 April 2002 (documents registered under the numbers A/13326/04 and A/13330/04) shows that the private operators present on this route only provide their mixed transport services during the high season and do not therefore satisfy all the requirements stipulated by the Italian authorities in terms of regularity of service. (119) On the Capri/Naples route, Caremar competes with private Italian operators in the high-speed segment.
The information supplied by the Italian authorities shows that in this segment of the market the private operators provide services comparable, overall, with those provided by Caremar.
The Commission also notes that the operating loss of these services has been examined for the purpose of calculating the annual balancing subsidy paid to Caremar. (121) In addition, in the light of a complaint sent on 13 August 1999 (registered by DG Transport on 18 August 1999 under the number D 02.308 64296), the Commission has reason to believe that, for the year 1990 at least, the private operators which provided high-speed connection services on a number of routes in the Gulf of Naples, including Naples/Capri, Naples/Ischia, Naples/Sorrento/Capri and Naples/Procida/Ischia, received subsidies from the Campania Region.
These data tend to confirm the need for subsidies to ensure a satisfactory level of public service. (122) On the direct Ponza/Formia and Ventotene/Formia routes, Caremar competes with a private operator in the high-speed segment.
The information supplied by the Italian authorities shows that only Caremar operates every day of the week on the Ventotene/Formia route in accordance with the service regularity requirements stipulated in the agreement.
The problem arises in particular in respect of the Naples/Capri and Naples/Ischia high-speed connections Caremar operates in the Gulf of Naples. (126) In this respect, information sent to the Commission by a number of complainants shows that in March 2002, at the initiative of the Campania Region, the private operators, long present in the Gulf of Naples market, undertook with the regional authorities to provide a year-round service similar to that provided by Caremar, notably on the two routes referred to above, renouncing in advance any financial compensation.
The tables below — which use 2000 as the reference year — give a breakdown of each regional company’s costs taken into consideration for the purpose of calculating the annual compensation.
In this respect, it notes that the regional companies only provide the scheduled services specified in the various five-year plans in terms of regularity, frequency and capacity. (132) For services which the regional companies have been shown to have provided in the face of comparable competition, it needs to be checked whether a negative net operating result has been recorded and taken into account in the calculation of the annual compensation paid to the company concerned. (133) As regards Adriatica, comparable competition from another Community operator can be observed on the Bari/Durrës (Albania) route.
Examination of the operating results shows that the net loss recorded on this route was taken into consideration when calculating the annual compensation.
However, the Commission has already indicated that compensation is not necessary for the period from January 1992 to July 1994, during which Adriatica took part in a prohibited pact. (135) Regarding Siremar, the Commission has already observed (recital 105) that none of the private Italian operators on the local markets served by the public operator provides comparable services all year round capable of meeting all the public service requirements stipulated in the five-year plans. (136) For Saremar, the Commission has found (recital 112) that on the Santa Teresa/Bonifacio route the private competitor does not satisfy the requirements of regularity and continuity of service throughout the year as prescribed by the Italian authorities.
Moreover, on the two cabotage connections on which there is competition from private Italian operators, the Commission has observed (recital 113) that the ships of Saremar’s private competitors fail to satisfy the Italian authorities’ requirements in terms of maximum age. (137) For Toremar, the Commission has noted (recitals 114 to 116) that the private operator which competes with the company on the route between Tuscany and the island of Elba fails to satisfy the Italian authorities’ requirements in terms of the age of the ships. (138) For Caremar, the comparable competition from private Italian operators focuses on the Capri/Naples, Procida/Naples and Ischia/Naples connections, where it is confined to the high-speed passenger transport segment.
In its Decision regarding the Tirrenia di Navigazione company, the Commission acknowledged that these cost elements were directly connected to and strictly necessary for the provision of the public services. (140) The following tables indicate the evolution over time of the regional companies’ costs [51]: Cost elements | 1992 | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | i)Agency commission, etc. | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | ii)Port taxes, etc. | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | iii)Operating costs | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | iv)Depreciation | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | v)Net financial charges | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | vi)Administration | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | vii)Other costs | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Total costs | 127018 | 124191 | 158533 | 166334 | 170095 | 174331 | 179809 | 151109 | 137255 | Cost elements | 1992 | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | i)Agency commission, etc. | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | ii)Port taxes, etc. | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | iii)Operating costs | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | iv)Depreciation | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | v)Net financial charges | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | vi)Administration | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | vii)Other costs | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Total costs | 33519 | 35938 | 35295,2 | 34605,7 | 34972,8 | 36653,4 | 39602,0 | 40218,8 | 36300,0 | Cost elements | 1992 | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | i)Agency commission, etc. | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | ii)Port taxes, etc. | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | iii)Operating costs | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | iv)Depreciation | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | v)Net financial charges | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | vi)Administration | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | vii)Other costs | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Total costs | 43511 | 44907 | 47696,6 | 47900 | 50516,1 | 48900 | 50801 | 47840,1 | 45675 | Cost elements | 1992 | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | i)Agency commission, etc. | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | ii)Port taxes, etc. | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | iii)Operating costs | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | iv)Depreciation | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | v)Net financial charges | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | vi)Administration | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | vii)Other costs | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Total costs | 79543 | 75845 | 78549,7 | 80947,5 | 85934,6 | 97536,9 | 106563,1 | 110611,1 | 102881 | Cost elements | 1992 | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | i)Agency commission, etc. | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | ii)Port taxes, etc. | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | iii)Operating costs | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | iv)Depreciation | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | v)Net financial charges | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | vi)Administration | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | vii)Other costs | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Total costs | 59987 | 63737 | 69365,7 | 71389,6 | 71404,1 | 73752,0 | 77143,0 | 74172,0 | 70114 | (141) The information supplied by the Italian authorities shows that the changes over time in the individual cost elements of the regional companies are due primarily to external factors such as inflation and changes in interest rates, as may be seen from the data in the table below: Year | 1992 | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | Variation in inflation | | 4,2 | 3,9 | 5,4 | 3,9 | 1,7 | 1,8 | 1,6 | | Short-term rates | 14,901 | 14,240 | 10,940 | 11,162 | 9,301 | 7,836 | 6,180 | 3,398 | | Medium and long-term rates | 11,377 | 10,926 | 11,146 | 11,992 | 11,324 | 8,860 | 6,390 | 4,259 | | The change over time in the compensation paid to the regional companies relates directly to changes in each company’s costs, as shown, and revenue (see tables in recital 43), which in turn reflect external factors (e.g.
In addition, the discontinuation of the connections with Greece in 1999 brought an appreciable reduction in operating costs [53]. (144) For Saremar, the relative stability of operating costs between 1992 and 2000 results from the nature of the services the company provides — essentially cabotage connections between Sardinia and the neighbouring islands — which primarily meet the requirements of the local communities and are therefore not subject to major variations in supply and demand. (145) The same may be said of Toremar, which operates local connections with the islands of the Tuscan archipelago, again subject to few variations in supply and demand. (146) As regards Siremar and Caremar, the rise in operating costs has been paralleled by an increase in revenue from the routes operated by the two companies.
This increase in revenue, which has been greater in the case of Caremar, has allowed the annual subsidy to be kept at a relatively stable level (see tables in recital 43). (147) Regarding return on invested capital, the Commission observes that the Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport [54] state that the amount of subsidy awarded as compensation for public service obligations should take account of a "reasonable return on capital employed", which is applicable in the case under examination.
In this instance, the Commission notes that the return on invested capital ranges, year on year, from 12,5 % in 1992 to 5,1 % in 2000.
The Commission notes that Article 4(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 (maritime cabotage) states that public service contracts may remain in force up to the expiry date, in this instance 31 December 2008. (150) The Commission also notes that, in most cases, the cabotage routes operated by the regional companies connect certain islands to the nearest mainland port and are the only means of ensuring the territorial continuity of the island regions concerned.
Also, the short journey times and the frequency of trips throughout the day mean that the traffic on these maritime connections can often be compared to a suburban land transport network. (151) The Commission further notes that, despite the liberalisation of the Italian cabotage market on 1 January 1999, the regional companies are in most cases competing only with other Italian operators on the markets in question, most of whom were already present on those markets before that date. (152) Given that, the Commission considers that, on the cabotage market, payment of the balancing subsidy to the regional companies has thus far not affected the development of trade to an extent contrary to the interests of the Community.
This could come about if the future application of the agreements were to lead to an increase, on the routes where competition from private operators is concentrated, in the capacity offered by the regional companies under the public service agreement arrangements. (153) On this point, as regards the cabotage connections on which the regional companies face competition from private operators, the information supplied by the Italian authorities shows that at the time the cabotage market was liberalised: - Adriatica held 44 % of the high-speed passenger transport market segment on the connections with and between the islands of the Tremiti archipelago.
On the freight routes between the mainland and Sicily, Adriatica provided around 33 % of the overall supply of services on the Genoa/Termini Imerese route [57] and 60 % on the Ravenna/Catania route.
The Commission notes that, on the latter route, Adriatica’s dominant position did not prevent a new private operator from entering the market in 2001, - Siremar held around 58 % of the passenger transport market in the Aeolian islands archipelago and 52 % of the high-speed market in the Egadi islands archipelago, - Saremar provided 59 % of all passenger transport services on the La Maddalena/Palau route and 53 % on the Carloforte/Calasetta route, - Toremar provided 60 % of all passenger transport services on the Piombino/Portoferraio route and 27 % on the Isola del Giglio/Porto Santo Stefano route, - in the high-speed transport services segment, Caremar carried 17 % of passengers in the Gulf of Naples and 31 % on the connections with the Pontine islands.
The Italian authorities’ undertakings (154) By letter dated 29 October 2003 (registered on 31 October 2003 under the number A/33506), the Italian authorities undertook to make no more payments to Caremar, during the period 2005-2008, of public service compensation to offset its net operating loss on the high-speed Naples/Capri connection.
Consequently, that high-speed connection will be withdrawn from the services Caremar supplies. (155) In the same letter the Italian authorities also undertook, again for the period 2005-2008, to reduce the overall supply of passenger transport services provided by means of high-speed craft (hydrofoils and catamarans) on the Naples/Procida/Ischia route.
Pursuant to the Italian authorities’ undertakings, the reduction in capacity will consist in reducing the number of places provided on the various ships Caremar uses on this route, from 1142260 to 633200 during the winter season and from 683200 to 520400 during the summer season, while maintaining the current number of journeys so as to ensure the mobility of the islands’ residents.
The Italian authorities estimate the overall reduction in capacity at around 45 % in the winter period and around 24 % in the summer period.
By letter dated 17 February 2004 (registered under the number A/13405/04), the Italian authorities also indicated that the reduction concerned the supply of tourist services in respect of which private operators were able to offer comparable services.
In the same letter, the Italian authorities further undertook to keep separate accounts for connections involving a public service. (156) With regard to the undertaking to discontinue the services Caremar provides on the high-speed Naples/Capri connection, the reduction in capacity on the connections with the Parthenopean islands is estimated at 65 % in the winter period and 49 % in the summer period. (157) As already indicated (recitals 117 to 122), on these two connections Caremar provides services comparable overall to those provided by the private Italian companies long present on the Gulf of Naples market, where they operate without receiving compensation equivalent to that received by Caremar. (158) The Commission finds that, on the strength of these undertakings, the Italian authorities will introduce a transparent accounting system and will appreciably reduce Caremar’s market share of cabotage connections in the Gulf of Naples.
The international connections (159) The international maritime connections are fully open to competition; in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 4055/86, they are covered by the principle of freedom to provide services.
Accordingly, the compensation paid to Adriatica and Saremar under the public service agreements for operating the international connections described above (recitals 90 to 95) is such as to affect current or potential competition from other Community operators.
The Commission therefore needs to ascertain whether or not this compensation has affected trade to an extent contrary to the common interest. (160) On this matter, in the light of the information supplied by the Italian authorities, the Commission notes the following: - the number of passengers carried by Saremar on the route between Corsica and Sardinia represents 4,4 % of the total number of passengers carried by the company on all the routes it operates and 43 % of the passengers carried on the route in question (the other 57 % are carried by the private competitor).
In view of the features of the connection in question (see recitals 91 to 93), and especially the purely local interest and limited development potential, the Commission considers that the compensation paid to Saremar to operate this route has not affected trade to an extent contrary to the common interest, - on the Brindisi/Corfu/Igoumenitsa/Patras route, Adriatica made 140 journeys in 1999, the last year in which it operated the connection, carrying 10 % of the passengers travelling on the route.
In 1998, Adriatica held 12 % of the mixed transport market on this route.
In view of the features of the connection in question (see recital 94), the Commission considers that the compensation paid to Adriatica to operate this route has not affected trade to an extent contrary to the common interest.
The same may not be said in respect of the period from January 1992 to July 1994, during which Adriatica and its competitors were involved in a pact fixing the tariffs to be applied to commercial vehicles.
Investment scheduled in the five-year plans and the business plan (161) With regard to the investment scheduled in the five-year plans, the Commission, in its decision initiating the investigation procedure, expressed doubts regarding the financing arrangements for the investments needed in order to provide the services subsidised under the 1991 agreements.
This obligation, which constitutes a public service obligation, has led the regional companies to renew a substantial part of their fleet over the last few years, given the age reached by the vessels used on the routes covered by the first five-year plan (1990 to 1994).
Consequently, this advantage, which is an integral part of the public service agreement, qualifies for the exemption provided for in Article 86(2) of the Treaty. (165) Regarding the depreciation costs of the ships used by the regional companies on the routes covered by the five-year plans, the Commission notes that these are one of the cost elements which, under the terms of Article 5 of the agreement, enter into the calculation of the annual subsidy.
As the depreciation of vessels used to serve connections recognised by the Italian authorities as being of general interest is calculated according to criteria laid down in the agreements, and as examination of the analytical accounts of these routes has revealed no element of overcompensation in this respect in the two five-year periods considered, the Commission considers that the mechanism the agreements introduced to take vessel depreciation into account when calculating the annual compensation may be authorised under Article 86(2) of the Treaty.
The provision of services recognised as being of general interest presupposes the use of vessels of a type and capacity specified in advance by the public authorities and whose depreciation may thus be taken into account when calculating the annual compensation provided that the vessels in question were acquired by the company under normal market conditions and in order to perform the tasks entrusted to it and are used exclusively for scheduled transport services on the routes covered by the agreement.
Compatibility with other provisions of Community law (167) The case-law has consistently indicated that it is clear from the general scheme of the Treaty that the Article 88 procedure must never produce a result which is contrary to the specific provisions of the Treaty.
When adopting a decision on the compatibility of aid with the common market, the Commission must be aware of the risk of individual traders undermining competition in the common market [63]. (168) As already pointed out, between January 1992 and July 1994 Adriatica took part in a pact to fix the tariffs for commercial vehicles on the Brindisi/Corfu/Igoumenitsa/Patras route, in contravention of Article 81 [64], at the same time as it was receiving aid to operate that route.
Future application of the compensation mechanism (169) The Commission notes that the current compensation system is due to be applied until the end of 2008.
With regard to Caremar, the Commission notes that, by letter dated 17 February 2004 (registered under the number A/13405/04), the Italian authorities made an undertaking to that effect.
Secondly, any permanent change, whether partial or total, to the services offered by Adriatica, Siremar, Saremar, Toremar or Caremar such as would entail an increase in the aid must be notified to the Commission in advance.
CONCLUSIONS (171) On the basis of the above considerations, the Commission finds that no doubts remain as to the compatibility of the aid paid to the regional companies from January 1992 onwards under the 1991 agreements, except as regards the aid granted to the Adriatica company for the period from January 1992 to July 1994 for the Brindisi/Corfu/Igoumenitsa/Patras connection, which is incompatible with the common market on three counts, each of which is sufficient in itself to justify that conclusion: firstly, it did not meet an actual public service requirement; secondly, it affected the development of trade to an extent contrary to the common interest; thirdly, it was closely connected to a pact prohibited by Article 81 of the EC Treaty.
Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 2, the aid granted by Italy to Adriatica as of 1 January 1992 as compensation for providing a public service is compatible with the common market having regard to Article 86(2) of the Treaty. 2.
The aid granted to Adriatica for the period from January 1992 to July 1994 in relation to the Brindisi/Corfu/Igoumenitsa/Patras connection is incompatible with the common market. 3.
The aid granted by Italy to Caremar as of 1 January 1992 as compensation for providing a public service is compatible with the common market having regard to Article 86(2) of the Treaty. 2.
Italy shall give an undertaking that, by no later than 1 September 2004, it will: (a) abolish the aid granted to Caremar for the provision of scheduled high-speed passenger transport services on the Naples/Capri route; (b) reduce, in terms of places on offer, the capacity of the scheduled high-speed passenger transport services on the Naples/Procida/Ischia route from 1142260 to 633200 places during the winter period and from 683200 to 520400 places during the summer period; (c) limit the aid granted to Caremar for the provision of scheduled high-speed passenger transport services on the Naples/Procida/Ischia route to covering the net operating loss on the services; (d) have separate accounts kept for all the public service activities imposed by Italy on Caremar on each of the routes concerned.
Article 4 The capacity reduction undertakings specified in Article 3 shall be included in the interministerial decree adapting the regional companies’ five-year plan for the period 2005 to 2008.
Article 5 The Commission shall be notified in advance of any permanent change, whether partial or total, to the level of services offered by Adriatica, Siremar, Saremar, Toremar or Caremar such as would entail an increase in the aid.
Article 6 Italy shall inform the Commission, within two months of notification of this Decision, of the measures taken to comply with it.
