The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. | Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: | 331 | the formal repeal of a directive that is not time-limited per se can only take place through the adoption of a legislative act; | 332 | repeal will have no financial impact. | Choice of instruments | 341 | Proposed instrument(s): Directive. | 342 | Other means would not have been appropriate for the following reasons: By analogy, the proposal for a directive is based on the same Treaty provisions as the Directive that is due to be repealed.
Article 3 This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 4 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
