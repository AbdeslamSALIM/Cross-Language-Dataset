Article 2 Member States shall ensure that laboratories carrying out official controls on the presence of animal constituents in feedingstuffs participate periodically in proficiency testing on the analytical methods, and that laboratory personnel carrying out analyses receive adequate training.
Article 3 Directive 98/88/EC is repealed.
Article 5 This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 6 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Done at Brussels, 23 December 2003.
Furthermore, a variant protocol may be used when examining certain specific animal constituents such as plasma or bones in tallow (see also point 9), provided that these analyses are made in addition to the analyses foreseen in the coordinated inspection programme. 2.
Feed with an amount of moisture higher than 14 % shall be dried (condensed) prior to handling.
The identification has to be done both on the sieve fraction (6.1) and the concentrated sediment (6.2) of the sample. 4.
Embedding agent 4.1.1.
Chloral hydrate (aqueous, 60 % w/v) 4.1.2.
Paraffin oil or glycerol (viscosity: 68-81) for microscopic observations in the sediment 4.2.
Rinsing agents 4.2.1.
Tetrachloroethylene (density 1,62) 4.4.
Staining reagents 4.4.1.
Iodine/potassium iodide solution (Dissolve 2 g potassium iodide in 100 ml water and add 1 g iodine while shaking frequently) 4.4.2.
Alizarin Red (Dilute 2,5 ml 1M hydrocloric acid in 100 ml water and add 200 mg alizarine red to this solution) 4.4.3.
Cystine reagent (2 g lead acetate, 10 g NaOH/100 ml H2O) 4.4.4.
Bleaching reagent 4.5.1.
Commercial sodium hypochlorite solution (9.6 % active chlorine) 5.
Analytical balance (accuracy of 0,01 g except for the concentrated sediment: 0,001 g) 5.2.
Sieve fitted with sieve mesh with square meshes of width of 0,50 mm maximum 5.4.
At least 50 g of the sample shall be treated (ground with care using the suitable grinding equipment (5.2) if necessary in order to achieve an appropriate structure).
From the ground material two representative portions shall be taken, one for the sieve fraction (at least 5 g) (6.1) and one for the concentrated sediment (at least 5 g) (6.2).
Identification of constituents of animal origin from the concentrated sediment At least 5 g (accurate to 0,01 g) of the sample shall be transferred into a separation funnel or conical bottomed settling beaker and treated with at least 50 ml of tetrachloroethylene (4.3.1).
The total sediment shall be dried and subsequently weighed (accurate to 0,001 g).
The dried sediment shall be examined for bone constituents under the stereomicroscope (5.5) and the compound microscope (5.6). 6.3.
Estimated value of the percentage of bone fragments % terrestrial bone fragments = (S × c)/W % fish bone and scale fragments = (S × d)/W (S = sediment weight (mg), c = correction factor (%) for the estimated portion of terrestrial animal bones in the sediment, d = correction factor (%) for the estimated portion of fish bones and scale fragments in the sediment, W = weight of the sample material for the sedimentation (mg)). 7.2.
With regard to the presence of constituents derived from terrestrial animals: - As far as was discernible using a microscope, no constituents derived from terrestrial animals were found in the submitted sample, or: - As far as was discernible using a microscope, constituents derived from terrestrial animals were found in the submitted sample. 8.2.
In case constituents derived from fish or terrestrial animals are found, the report of the examination result, if required, can further indicate an estimation of the amount of constituents detected (x %, %amp%lt; 0,1 %, 0,1-0,5 %, 0,5-5 % or %amp%gt; 5 %), further specification of the type of terrestrial animal if possible and the animal constituents identified (muscle fibres, cartilage, bones, horn, hair, bristles, feathers, blood, egg shells, fish bones, scales).
Optional protocol for analysing fat or oil The following protocol may be used for the analysis of fat or oil: - If the fat is solid, it is warmed for example in a microwave oven until it is liquid. - Using a pipette, 40 ml of fat is transferred from the bottom of the sample to a centrifugation tube. - Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4000 rpm. - If the fat is solid after centrifugation, it is warmed once more in an oven until it is liquid.
As an embedding agent for microscopy, paraffin oil or glycerol is recommended. - The remaining impurities are used for sedimentation as described in point 6.2. (1) OJ L 102, 15.4.1976, p. 1.
