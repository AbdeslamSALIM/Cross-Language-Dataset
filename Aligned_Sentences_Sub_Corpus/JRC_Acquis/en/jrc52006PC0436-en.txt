Proposal for a Council Regulation imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain side-by-side refrigerators originating in the Republic of Korea /* COM/2006/0436 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 31.7.2006 COM(2006) 436 final Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain side-by-side refrigerators originating in the Republic of Korea (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal This proposal concerns the application of Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community, as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2117/2005 of 21 December 2005 (‘the basic Regulation’). | General context This proposal is made in the context of the implementation of the basic Regulation and is the result of an investigation which was carried out in line with the substantive and procedural requirements laid out in the basic Regulation. | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal Not applicable. | Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. | CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | Consultation of interested parties | Interested parties concerned by the proceeding have already had the possibility to defend their interests during the investigation, in line with the provisions of the basic Regulation. | Collection and use of expertise | There was no need for external expertise. | Impact assessment This proposal is the result of the implementation of the basic Regulation.
The basic Regulation does not foresee a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. | LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | Summary of the proposed action On 2 June 2005, the Commission initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain side-by-side refrigerators originating in the Republic of Korea.
PROVISIONAL MEASURES 2.
On 2 June 2005, the Commission published a notice[2] initiating an anti-dumping proceeding on imports into the Community of certain side-by-side refrigerators originating in the Republic of Korea.
On 1 March 2006, the Commission, by Regulation (EC) No 355/2006[3] (‘the provisional Regulation’) imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on the same product.
SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE 3.
The same exporting producer as referred to under recitals (11) and (12) of the provisional Regulation reiterated and elaborated further its arguments on the issue of the product scope. 8.
In particular, this exporter claimed that the product scope should have covered all large capacity combined refrigerator-freezers (‘CRF’) with a capacity above 400 litres since a segmentation of those refrigerators would be inconsistent with the past practice of the Community institutions, would disregard evidence from other interested parties and would ignore market reality (claim (i)). 9.
However, the fact that this manufacturer has allegedly suffered such a knock-on effect is not in itself conclusive evidence that all large capacity CRFs with a capacity above 400 litres should be considered to be the product concerned regardless of the segments as described above into which they fall.
The Commission was informed that inner compartments were placed differently in a typical side-by-side refrigerator and in a three-door model, but this distinction was not considered decisive for the exclusion of three doors side-by-side refrigerators from the product definition since no conclusive evidence had been submitted in this respect.
Claim (ii) was therefore accepted. 17.
Therefore, the product concerned is definitively defined as combined refrigerator-freezers with a capacity exceeding 400 litres and with the freezer and refrigerator compartments placed side-by-side, originating in the Republic of Korea, currently classifiable within CN code ex 8418 10 20.
Normal value 18.
In the absence of any comments, the content of recitals (18) to (22) of the provisional Regulation concerning normal value is hereby confirmed. 2.
Export Price 19.
In this export price construction, a profit margin of a company which was considered to be an independent importer of the product concerned had been used.
Consequently, it was decided that its profit margin could not be used in the construction of the export prices.
Therefore, in view of the fact the two products pertain to the same white goods sector and the Korean exporting producers concerned being the same, it was considered reasonable to revert for this purpose to the 5% profit margin used in the microwave ovens anti-dumping proceeding[4]. 20.
In the absence of any further comments, the contents of recitals (23) to (24) of the provisional Regulation concerning the determination of the export price are hereby confirmed. 3.
It was therefore decided to construct normal values for this company in cases where no direct comparison between exported models and domestically sold models could be made, in accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation. 24.
Therefore, this claim was accepted. 26.
Dumping margin 28.
In the light of the above adjustments, and after correction of some calculation errors, the amount of dumping finally determined, expressed as a percentage of the CIF net free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, is as follows: Daewoo Electronics Corporation | 3,4% | LG Electronics Corporation | 12,2% | Samsung Electronics Corporation | de minimis | E.
On this basis, the volume of dumped imports increased sharply (by 266 %) between 2002 and the IP.
During the IP, the volume of dumped imports stood between 180 000 and 250 000 pieces. 34.
The corresponding market share held by dumped imports increased by around 20 percentage points between 2002 and the IP, to reach a level between 42 and 50 % during the IP.
Overall, the rise in market shares was 70 % between 2002 and the IP. 35.
Finally, average prices of dumped imports decreased by around 5 % between 2002 and the IP, and on a model-to-model comparison, dumped imports undercut the Community industry’s prices by between 34,4 % and 42 %, depending on the exporter concerned. 36.
The volume of dumped imports of the product concerned originating in the Republic of Korea increased significantly by 266 % between 2002 and the IP and the corresponding market share held by dumped imports increased by around 20 percentage points between 2002 and the IP.
On a model-to-model weighted average comparison, dumped imports undercut the Community industry’s prices by between 34,4 % and 42 %, depending on the exporter concerned, while for some models, price undercutting was even larger. 37.
However, the significant increase in the volume of dumped imports by 266 % between 2002 and the IP, the increase of the corresponding market share by around 20 percentage points, as well as the undercutting found coincided with the deterioration of the economic situation of the Community industry. 2.
The volume of imports originating from Samsung increased by 88 % between 2002 and the IP.
During the IP, the volume of imports originating from Samsung stood between 100 000 and 170 000 pieces. 41.
The corresponding market share held by imports originating from Samsung decreased by around 5 percentage points between 2002 and the IP, to reach a level comprised between 28 % and 36 % during the IP.
In terms of indices, the market share grew by 3 % in 2003, but then declined by 13 percentage points in 2004 and by a further 2 percentage points in the IP.
Overall, the decline in market shares was 12 % between 2002 and the IP. 42.
Finally, average prices of imports originating from Samsung decreased by around 14 % between 2002 and the IP, and on a model-to-model comparison, imports originating from Samsung undercut the Community industry’s prices by 34,1 %. 43.
However, it is also observed that: (i) imports originating from Samsung increased at a far slower pace than other imports originating in the Republic of Korea during the period 2002 to the IP; (ii) in contrast to other Korean imports, imports originating from Samsung lost around 5 percentage points of market share between 2002 and the IP; (iii) the resulting presence, during the IP, of imports originating from Samsung on the Community market in terms of both volume and market share was substantially smaller than that of other Korean imports; and (iv) the model-to-model price comparison showed that Samsung’s prices, albeit lower than those of the Community industry, were consistently higher than those of the other Korean imports. 44.
The impact linked to imports originating from Samsung is therefore considered not sufficient to break the causal link between dumped imports and the resulting injury experienced by the Community industry. 45.
DEFINITIVE MEASURES 47.
The definitive duties will therefore be as follows: Company | Injury margin | Dumping margin | Proposed anti-dumping duty | Daewoo Electronics Corporation | 98,5% | 3,4% | 3,4% | LG Electronics Corporation | 74,8% | 12,2% | 12,2% | Samsung Electronics Corporation | 66,3% | de minimis | 0% | All other companies | 98,5% | 12,2% | 12,2% | J.
A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on side-by-side refrigerators, i.e.
The rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, of the products described in paragraph 1 and produced by the companies listed below shall be as follows: Company | Anti-Dumping duty (%) | TARIC Additional Code | Daewoo Electronics Corporation, 686 Ahyeon-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul | 3,4% | A733 | LG Electronics Corporation, LG Twin Towers, 20, Yeouido-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul | 12,2% | A734 | Samsung Electronics Corporation, Samsung Main Bldg, 250, 2-ga, Taepyeong-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul | 0% | A735 | All other companies | 12,2% | A999 | 3.
The amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duties pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 355/2006 on imports of combined refrigerator-freezers of a capacity exceeding 400 litres, with two doors on the refrigerator compartment above and one door on the freezer compartment below, falling within CN code ex 8418 10 20 and originating in the Republic of Korea shall be released. 3.
Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
