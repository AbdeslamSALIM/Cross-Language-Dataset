2006/262/EC: Commission Decision of 21 September 2005 on State aid No C 5/2004 (ex N 609/2003) which Germany is planning to implement for Kronoply (notified under document number C(2005) 3497) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 21 September 2005 on State aid No C 5/2004 (ex N 609/2003) which Germany is planning to implement for Kronoply (notified under document number C(2005) 3497) (Only the German text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/262/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to those provisions [1] and having regard to their comments, Whereas: 1.
PROCEDURE (1) By letter dated 22 December 2003 (A/39031), Germany notified the Commission that it was planning to award an investment grant to Kronoply GmbH, Heiligengrabe (Brandenburg) (hereinafter "Kronoply") under the multisectoral framework on regional aid for large investment projects [2] ("1998 multisectoral aid framework").
The notified aid was registered under No N 609/03. (2) By letter dated 18 February 2004 (SG/D/200649), the Commission informed Germany of its decision to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty. (3) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union [3].
The Commission called on interested parties to submit their comments. (4) By letter dated 19 March 2004 (A/32003), Germany submitted its comments. (5) By letter dated 24 May 2004 (A/33878), Luther Menold Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft mbH submitted comments on behalf of Kronoply.
The comments were forwarded to Germany on 19 November 2004 (D/58277). 2.
First notification N 813/2000 (6) The present case is related to Case No N 813/2000, in which the Commission approved aid to Kronoply. (7) On 3 July 2001 (SG/D/289524) the Commission approved a gross aid intensity of 31,5% for Kronopoly under the 1998 multisectoral aid framework in connection with the construction of a production plant for Oriented Strand Board [4] ("OSB") in Heiligengrabe, Brandenburg, an assisted area within the meaning of Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty.
The Commission had doubts concerning those studies because the results hinged on exceptionally strong demand growth for 2000 as compared with previous years.
The German Government provided the requested information by letters dated 9 February 2001 (A/31359) and 20 February 2001 (A/31463).
By letter of 9 April 2001 (D/51511), the Commission sent additional questions to which Germany replied on 21 May 2001 (A/34090).
By letter dated 19 June 2001 (A/34812), Germany reduced the notified aid intensity from 35% to 31,5%.
It provided evidence that the growth in demand estimated for 2000 had been achieved and that the market was therefore not in decline.
By letter dated 5 February 2002 (D/50463), the Commission refused to amend its earlier decision because the aid had been assessed on the basis of a correct calculation of all the relevant factors.
Second notification N 609/2003 (11) An attempt was made with the second notification to achieve the maximum intensity of 35%, which had been rejected previously, by granting additional aid equivalent to 3,5% (or €3939947). (12) Germany argued that the market definition given in the original notification N 813/2000 had been factually wrong and referred to Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty [6] ("Regulation (EC) No 659/1999"), which allows the revocation of a decision under the following conditions: "The Commission may revoke a decision taken […] where the decision was based on incorrect information provided during the procedure which was a determining factor for the decision." (13) While the relevant market was defined in the original notification as OSB and plywood, Germany claimed that the newly submitted studies showed that the relevant market was more correctly defined as OSB and only certain segments of plywood.
In the case in point, the aid intensity of 31,5% was sufficient to trigger the investment. 3.
Kronoply had consistently applied for an aid intensity of 35%.
Consequently, there are no new additional eligible costs within the meaning of the regional aid guidelines that might justify the granting of additional aid. (22) The Commission approved investment aid for Kronoply amounting to €35.4 million in its decision SG (2001) D/289524 of 3 July 2001, which was based on the information provided by the German authorities at the time.
It takes the view that the submission of a different market definition by Germany cannot be subsumed under Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999. (24) In line with the judgment of the Court of First Instance in Kronoply, the Commission considers that it is indeed possible for a Member State to notify, and for the Commission to approve, additional aid or a change to an approved project, or even different tranches of state aid for a given project, provided that both the incentive effect and the necessity of the aid can be established for each tranche.
Ex ante assessment of the incentive effect under the regional aid guidelines (28) Point 4.2 of the regional aid guidelines applies the following test to determine whether or not the aid has an incentive effect: the beneficiary must apply for aid before the start of the project.
A full analysis of the economic circumstances of the recipient's investment decision might prove very difficult or time-consuming and might therefore hold up the investment and the economic development of the region. (31) In assessing the presence of the incentive effect for the additional aid corresponding to 3,5 %, the key question is whether the difference between 31,5% and 35% changed the incentive effect and influenced Kronoply’s investment decision: Prior to the investment, Kronoply could not know how much aid it would eventually receive since the assessment of the adjustment factors in the 1998 multisectoral aid framework is at the discretion of the Commission.
Kronoply was unsure therefore whether it would be granted an aid intensity of 31,5% or 35%.
As the aid has been found to be incompatible with Article 87(3)(a) because it neither provides an incentive effect nor is necessary, the aid cannot be declared compatible with Article 87(3)(c) for the same reasons. 6.
Article 2 Germany shall inform the Commission, within two months of notification of this decision, of the measures taken to comply with it.
Article 3 This decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.
