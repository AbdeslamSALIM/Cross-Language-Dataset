It is important that the Community should continue to take part in international trade in the case of certain typical Italian products falling within CN code 02101981. (4) Because of the conditions of competition in certain third countries, which are traditionally importers of products falling within CN codes 160100 and 1602, the refund for these products should be fixed so as to take this situation into account.
The products concerned must comply with the relevant provisions on health marks laid down in: - Chapter XI of Annex I to Directive 64/433/EEC, - Chapter VI of Annex I to Directive 94/65/EC, - Chapter VI of Annex B to Directive 77/99/EEC.
