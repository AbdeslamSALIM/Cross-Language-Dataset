The programme's projections for inflation appear realistic. (3) On 18 January 2005, in its opinion the Council endorsed the budgetary strategy presented in the 2004 update of the convergence programme of Sweden.
Regarding the 2005 budgetary implementation, the 2004 update targeted a 0,6 % of GDP general government surplus for 2005 while the current update forecasts a 1,6 % surplus despite a downward revision of 2005 growth.
To this end it includes a general government surplus objective of 2 % of GDP on average over the cycle, multi-annual nominal ceilings for central government expenditures and a balanced budget balance requirement for local governments.
This update foresees general government surpluses of 1,6 % in 2005, 0,9 % in 2006, 1,2 % in 2007 and 1,7 % in the final year, 2008.
Therefore, 2 % of GDP can be regarded as the programme's medium-term objective (MTO) as it is in line with the principles for MTOs specified in the Stability and Growth Pact and the code of conduct.
Over the programme period, the structural balance calculated according to the commonly agreed methodology is planned to improve from about 1 % of GDP in 2006 to about 1,5-2 % of GDP in 2008. (7) As the MTO is more demanding than the minimum benchmark (estimated at a deficit of about 0,5 % of GDP), its achievement should fulfil the aim of providing a safety margin against the occurrence of an excessive deficit.
Nevertheless, the 2006 budget makes the budget position diverge from the MTO by roughly 1 % of GDP in 2006 and 2007, putting at risk the achievement of the MTO within the programme period.
Moreover, notwithstanding the fact that inflationary pressures are expected to remain subdued, there is a concern that the expansionary fiscal stance in 2006 may not be fully appropriate in the sense that this period may qualify as "good times".
In particular, over the whole programme period there is a sufficient safety margin against breaching the 3 % of GDP threshold for the deficit with normal cyclical fluctuations.
The programme projects the debt ratio to decline to 46 % of GDP by 2008. (11) With regard to the sustainability of public finances, Sweden appears to be at low risk on grounds of the projected budgetary costs of ageing populations.
The currently favourable budgetary position contributes to limiting the projected budgetary impact of ageing populations while the planned consolidation towards the 2 % MTO at the end of the programme period contributes to improve sustainability [3]. (12) The envisaged measures in the area of public finances are broadly consistent with the broad economic policy guidelines included in the integrated guidelines for the period 2005-2008.
While a sufficiently strong medium-term budgetary position is planned to be maintained, in line with the pact, the departure from the ambitious MTO in 2006-2007, as projected in the budget, may risk being pro-cyclical and also put at risk the achievement of the MTO at the end of the programme period. (13) Sweden's National Reform Programme (NRP), submitted on 21 October 2005 within the context of the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs, puts great emphasis on sustainable development and emphasises that the achievement and maintenance of high labour market participation and hours worked are important challenges, and will have a significant impact on public finances in the long term.

Including this impact, the general government balance would be 0,6 % in 2005, -0,1 % in 2006, 0,2 % in 2007 and 0,7 % in 2008, while government gross debt would be 51,4 % in 2005, 49,9 % in 2006, 48,3 % in 2007 and 46,5 % in 2008.
