That register was adopted by Commission Decision 1999/217/EC [2]. (2) In addition, Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 provides for a programme for the evaluation of flavouring substances in order to check whether they comply with the general criteria for the use of flavouring substances set out in the Annex to that Regulation. (3) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 13 July 2004 on para-hydroxybenzoates, that propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (FL 09.915) had effects on sex hormones and the male reproductive organs in juvenile rats.
As a consequence, propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate should be deleted from the register. (4) The Authority concluded in its opinion of 7 December 2004 on aliphatic dialcohols, diketones and hydroxyketones, that pentane-2,4-dione (FL 07.191) is genotoxic in vitro and in vivo.
