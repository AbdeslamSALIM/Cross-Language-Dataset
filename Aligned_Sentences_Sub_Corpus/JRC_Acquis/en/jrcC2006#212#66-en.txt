Case T-185/06: Action brought on 17 July 2006 — L'Air Liquide v Commission Action brought on 17 July 2006 — L'Air Liquide v Commission Parties Applicant: L'Air Liquide SA (Paris, France) (represented by: R.
Saint Esteben and M.
Pittie, lawyers) Defendant: Commission of the European Communities Form of order sought by the applicant The applicant claims that the Court should: - declare the action admissible; - annul Article 1(i) of Commission Decision C (2006) 1766 final of 3 May 2006 relating to a proceeding pursuant to Article 81 EC and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement (Case COMP/F/38.620 — Hydrogen peroxide and perborate) in so far as it decided that L'Air Liquide infringed Article 81 EC and Article 53 EEA between 12 May 1995 and 31 December 1997; - consequently, annul Articles 2(f) and 4 of Commission Decision C (2006) 1766 final of 3 May 2006, as regards L'Air Liquide; - order the Commission to pay all the costs incurred by the applicant in connection with this action.
By its first plea in law, the applicant claims that the Commission made a manifest error of assessment in deciding that the matters which it put forward in order to presume L'Air Liquide jointly and severally liable because of the conduct of its subsidiary were sufficient having regard to the criteria established by the case-law and that the Commission therefore misapplied the rules governing the attribution to a parent company of the conduct of its subsidiary and thus infringed Article 81 EC.
