The basic Regulation does not foresee a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. | LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | Summary of the proposed action On 25 June 2005, the Commission, by a way of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union, initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of chamois leather originating in the PRC.
PROVISIONAL MEASURES (1) On 16 March 2006, the Commission, by Regulation (EC) No 439/2006[2] (‘the provisional Regulation’), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of chamois leather originating in the People’s Republic of China (‘the PRC’).
Export price (14) In the absence of any comments in this respect, recital (25) of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. 3.
Consequently, a further adjustment was made in respect of patchwork chamois leather for the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, by increasing the adjustment for differences in physical characteristics set out in recital (26) of the provisional Regulation. 4.
Dumping margin (17) In the light of the above, the dumping margin finally determined, expressed as a percentage of the CIF Community frontier price, duty unpaid, is 69,8%.
Community production (18) In the absence of any comments in this respect, recital (28) of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. 2.
Subsequently, the Community consumption figures were accordingly amended as follows: Apparent Community consumption | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Square feet (in thousands) | 20 462 | 21 334 | 22 109 | 21 312 | 21 886 | Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 104 | 108 | 104 | 107 | (21) This shows that demand for the product concerned in the Community increased by 7% over the period considered which is slightly more than set out in recital (31) of the provisional Regulation.
On this basis, and in the absence of any other comments concerning Community consumption, the methodology explained in recital (31) of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. 4.
Volume of the imports from the country concerned and market share (22) Given the slightly revised figures for Community consumption, the market share of the imports from the PRC is accordingly modified over the period considered as follows: 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Market share | 10,4% | 7,6% | 22,8% | 29,4% | 30,2% | (23) During the period considered, imports from the PRC increased their share of the Community market from 10,4% in 2001 to 30,2% in the IP.
Therefore, the trend set out in recital 33 of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. (24) Further to the acceptance of the claim made by a Chinese trading company as set out in recital (16) above, and the relevant adjustment made for the purpose of the dumping calculations, an alike adjustment was made to the import prices of the product concerned due to the lower quality of chamois leather exported to the Community from the PRC in the form of patchwork for the purpose of calculating the level of price undercutting.
Economic situation of the Community industry (26) Given the revised figures for Community consumption, the market share of the Community industry is accordingly modified over the period considered as follows: 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Market share | 39,9% | 38,3% | 33,8% | 30,1% | 30,8% | (27) The significant decrease of the Community industry’s sales in volume over the period considered is fully reflected in their market share which decreased continuously from 39,9% in 2001 to 30,8% in the IP.
Therefore, the trend set out in recital 39 of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. (28) In the absence of any other comments in this respect, recitals (37) and (38) and (40) to (54) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 5.
For the purpose of clarity, transparency and completeness of the analysis and in view of the revision of the statistical data mentioned in recital (19), a more detailed table with revised imports from third countries is presented below: Imports from other third countries | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Turkey (thousand square feet) | 353 | 380 | 237 | 893 | 1 677 | Average prices (EUR/square feet) | 1,01 | 0,73 | 0,33 | 0,81 | 0,52 | Romania (thousand square feet) | 300 | 137 | 280 | 330 | 303 | Average prices (EUR/square feet) | 0,99 | 0,68 | 0,45 | 0,61 | 0,64 | Pakistan (thousand square feet) | 50 | 330 | 167 | 157 | 210 | Average prices (EUR/square feet) | 1,00 | 0,37 | 0,90 | 1,20 | 0,54 | Mexico(thousand square feet) | 590 | 1 017 | 853 | 293 | 170 | Average prices (EUR/square feet) | 1,54 | 1,16 | 1,06 | 1,43 | 1,13 | Other countries excluding those mentioned above (thousand square feet) | 1 029 | 1 125 | 939 | 881 | 1 138 | Average prices (EUR/square feet) | 1,29 | 0,84 | 0,88 | 0,57 | 0,49 | (35) This table shows that solely imports from Turkey increased substantially, i.e.
The overall market share of imports from these countries, decreased from 9,6% in 2001 to 8,3% in the IP.
