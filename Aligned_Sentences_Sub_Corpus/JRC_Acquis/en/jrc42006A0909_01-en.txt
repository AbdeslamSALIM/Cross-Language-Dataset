A new decision on the basis of Article 187 of the Treaty should be adopted before that date.
When reporting expenditure within EDF to Member States and OECD Development Assistance Committee, the Commission should distinguish between ODA and non-ODA activities. (14) On 22 December 2005, the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission adopted a Joint Statement on a European Union Development Policy: The European Consensus [5]. (15) The EDF should continue to prioritise support to the least-developed and other low-income countries. (16) On 11 April 2006, the Council approved the principle to fund the African Peace Facility from the intra-ACP funds for an amount of up to EUR 300 million covering the initial period 2008 to 2010.
Those funds possibly committed after 31 December 2007 until the entry into force of the present agreement, as referred to above, will exclusively be used to ensure the working ability of the EU administration and to cover the ongoing costs to sustain running projects until the 10th EDF comes into force. 4.
The total amount of resources of the 10th EDF shall cover the period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2013.
The funds of the 10th EDF shall no longer be committed beyond 31 December 2013 unless the Council decides otherwise unanimously, on a proposal from the Commission. 6.
Should a new State accede to the EU, the allocation of contributions referred to in paragraph 2(a) shall be amended by a decision of the Council acting unanimously, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. 8.
The Implementation and Financial Regulation referred to in Article 10, shall include the necessary provisions for co-financing by the EDF, as well as for co-financing activities implemented by Member States.
The Council shall, in accordance with paragraph 7 of the Financial Protocol of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, together with the ACP States, conduct a performance review, assessing the degree of realisation of commitments and disbursements, and the results and impact of the aid provided.
Article 2 Resources allocated for the ACP States The amount of EUR 21966 million referred to in Article 1(2)(a)(i) shall be allocated between the instruments of cooperation as follows: (a) EUR 17766 million to finance national and regional indicative programmes.
Article 3 Resources allocated for the OCTs 1.
Where an OCT becomes independent and accedes to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, the amount indicated in paragraph 1 shall be reduced and those indicated in Article 2(a)(i) correspondingly increased by a decision of the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission.
Article 4 Loans from the EIB’s own resources 1.
To the amount allocated to the investment facility under the 9th EDF referred to in Article 1(2)(b) and the amount referred to in Article 2(d) shall be added an indicative amount of up to EUR 2030 million in the form of loans granted by the EIB from its own resources.
These resources shall be allocated for an amount of up to EUR 2000 million for the purposes set out in Annex II to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and for an amount of up to EUR 30 million for the purposes set out in the Association Decision, in accordance with the conditions specified in its statutes and the relevant provisions of the terms and conditions for investment financing as laid down in Annex II to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and the Association Decision. 2.
The Member States shall undertake to act as guarantor for the EIB, waiving any right to object and in proportion to their contributions to its capital, in respect of all financial commitments arising for borrowers under contracts concluded by the EIB for loans from its own resources pursuant to Article 1 of Annex II to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and the corresponding provisions of the Association Decision. 3.
The guarantee referred to in paragraph 2 shall be restricted to 75 % of the total amount of credits opened by the EIB under all the loan contracts, but shall cover all risks. 4.
Article 5 Operations managed by the EIB 1.
Any commission due to the EIB for managing the loans and operations referred to in paragraph 1 shall be deducted in advance from the sums to be credited to the Member States. 3.
Proceeds and income received by the EIB from operations under the Investment Facility under the 9th and 10th EDF shall be used for further operations under that Facility, in accordance with Article 3 of Annex II to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and after deduction of exceptional expenses and liabilities arising in connection with the Investment Facility. 4.
Article 6 Resources reserved for support expenditure linked to the EDF 1.
