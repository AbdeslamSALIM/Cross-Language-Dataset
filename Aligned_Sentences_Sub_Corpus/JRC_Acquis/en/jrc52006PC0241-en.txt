Proposal for a Council Regulation laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 /* COM/2006/0241 final - CNS 2006/0083 */ EN Brussels, 24.5.2006 COM(2006) 241 final 2006/0083 (CNS) Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
A franchise of the first € 5 000 of direct payment would also apply to such additional reduction as in the case of compulsory modulation, involving an additional amount of aid to be returned to the farmers, within ceilings per Member State applying voluntary modulation to be fixed by the Commission.
Member States would communicate to the Commission the rate of voluntary modulation they wish to apply (up to a maximum of 20%) for the period 2007–2012 (calendar years for direct payments). 7.
Member States applying voluntary modulation would receive the corresponding amounts as a second source of Community funding for their rural development programmes, to which all rural development rules would apply with possible exception of co-financing [Article 70(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005] as well as the pre-financing arrangements for EARDF [Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005].
However, Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 (minimum spending rates per axis) should also apply to the amounts available from voluntary modulation for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the basic rules governing the commonly agreed policy.
Without prejudice to Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, Member States may apply a reduction, hereinafter referred to as “voluntary modulation”, to all the amounts of direct payments within the meaning of Article 2(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 to be granted in their territory in a given calendar year, during the period 2007–2012. 2.
Reductions under voluntary modulation shall be made on the same basis of calculation as that applicable to modulation pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
Additional amounts granted to farmers under Article 12 of that Regulation shall not be subject to those reductions.
In case of application of reductions under voluntary modulation, farmers receiving direct payments under Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall be granted an additional amount of aid which shall be equal to the amount resulting from the application of the percentage of reduction to the first EUR 5 000 or less of direct payments.
That additional amount shall not be subject to the reductions under voluntary modulation nor to modulation pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
Article 2 Within two months of the entry into force of this Regulation Member States shall decide on and communicate to the Commission the annual rates of voluntary modulation that will apply for the period 2007–2012.
Member States may decide not to apply the ceilings referred to in Article 70(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 to the amounts added to the annual breakdown by Member State pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article.
Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 shall not apply to the amounts added to the annual breakdown by Member State pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article.
Article 4 Detailed rules for the application of this Chapter shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 90(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, which shall cover in particular provisions for the integration of voluntary modulation in the rural development programming, or, as appropriate, in Article 41(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, which shall cover in particular provisions for the financial management of voluntary modulation.
Chapter II Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and final provision Article 5 Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 is amended as follows: (1) In Article 12, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following: “2.
