The Commission presents herewith this ad hoc amending letter (AL No 3/2007) to the preliminary draft budget 2007, containing a careful, line by line update on the estimated needs for agricultural expenditure.
The euro-dollar rate used, in accordance with Council Regulation No 1290/2005 on the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, is based on the average rate observed between 1 July and 30 September 2006.
The needs for agricultural expenditure amount to EUR 42 832 million, a reduction of EUR 852 million compared to the PDB.
Overall needs for Heading 2 are estimated at EUR 56 366 million, leaving a margin of EUR 1 985 million in commitment appropriations below the corresponding ceiling of the Financial Framework. 2.
Summary table PDB 2007 | AL 3/2007 | Difference | EUR million | (a) | (b) | (c)=(b)-(a) | CA | PA | CA | PA | CA | PA | Total Appropriations Heading 2 | 57.218 | 55.683 | 56.366 | 54.832 | -852 | -852 | Financial Framework | 58.351 | 58.351 | margin | 1.133 | 1.985 | 852 | 852 | Of which | Agricultural expenditure (market related expenditure and direct payments) | 43.684 | 43.408 | 42.832 | 42.556 | -852 | -852 | International fisheries agreements | 194 | 194 | 194 | 194 | 0 | 0 | of which: -"Operational line" | 59 | 59 | 145 | 145 | 86 | 86 | - "Reserve" | 135 | 135 | 49 | 49 | -86 | -86 | 2.2.
The total appropriations for Agricultural Expenditure are lower than estimated in the PDB 2007 (- EUR 852 million).
This saving mainly results from a downward revision of needs for Direct Aids (chapter 05 03 - EUR 782 million).
The needs for Interventions on Agricultural Markets (chapter 05 02) decrease by EUR 71 million compared with the PDB, and include some important changes within the chapter (increases and reductions depending on the sector).
Significant additional revenue is expected to come from clearance procedures (+ EUR 238 million) and from the milk superlevy (+ EUR 43 million). 2.2.2.
Euro-dollar exchange rate In accordance with Article 21 of Council Regulation No 1290/2005 on the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, the euro-dollar rate to be used for the letter of amendment is the average rate over the most recent three-month period.
In the case of this letter of amendment, this means the period between 1 July and 30 September 2006.
The average exchange rate recorded is EUR 1 = USD 1,27 which is higher than the rate used for the preliminary draft budget (EUR 1 = USD 1,20).
Detailed comments 05 02 Interventions in agricultural markets appropriations in preliminary draft budget: EUR 5 698 million appropriations after letter of amendment: EUR 5 628 million Favourable prospects for some agricultural markets explain the decrease in appropriations for cereals (- EUR 178 million), refunds on non-Annex I products (- EUR 45 million) and beef (-EUR 35 million).
A reduction in needs is also entered for fruits and vegetables (-EUR 83 million) and milk products (- EUR 31 million).
The wine sector is absorbing EUR 76 million more appropriations than initially foreseen because of additional needs for market measures, in particular distillation.
Additional appropriations for sugar (+ EUR 88 million) are mainly due to the export refund payments from the previous year taking longer to pay than anticipated and lower sales from intervention stocks.
Exceptional market support measures decided after the occurrence of avian influenza are the main reason for the increased needs for the poultry and egg sector (+ EUR 53 million).
The comments below explain the main differences between the appropriations of the PDB and those of the AL. 05 02 01 – Cereals (appropriations – EUR 178 million) appropriations in preliminary draft budget: EUR 694 million appropriations after letter of amendment: EUR 516 million The decrease of nearly 25% in the budgetary needs for cereals is brought about by a combination of positive market developments which have occurred since the PDB 2007 was drawn up.
All these elements have a sizeable effect on the budgetary needs for the sector leading to downward adjustments for export refunds for cereals (- EUR 62 million) and intervention storage of cereals (-EUR 155 million).
However, due to a strengthening of the euro, accounting for an additional EUR 68 million in the cereals sector, it is not possible to realise the full benefit of the positive market developments.
PDB (million t) | AL (million t) | Opening Stocks Purchases Sales Closing Stocks Average Stocks | 16.6 8.1 5.5 19.2 18.9 | 11.3 8.4 8.0 11.7 12.0 | Based on the most recent execution data for budget 2006, production refunds for starch are expected to increase by EUR 39 million compared to the PDB 2007. 05 02 05 – Sugar (appropriations + EUR 88 million) appropriations in preliminary draft budget: EUR 235 million appropriations after letter of amendment: EUR 323 million The net increase in appropriations for the sugar sector is justified by a number of market-related conditions.
However, as world prices show a positive trend, estimations in the PDB of 342 dollar/tonne are now increased to 360 dollar/tonne, generating some savings.
With regard to storage of sugar (+ EUR 50 million), increased imbalances in the sugar market are forecasted, compared to the PDB.
it is foreseen that 100 000 additional tonnes will be in storage at the beginning of the period (1 October 2006) and 130 000 tonnes less will be sold during the period (1 October 2006 – 30 September 2007). 05 02 08 – Fruit and vegetables (appropriations - EUR 83 million) appropriations in preliminary draft budget: EUR 1 407 million appropriations after letter of amendment: EUR 1 324 million Forecast expenditure for fruit and vegetables is reduced in comparison with the PDB.
The appropriations for processed tomatoes show a reduction in needs of EUR 76 million due to a decrease of the quantities foreseen for processing (from 11,5 million tonnes in the PDB to 9 million tonnes in the AL).
The appropriations for processed citrus fruits show a slight decrease (EUR 7 million), in particular, because of a further reduction in the aid (overshoot of the ceiling for oranges) and an adaptation in the quantities of fruit to be processed. 05 02 09 – Products of the wine-growing sector (appropriations + EUR 76 million) appropriations in preliminary draft budget: EUR 1 411 million appropriations after letter of amendment: EUR 1 487 million The EU wine sector is still characterised by a difficult market situation with large stocks.
Compared to the PDB 2007, the needs assessment is higher for all market measures (Export refunds: + EUR 10 million; Storage of wine and must: + EUR 20 million; Distillation: + EUR 63 million; Storage of alcohol: + EUR 14 million; Aid for the use of must: + EUR 28 million), while structural measures related to the production potential are expected to be less costly than initially expected (Permanent abandonment: - EUR 14 million; Restructuring and conversion: - EUR 45 million). 05 02 11 04 – POSEI (excluding direct aids and FISH 11 02 03) (appropriations + EUR 95 million) appropriations in preliminary draft budget: EUR 117 million appropriations after letter of amendment: EUR 212 million The increase in this budget line (+ EUR 95 million) needs to be seen in relation to the reduction for budget line 05 03 02 50 (- EUR 95 million).
Consequently, a shift of market-related expenditure has been made to budget line 05 02 11 04. 05 02 12 – Milk and milk products (appropriations – EUR 31 million) appropriations in preliminary draft budget: EUR 618 million appropriations after letter of amendment: EUR 587 million Updated market forecasts for the dairy sector still confirm the analysis of the PDB 2007 showing good market prospects for most milk products, despite a slightly less favourable development for butterfat.
Compared to the PDB 2007, appropriations asked for internal disposal measures of skimmed milk could therefore be reduced by – EUR 40 million.
On the other hand, expenditure for measures related to butterfat are expected to be somewhat higher, explaining the small increases for export refunds (+ EUR 6 million) and intervention storage of butter and cream (+ EUR 3 million).
Based on updated market forecasts, the Commission proposes to reduce appropriations for export refunds of meat (- EUR 23 million) and live animals (-EUR 9 million).
A small additional saving (- EUR 3 million) compared to the PDB has been identified for the budget item financing exceptional support measures (Over Thirty Months Scheme and Older Cattle Disposal Scheme measures related to BSE) on the basis of the most recent uptake figures. 05 02 15 07 – Exceptional market-support measures for the poultrymeat and eggs sector (appropriations + EUR 60 million) appropriations in preliminary draft budget: p.m.
For the budget 2007, the financial needs are estimated at EUR 60 million, which was not foreseen in the PDB. 05 03 Direct Aids appropriations in preliminary draft budget: EUR 37 661 million appropriations after letter of amendment: EUR 36 879 million The appropriations for this chapter are revised downwards by EUR 782 million.
Also, the budgetary ceilings for the SPS decreased by EUR 29 million since the PDB was drawn up[4].
The difference (-EUR 7 million) stems from a correction made regarding the dairy restructuring reserve. 05 03 02 – Other direct aids (appropriations – EUR 269 million) appropriations in preliminary draft budget: EUR 6 484 million appropriations after letter of amendment: EUR 6 215 million Following the latest communications received from Member States, the appropriations for energy crops (05 03 02 27) have been revised upwards (+ EUR 16 million).
The appropriations for banana compensatory aid (05 03 02 30) show a significant saving of EUR 195 million.
No needs are foreseen for the 2007 campaign because of the reform of the sector.
Appropriations for budget line 05 03 02 39 are set at EUR 20 million (PDB=p.m.).
It concerns the Additional amount for sugar foreseen in Chapter 10 f of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 as modified by Council Regulation (EC) No 319/2006[7] that establishes a transitional (five years) coupled aid for beet growers who continue beet production in Member States that reduce their sugar quota by more than 50%.
Budget item 40 02 41 02 - Differentiated appropriations (compulsory expenditure): in chapter 40 02 - Reserves for financial interventions: EUR 48 778 500 in commitment and payment appropriations for International fisheries agreements (- EUR 86 000 000 compared to EUR 134 778 500 in the PDB 2007).

[2] OJ C 139, 14.6.2006, p.1 [3] Article 180 of the Financial Regulation lays down that, as from 1.1.2007, negative agricultural expenditure will be replaced by revenue assigned to the EAGF.
Therefore, expenditure financed by means of assigned revenue cannot be shown in the budget. [4] Annex IV of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1156/2006, OJ L 208, 29.7.2006, p.3.

[8] AL 1/2007 did not have any effect on expenditure, only on revenue. [9] The EGF is not included in the calculation of the margin under Heading 1a. [10] The 2007 margin for heading 4 does not take into account the appropriations related to the Emergency Aid Reserve (EUR 234,5 million).
