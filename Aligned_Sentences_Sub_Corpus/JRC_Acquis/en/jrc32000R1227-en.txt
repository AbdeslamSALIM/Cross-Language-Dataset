Commission Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 of 31 May 2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine, as regards production potential Commission Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 of 31 May 2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine, as regards production potential THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), and in particular Articles 7(2), 10, 15, 23 and 80 thereof, Whereas: (1) Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, which replaced Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1677/1999(3), with effect from 1 August 2000, contains, in Title II, provisions on production potential.
It is now appropriate to fill out the framework thereby laid down, by enacting implementing rules and by repealing the previous regulations on this subject, namely Commission Regulations (EEC) No 2314/72(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2462/93(5), (EEC) No 940/81(6), (EEC) No 3800/81(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2548/1999(8), (EEC) 2729/88(9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) 2182/97(10), (EEC) No 2741/89 (11), and (EEC) No 3302/90(12). (2) Member States are permitted, pursuant to Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, to impose more restrictive national rules in respect of the new planting or replanting of vines or grafting-on, than those set out in Title II of that Regulation, which includes the imposition of such rules in respect of the grant, transfer and use of planting rights. (3) Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for Member States to be able to grant permission in the cases defined in points (a) to (d) of that provision to produce wine which is to be marketed, subject to controls.
Wine-sector products made from grapes coming from such areas before grubbing-up takes place should not be allowed to disturb the market balance and should therefore be distilled. (5) Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for the grant of new planting rights in the case of measures for land consolidation or measures concerning compulsory purchase in the public interest.
The new planting rights should not exceed those necessary to plant an area equivalent to 105 % of that lost to producers as a result of those measures, so as to avoid undermining the prohibition on planting contained in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. (6) Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 also provides for the grant of new planting rights in the case of wine-growing experiments.
The areas planted in pursuance of such grants of new planting rights should only be used for the specified purposes, and wine-sector products made from grapes coming from such areas both during and after the experimental period should not be allowed to disturb the market balance.
Existing wine-growing experiments should be allowed to continue, subject to the existing rules. (7) Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 also provides for the grant of new planting rights in the case of graft nurseries.
The areas planted in pursuance of such grants of new planting rights should only be used for the specified purposes, and wine-sector products made from grapes coming from such areas both during and after the period of production of graft nurseries should not be allowed to disturb the market balance.
Such recognition should be based on objective criteria and data. (10) To ensure the equivalency and accuracy of such objective data across the Community, it should compulsorily include the inventory of production potential provided for in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 or equivalent information. (11) In order to prevent disturbance of the market balance, no replanting rights should be granted in respect of areas which have been compulsorily grubbed up owing to a breach of the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
During the period of coexistence of newly planted area and area to be grubbed up, in order to avoid disturbance of market balance, only one such area should be permitted to produce wine to be marketed. (13) Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for the creation of national and/or regional reserves in order to improve the management of production potential.
In these situations, Member States are permitted under Article 5(7) to apply a reduction coefficient in respect of transfers of rights. (14) Article 5(8) of Regulations (EC) No 1493/1999 provides that Member States are not to implement the reserve system if they can show that an effective system for managing planting rights exists throughout its territory.
Member States wishing to use the option under Article 5(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 should be able to prove that such a system exists and to demonstrate the need for any derogations from the provisions of Chapter I of Title II of that Regulation. (15) The Commission may decide to make allocations from the Community reserve of planting rights referred to in Article 6(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the basis of requests from Member States. (16) Chapter II of Title II of Regulations (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for the granting of a premium in return for the permanent abandonment of vine growing on a particular area.
Nevertheless, common detailed rules concerning applications, appropriate maximum levels of the premium and appropriate dates as referred to in Article 10 of that Regulations should be laid down. (17) In the interests of verification, payment of the premium should normally be made after grubbing-up.
Other information necessary for the verification and auditing of the implementation of that Title should be retained by Member States for inspection for an appropriate period. (29) In this context, it is necessary to lay down the details of the information to be set out in the inventory referred to in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
Member States who do not wish to benefit by seeking the regularisation of unlawfully planted areas, the increase in planting rights, or support for restructuring and conversion are not obliged to compile the inventory. (30) Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides that the classification of vine varieties should be delegated to Member States.
The classification system as such should not lead to an any increase in production potential. (31) In principle, only those varieties which may be placed on the market in at least one Member State under Council Directive 68/193/EEC of 9 April 1968 on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine(14), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, should be included in the classification.
However, in the interests of the preservation of genetic heritage, other varieties planted before the entry into force of that Directive should also be eligible for classification. (32) Where a producer is obliged to distil products due to a breach of Community rules, no Community support should be granted for the distillation or distillate. (33) The payments made under Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 should be made in full to the beneficiaries. (34) By way of a transitional measure, planting rights which were governed by Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and which were valid until a date later than 31 July 2000 should remain valid until such later date in order to ensure that they are not lost in the transition to the system governed by Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
CHAPTER II Planting of vines Article 2 1.
However, this period shall not extend beyond 31 March 2002.
A Member State may only grant a derogation pursuant to that provision where the replanting rights concerned are valid at the date of the application for the derogation. 6.
Member States shall communicate to the Commission in respect of each wine year the total area for which a derogation has been applied for, the total area for which a derogation has been granted and the total area for which a derogation has been refused.
In either case, these products may not be used in the preparation of alcohol having an actual alcoholic strength of 80 % vol or less. 9.
Where Member States grant new planting rights in respect of areas intended for new planting carried out under measures for land consolidation or measures concerning compulsory purchases in the public interest adopted under national legislation, they shall ensure that these rights are not granted for an area greater in terms of pure crop than 105 % of the area under vines which was the subject of the measures for land consolidation or measures concerning compulsory purchases in the public interest.
Member States shall record each case where new planting rights are granted for these purposes. 2.
The rules in the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 shall apply to such areas after the end of the experimental period. 4.
Member States shall record each case where they grant new planting rights in respect of areas whose wine or vine products are intended solely for the consumption of the vine grower's family. 7.
By way of derogation from paragraph 6, in order to avoid an excessive administrative burden being imposed, a Member State may instead provide that areas whose wine or vine products are intended solely for consumption by the vine grower's family shall not be subject to the grubbing-up requirement in Article 2(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
These products may not be used in the preparation of alcohol having an actual alcoholic strength of 80 % vol or less.
A Member State shall grant no more rights to a producer than are necessary to permit the entire area concerned to be planted with vines, taking into account any rights already in his possession.
Member States shall keep a record of all transfers of replanting rights between holdings. 9.
Member States shall keep a record of all cases where planting rights are granted from reserves, of all cases where planting rights are transferred between reserves and all cases where planting rights are allocated to reserves.
The Commission may make such allocations in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 75 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
CHAPTER III Abandonment premiums Article 7 Member States shall communicate to the Commission any areas which they have designated in which the premium for the permanent abandonment of vine-growing may be granted and any conditions to which that designation is subject.
However, Member States may provide for the premium to be advanced to the producer before the obligation to grub up has been met, provided that the producer lodges a security of an amount equal to 120 % of the premium.
For the purposes of Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85, the obligation shall be the obligation to grub up the area concerned.
In this case, grubbing-up shall take place no later than the end of the wine year following that during which the premium was paid. 3.
Member States may provide that, for producers who are members of a %quot%producer organisation%quot% as defined in Article 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the premium shall be reduced by up to 15 %.
In such cases, the sums corresponding to this reduction shall be paid to the producer organisation in question. 4.
A premium may only be granted in respect of areas no smaller than 10 ares but no larger than 25 ares where the area concerned is the entire wine-growing area of the holding.
In respect of areas larger than 25 ares, the maximum level of the premium per hectare shall not exceed: (a) 1450 EUR where the average yield per hectare is no greater than 20 hectolitres; (b) 3400 EUR where the average yield per hectare is greater than 20 hectolitres but no greater than 30 hectolitres; (c) 4200 EUR where the average yield per hectare is greater than 30 hectolitres but no greater than 40 hectolitres; (d) 4600 EUR where the average yield per hectare is greater than 40 hectolitres but no greater than 50 hectolitres; (e) 6300 EUR where the average yield per hectare is greater than 50 hectolitres but no greater than 90 hectolitres; (f) 8600 EUR where the average yield per hectare is greater than 90 hectolitres but no greater than 130 hectolitres; (g) 11100 EUR where the average yield per hectare is greater than 130 hectolitres but no greater than 160 hectolitres: (h) 12300 EUR where the average yield per hectare is greater than 160 hectolitres. 6.
By way of derogation from paragraph 4, Member States may decide to grant the premium in respect of areas no smaller than 10 ares but no larger than 25 ares where the area concerned is not the entire wine-growing area of the holding.
Article 9 The period referred to in points (a), (c) and (d) of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 shall each be 10 wine years following the end of the wine year in question.
Member States shall record details of each application and its outcome. 2.
Member States shall communicate to the Commission in respect of each wine year: (a) the total area which has been grubbed up in return for a premium under Chapter II of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999; and (b) estimates for the following wine year.
Article 11 Where Member States grant national aid designed to achieve objectives similar to those sought by Chapter II of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, they shall: (a) record details of each application and its outcome; (b) communicate to the Commission in respect of each wine year the total area which has been grubbed up solely in return for a national aid and the total amount of aid paid.
This communication shall be made no later than four months after the end of the wine year in question; and (c) ensure that the communication made under Article 10(2) of this Regulation specifies what proportion of the area concerned was grubbed up in return for national aid, in addition to a premium under Chapter II of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, and the total amount of national aid paid in this context.
Article 13 Member States shall lay down: (a) a minimum size of parcel which may be the subject of support for restructuring and conversion, and a minimum size of parcel resulting from restructuring and conversion; (b) definitions of the measures to be contained in plans, time limits for their execution, which shall not exceed five years, a requirement that all plans shall state, for each financial year, the measures to be executed in that financial year, and the area concerned by each measure, and procedures for monitoring such execution; (c) rules limiting the use, in implementing a plan, of replanting rights which arise from grubbing-up as set out in the plan where so doing would lead to a possible increase in the yield of the area covered by it.
Article 14 Where a Member State chooses to draw up restructuring and conversion plans itself, then it shall lay down: (a) which bodies or individuals may submit draft plans; (b) the content of draft plans, which shall include detailed descriptions of the proposed measures and proposed deadlines for their execution; (c) a minimum area to be covered by restructuring and conversion plans, and any derogations from this requirement which shall be duly justified and based on objective criteria; and (d) the procedure for the presentation and approval of plans, which shall in particular provide for deadlines for the submission of draft plans and objective criteria for their prioritisation.
By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States may provide for support to be advanced to the producer before a specific measure has been executed provided that: (a) execution of the specific measure has started; (b) the producer has lodged a security of an amount equal to 120 % of the support.
For the purposes of Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85, the obligation shall be to execute the measure concerned within two years of the advance being made; and (c) where the producer concerned has previously received an advance of support in respect of another measure, that other measure has been executed. 3.
However, should more than 80 % of those measures have been executed within the time limits, then the repayment shall be equal to twice the additional support which would have been granted for the completion of all the measures in the plan.
The Member States shall forward to the Commission, not later than 30 June each year in respect of the restructuring and conversion system: (a) a statement of expenditure actually incurred in the current financial year; (b) any requests for the subsequent financing of expenditure in the current financial year in excess of the financial allocations made pursuant to Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, and the total area concerned in each case; and (c) amended expenditure forecasts, and the total areas concerned, for subsequent financial years until the end of the foreseen period of implementation of the restructuring and conversion plans, in accordance with the allocation for each Member State. 2.
For each Member State, expenditure actually incurred and declared for any given financial year shall be financed up to the limit of the amounts notified to the Commission under point (a) of Article 16(1), provided that those amounts do not exceed in total the financial amount allocated to the Member State pursuant to Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. 2.
Requests made by Member States in accordance with point (b) of Article 16 shall be accepted on a pro rata basis, using the amount available after deducting, for all Member States, the total of the amount notified in accordance with point (a) of Article 16 from the total financial amount allocated to the Member States pursuant to Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
The Commission shall notify the Member States as soon as possible after 30 June of the extent to which the requests may be accepted. 3.
Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, where the total area notified in accordance with point (1) of Article 16(1) is less than the number of hectares indicated in the allocation for the financial year made to the Member State pursuant to Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, then expenditure declared for the financial year in question shall be financed only up to a limit which is calculated by reducing the limit referred to in paragraph 1 in proportion to the shortfall in the total area notified. 4.
Where expenditure actually incurred by a Member State in a given financial year is less than 75 % of the amounts referred to in paragraph 1, the expenditure to be recognised for the following financial year, and the corresponding total area, shall be reduced by a third of the difference between this threshold and the actual expenditure incurred during the financial year in question. 5.
References to a given financial year shall refer to payments actually made by Member States between 16 October and the following 15 October.
CHAPTER V Information and general provisions Article 19 1.
Where a Member State chooses to draw up the inventory on a regional basis, and where it creates regional reserves under Chapter I of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, then the regions used for both purposes shall be the same. 3.
The proportion of the total area under a given wine variety shall also be stated where that proportion is significant; (b) in the case of the stock of existing planting rights, be broken down to show: (i) an estimate of the amount, in hectares, of new planting rights allocated to producers but not yet used, (ii) an estimate of the amount, in hectares, of replanting rights held by producers but not yet used, (iii) the amount, in hectares, of newly created planting rights not yet allocated to a reserve or reserve or under Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, and (iv) the amount, in hectares, of planting rights held in the reserve or reserves; and c) in the case of an inventory drawn up on a national basis, be broken down according to an appropriate regional basis. 4.
In relation to the occasion when the inventory is first compiled, it shall contain information relating to the situation on a date to be chosen by a Member State in the preceding wine year.
Only varieties which may be placed on the market in at least one Member State under Directive 68/193/EEC may be included in a Member States classification. 7.
By way of derogation from paragraph 6, a Member State may also include in its classification varieties of wines which were planted prior to the entry into force of Directive 68/193/EEC and which are still in place in its territory. 8.
Where a Member State, in which Chapter I of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 applies, classifies a variety for the production of wine which has not previously been so classified in the administrative unit concerned, whether under Community or national legislation, areas already planted with that variety may not be used to produce wine.
The Member State shall communicate any use of the derogation referred to in paragraph 7 to the Commission by 31 July 2001, stating whether it intends to apply the derogation referred to in paragraph 8. 10.
When, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 and this Regulation, Member States communicate to the Commission the measures adopted, they shall also provide a brief synopsis of such provisions. 2.
CHAPTER VI Transitional and final provisions Article 22 Where a producer is required, under Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 or this Regulation, to distil any product, neither the distillation nor the distillate shall benefit from any aid financed by the Community.
Article 23 Payments under Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 and this Regulation shall be made in full to the beneficiaries.
Planting rights governed by Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 which, under that Regulation, were valid until a date later than 31 July 2000 shall remain valid until such later date. 2.
Article 26 This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
It shall apply from 1 August 2000.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
