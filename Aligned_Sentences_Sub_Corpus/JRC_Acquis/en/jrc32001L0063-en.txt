ANNEX Amendments to Annexes III and IV to Directive 97/68/EC 1.
Annex III is amended as follows: (1) in paragraph 2.2.2, the formula shall be replaced by the following: 0,96 %amp%lt;= fa %amp%lt;= 1,06 (2) in Appendix 2, paragraph 1.2.1, third indent %quot%CO%quot% shall be replaced by %quot%CO2%quot%; (3) in Appendix 2, paragraph 1.9.2.2 is replaced by the following: %quot%1.9.2.2.
The water vapour concentration (in %) of the mixture shall be calculated as follows: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2001227EN.004202.TIF%quot%%gt% and recorded as H.
For diesel exhaust, the maximum exhaust water vapour concentration (in %) expected during testing shall be estimated, under the assumption of a fuel atom H/C ration of 1,8 to 1, from the maximum CO2 concentration in the exhaust gas or from the undiluted CO2 span gas concentration (A, as measured in section 1.9.2.1) as follows: Hm = 0,9 x A and recorded as Hm.
The water quench shall be calculated as follows: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2001227EN.004204.TIF%quot%%gt% and must not be greater than 3 % of full scale.
De: expected diluted NO concentration (ppm) C: diluted NO concentration (ppm) Hm: maximum water vapour concentration (%) H: actual water vapour concentration (%) NB: It is important that the NO span gas contains minimal NO2 concentration for this check, since obsorption of NO2 in water has not been accounted for in the quench calculations.%quot% (4) in Appendix 3, paragraph 1.4.4, the second formula for single filter particulate mass flow background correction is deleted and the first formula is amended as follows; %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2001227EN.004205.TIF%quot%%gt% 2.
