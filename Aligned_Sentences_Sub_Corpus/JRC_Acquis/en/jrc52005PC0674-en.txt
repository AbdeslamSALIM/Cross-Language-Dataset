The investigation showed that Hanita’s exports to the Community of PET film under CN codes ex 3920 6219 or ex 3920 6290 began after the extension of measures, that Hanita’s exports to the Community consisted of PET film products manufactured by them, using film of non-Indian origin, that Hanita is not related to any of the exporters or producers in the exporting country which are subject to the anti-dumping and anti-subsidies measures on the product and that it has not circumvented the anti-dumping or countervailing measures in force.
It is therefore proposed to amend Council Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 and No 1976/2004 in order to exempt Hanita from the extended measures and to cease the registration of imports of PET film consigned from Israel by Hanita, without collection of the anti-dumping duties.
