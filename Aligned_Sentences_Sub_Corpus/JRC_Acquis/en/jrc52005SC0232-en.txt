Recommendation for a Council opinion in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated convergence programme of Lithuania, 2004-2007 /* SEC/2005/0232 final */ Brussels, 16.2.2005 SEC(2005) 232 final Recommendation for a COUNCIL OPINION in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated convergence programme of Lithuania, 2004-2007 (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies[1] stipulates that non-participating Member States, that is, those which have not adopted the single currency, have to submit convergence programmes to the Council and the Commission.
In accordance with Article 9 of this Regulation, the Council has to examine each convergence programme based on assessments prepared by the Commission and the Committee set up by Article 114 of the Treaty (the Economic and Financial Committee).
They committed themselves to submitting their convergence programmes by 15 May 2004 and a first update thereof towards the end of 2004.
The first convergence programme of Lithuania, covering the period 2004-2007, was submitted on 14 May 2004 and assessed by the Council on 5 July 2004.
Lithuania submitted an update of its convergence programme on 14 January 2005.
Lithuania intends to be ready for the introduction of the euro in early 2007. - The key objective of the medium-term fiscal strategy defined in the programme is the approximation to a cyclically balanced general government budget.
The programme foresees the general government deficit to remain at 2.5% of GDP in 2005 but to decline gradually thereafter, to 1.5% in 2007.
A significant programme of public investment is being implemented, which lifts public investment from 3.4% of GDP in 2004 to 5% in 2007, resulting in an average public investment ratio over the programme period of about 4.6% of GDP.
The targets for 2005-2007 are maintained, despite a considerable downward revision of GDP growth. - The risks to the budgetary projections in the programme appear broadly balanced.
Against the background of the strong economic performance and the large current account deficit, the budgetary targets do not appear ambitious, also in view of preventing potential risks of overheating. - The programme projects an initial increase of the debt to GDP ratio in 2004 by 0.8 percentage points, mostly due to the increase of the general government deficit in the same year.
The ratio is expected to decrease throughout the remainder of the programme horizon and reach 20.1% in 2007.
In view of the above assessment it would be appropriate for Lithuania to: i) make further progress towards a close-to-balance budgetary position, particularly in view of its current account deficit and domestic demand pressures, fuelled by strong credit growth, ii) implement strictly the budget for 2005 in order to reduce the risk of breaching the 3% reference value, iii) use better-than-projected or additional revenues and unused expenditure items for deficit reduction.
The macro-economic scenario underlying the programme envisages real GDP growth to decelerate from 6.5% in 2004 to 6.2% on average over the rest of the programme period.
The programme’s projections for inflation also appear realistic, although the projection for 2006 appears on the low side.
The programme foresees the general government deficit to remain at 2.5% of GDP in 2005 and to decline gradually thereafter to 1.5% in 2007.
The primary deficit is expected to improve marginally from 1.5% of GDP in 2004 to 1.4% in 2005, decreasing gradually afterwards to 0.5% in 2007.
Expenditure is foreseen to initially increase from 35.5% of GDP in 2004 to 36.9% in 2005, decreasing gradually to 36% in 2007.
The programme projects the debt ratio to remain at the same level in 2007, after peaking at 20.9% in 2005.
The strategy outlined in the programme is based on a contained budgetary deficit over the medium term and the long-term budgetary impact of the pension reform.
The announced measures are not extended to savings made in items unrelated to EU co-financing. * * * In view of the above assessment, the Council is of the opinion that Lithuania should: i) make further progress towards a close-to-balance budgetary position, particularly in view of its current account deficit and domestic demand pressures, fuelled by strong credit growth, ii) implement strictly the budget for 2005 in order to reduce the risk of breaching the 3% reference value and, iii) use better-than-projected or additional revenues and unused expenditure items for deficit reduction.
