Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the %lsquo%Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on increasing the employment of older workers and delaying the exit from the labour market%rsquo%(COM(2004) 146 final) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the "Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on increasing the employment of older workers and delaying the exit from the labour market" (COM(2004) 146 final) (2005/C 157/22) Procedure On 3 March 2004, the Commission decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 262 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned communication.
At its 413th plenary session held on 15 and 16 December 2004 (meeting of 15 December), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 125 votes in favour, 1 against and 5 abstentions.
Indeed, the Stockholm European Council of 2001 concluded that half of the EU population in the 55-64 age group should be in employment by 2010.
The Communication also responds to the request of the Barcelona European Council to analyse progress in this field annually before every Spring Council. 1.5 The present opinion is the contribution of the European Economic and Social Committee to the debate on the employment rate of older workers, a debate which the Communication under review has contributed to, and which should be brought to an interim conclusion next December. 2.
The Communication 2.1 The Communication states that with the ageing and the expected shrinking of the working age population, older workers must be recognised for what they are: a core component of labour supply and a key factor for the sustainable development of the European Union. 2.2 According to the Communication, it follows that there is an essential need for policies to maintain labour supply and secure employability even in periods of overall sluggish employment growth. 2.3 To achieve this, it suggests that a preventative approach based on mobilising the full potential of people of all ages in a life-cycle perspective should be the main thrust of policy measures. 2.3.1 It therefore proposes that Member States should formulate and implement comprehensive strategies for active ageing, which may include: - financial incentives to discourage early retirement, and to make employment financially more attractive; - access to training strategies and to lifelong learning; - effective active labour market policies; - good working conditions conducive to job retention, particularly in terms of health and safety, and flexible employment solutions. 2.3.2 The Communication also points out that much stronger participation and commitment of the social partners are needed in designing and implementing comprehensive active ageing strategies.
In 2002, in Europe, there was a marked difference between the figures for men (50.1 %) and for women (30.25 %), giving a total of 40.1 %. 3.2.3 The employment rate has declined continuously since the 1970s up till recently, and on a large scale, particularly between 1980 and 1985 [5].
For example, between 1971 and 1999 the figure fell by 47.4 % in France, 45.8 % in the Netherlands, 39 % in Spain, 38.7 % in Germany, 30 % in Ireland, and 29 % in Portugal and the United Kingdom.
At the level of the EU15, the proportion of the total population in this age group will increase from 25 % in 1995 to 34.40 % in 2025.
This increase will occur much more quickly in the Scandinavian countries [8]. 3.5 This development is particularly worrying in the context of the acute demographic ageing which the European Union will experience [9].
Over the same period, the number of older workers in jobs of mediocre quality leaving the labour market is up to four times higher than that of older workers in higher quality jobs, and twice as high as that of young workers in jobs of mediocre quality [20].
At the very least, a review of previous documents on this subject, such as COM(2003) 728 of 26.11.2003 or the report on Employment in Europe 2002, would have been helpful. 4.4 Other proposals and observations - Generally speaking, as in the case of other policy guidelines of the Lisbon strategy, the strategy for Extending the age of exit from the labour market could be more effectively implemented if accompanied by steady growth, which would benefit employment. - The open method of coordination is used for various areas connected with retirement.
It would be worth reviewing implementation of the directive and assessing its effectiveness in the near future. 4.4.2 Flexibility We have discussed the idea of a flexible retirement age as well as the introduction of flexible organisation of working time prior to early retirement (cf. 4.3.2).
Strategy for raising the age of exit from the labour market 5.1 One of the points made by paragraph 32 of the presidency conclusions of the Barcelona European Council in regard to current employment policies is that: - "a progressive increase of about 5 years in the effective average age at which people stop working in the European Union should be sought by 2010". 5.2 Taken as a whole, the analyses and the proposals discussed in the preceding paragraphs, which relate in particular to the decisions of the Stockholm European Council to raise the employment rate in the 55-64 age group to 50 %, can contribute to implementation of the Barcelona guidelines.
After all, each individual worker in the 55-64 age group who postpones his or her exit from the labour market contributes to an increase in the effective average age at which people stop working in the European Union. 5.3 Implementation of the decisions made by the Stockholm European Council is essential for achieving progress as envisaged by the Barcelona guidelines.
