If historical financial information was not drawn up in accordance with such standards it must be presented in the prospectus in the form of restated financial statements. (3) However, Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 contains transitional provisions which, in certain limited cases, exempt third country issuers from the obligation to restate historical financial information which was not drawn up in accordance with either IFRS or accounting standards of a third country equivalent to IFRS.
Under those transitional provisions, the obligation to restate historical financial information does not apply to any prospectus filed before 1 January 2007 by a third country issuer which has either prepared its historical financial information in accordance with internationally accepted standards, or which has prepared its historical financial information in accordance with the national accounting standards of a third country and has securities admitted to trading on a regulated market before that date.
Lastly, before 1 January 2008, and after appropriate consultation with CESR, the Commission should ensure that there is a definition of equivalence which is used for the determination of the equivalence of third country GAAP, on the basis of an equivalence mechanism set up to that end. (13) Accordingly, it is appropriate to amend Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 so that third country issuers are not required to restate historical financial information or (as the case may be) to provide a narrative description of differences in the cases described during a maximum period of two years so that further dialogue can take place.
