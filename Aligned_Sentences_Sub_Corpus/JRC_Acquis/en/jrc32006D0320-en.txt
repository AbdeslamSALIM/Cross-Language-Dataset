2006/320/EC: Commission Decision of 30 June 2004 on the measures notified by Italy in favour of the publishing industry (notified under document number C(2004) 2215) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 30 June 2004 on the measures notified by Italy in favour of the publishing industry (notified under document number C(2004) 2215) (Only the Italian text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/320/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having called on interested parties to submit their comments [1], and having regard to their comments, Whereas: 1.
PROCEDURE (1) By letters No 15808 and No 15809 of 19 December 2002, registered on 31 December 2002, pursuant to Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty, the Italian authorities notified the Commission of the above measures to support the Italian publishing industry. (2) By letter dated 29 October 2003, the Commission notified Italy of its decision to initiate proceedings under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the two notified measures. (3) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2].
DESCRIPTION OF THE AID MEASURES (7) The two aid measures notified by the Italian authorities concern respectively aid in the form of interest rate subsidies on bank loans in favour of companies active in the publishing industry and tax credits in favour of undertakings producing publishing products [3]. 2.1.
The number of expected beneficiaries is between 101 and 500. (12) A 10-year limit for the aid scheme is foreseen [8].
The total budget allocation for the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 is equal to about EUR 26,3 million [9], increased by EUR 50,8 million of previously unspent appropriations.
The aid granted under this scheme can only be cumulated with that introduced by Article 8 of the same law described hereinafter [10]. (13) The benefits foreseen in Articles 5 to 7 of Law 62/2001 will be awarded by a bespoke fund instituted and administered by the Presidency of the Council of Ministers [11].
This measure also contains dispositions for the recovery of unduly granted benefits. (14) Aid granted under this scheme aims at preserving the information pluralism within the meaning of Article 21 of the Italian Constitution. 2.2.
Investments in plant, equipment and patents destined to all phases of the production cycle as part of technical and economic restructuring are also eligible for aid under the reviewed scheme. (18) The aid scheme is limited to investment taking place before 31 December 2004.
The allocated budget for the entire period is about EUR 102 million [17].
The aid granted under this scheme can only be cumulated with that introduced by Articles 4 to 7 of the aforementioned law [18].
The number of expected beneficiaries is between 101 and 500. (20) Aid granted under this scheme aims at promoting culture and preserving the information pluralism within the meaning of Article 21 of the Italian Constitution. 3.
An overview of the relevant comments from these parties is outlined in the following paragraphs. (24) In its letter of 18 December 2003, the Federation of European Publishers (FEP-FEE) considered that the aid measures are not in violation with EU legislation because: (i) publishing, unlike other industrial activities, is extremely language dependent and thus State support to publishing is unlikely to affect cross-border trade in the European Union; (ii) the amount of aid provided is very modest; (iii) the support is addressed to types of investments that are tailored to linguistic areas and the publications benefiting from State aid are only those in the Italian language.
The rationale of State support is to stimulate private investments in order to cope with competition between publishers and other companies in the same competitive arena, which is a national one. (25) In its letter of 19 December 2003, the Association of Portuguese Book Publishers (APEL) considered that the aid measures under review are not in violation with EU legislation because: (i) of the reasons identical to those outlined above by the FEE; and (ii) the eligible investments are not directed to export or to actions in the international environment. (26) In addition, the Commission received the following comments from interested parties in the course of the investigation more than a month after the publication of the opening decision. (27) In their letter of 8 January 2004, the Spanish Federation of Publishers (FGEE) considered that the aid measures under review are not in violation of EU legislation for the identical reasons invoked above by the Association of Portuguese Book Publishers. (28) In their letter of 12 January 2004, the European Newspaper Publishers’ Association (ENPA) considered that the aid measures under review are not in violation with EU legislation because: (i) newspapers’ cross-border trade is negligible and should not cause competition concerns between Member States.
If it did not receive this support, then sharp economic downturns such as the latest one, which has damaged most of Europe's newspaper sector because of the decline in advertising sales, will seriously jeopardise the future of the national industry. (29) In its letter of 7 January 2004, the Federation of Italian Newspapers’ Publishers (FIEG) submitted a detailed argumentation to support its view that the measures under review are not to be considered as violating EU legislation because: (i) the support measures do not constitute State aid; (ii) the support measures do not constitute aid in relation to activities for which there is no cross-border trade or competition between Member States and the EEA; (iii) the measures are compatible with the common market pursuant to Article 87(3)(d) of the EC Treaty. 5.
Further, they note that the only Italian player producing such reports is ANSA, for which the turnover for this type of report accounts for 0,3 % of the company's total turnover; (viii) to conclude on the issue of the limited trade affectation of the measures under review, the Italian authorities indicate that the aggregate share of Italian publishing products diffused in the EU is 0,3 % to 0,5 % of the EU market. (34) Pursuant to the information above, and in line with the principles outlined in the CFI judgment in the SIDE case [25], the Italian authorities maintain that the market for publishing products in the Italian language should be considered as distinct [26]. (35) Moreover, to underscore the fact that in their view both measures should be compatible with the common market pursuant to Article 87(3)(d) of the EC Treaty, the Italian authorities make reference to: (i) Article 151(1) of the EC Treaty, which state that %quot%the Community shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore%quot%; (ii) the Council Resolution of 12 February 2001 [27] and in particular the Council invitation to the Commission %quot%when applying competition rules and rules on the free taking movement of goods, to take account of the specific value of the book as a cultural object and the importance of books in promoting cultural diversity, and of the cross-border dimension of the book market%quot% [28].
Comments to the interested parties’ observations (37) By letter dated 24 February 2004, the Italian authorities submitted their comments to the interested parties’ observations to the opening of the procedure.
Their main comments can be summarised by the following four considerations: (i) the observations received further to the Commission's invitation were submitted by the five parties indicated in Section 4 of the present decision, which represent book and newspaper publishers in the 15 EU Member States as well as Cyprus, the Republic of Croatia, Lithuania, Norway and Slovenia; (ii) the comments received from the interested parties are in line with those of Italy concerning the non-violation of EU competition law; (iii) as outlined by ENPA, the market for periodical papers is essentially a national market and the proportionality of the measure is fulfilled since, given the structure of the market for publishing products, the latter is not able to produce any significant distortion to trade between Member States; (iv) as stated by FGEE, the aid amounts under consideration are limited.
Selectivity (40) Both notified schemes are selective in that they are addressed respectively to undertakings active in the publishing sector and to undertakings producing publishing products.
Hence, the two schemes under review constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty. 6.2.
On the basis of the above, it appears that intra-EU trade in publishing products in the Italian language is limited and the measures could be deemed to be compatible under Article 87(3)(c) or Article 87(3)(d) of the EC Treaty. 6.2.1.
Compatibility ex Article 87(3)(d) of the EC Treaty (51) Concerning the compatibility of the measures pursuant to Article 87(3)(d), the Commission does not concur with the assessment made by the Italian authorities, and is of the opinion that the cultural derogation is not applicable to the aid schemes in point. (52) In fact, although Article 151 of the EC Treaty [35] indeed foresees that the Community should contribute to cultural diversity, under the terms of Article 8 of Law 62/2001 no dispositions have been outlined concerning the appropriation of funds for the explicit promotion of culture but rather the funds are entirely used for the more general support of investment by undertakings producing publishing products in the Italian language.
Concerning the interest subsidy measure, pursuant to the terms [36] of Article 5 of Law 62/2001, only 5 % of the total funds available under the interest subsidy scheme under examination are explicitly set aside %quot%for undertakings involved in projects of specific relevance for the diffusion of readership in Italy or the for the diffusion of publishing products in Italian abroad%quot%.
Article 3 This Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.
However aid granted under Articles 4 to 7 of Law 62/2001 can be cumulated with the tax credit introduced by Article 8 of the same law. [11] Pursuant to Article 5 of Law 62/2001, the fund is called %quot%Fondo per le agevolazioni di credito alle imprese del settore editoriale%quot%. [12] Article 1 of DPR 142/2002 states that undertakings can only present one project at the time under the automatic procedure. [13] The funding must not exceed ITL 1 billion pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 1(a) of Law 62/2001. [14] The maximum aid cannot exceed ITL 30 billion pursuant to Article 7, paragraph 1(a) of Law 62/2001. [15] The procedures and requirements giving access to the benefit are detailed at paragraphs 2 to 6 of Article 7 of Law 62/2001, and in DPR 142/2002. [16] Under this scheme the maximum amount is set as a percentage of the investment value rather than per beneficiary, nonetheless it is capped by the total funds available. [17] The funds budgeted by the State are respectively about EUR 5,7 million in 2001, EUR 11,3 million in 2002 and EUR 28,4 million for each year from 2003 to 2005. [18] See footnote 11. [19] The definition of an undertaking producing publishing products is more restrictive than the one used under Articles 4, 5 and 7 of the law under review.
