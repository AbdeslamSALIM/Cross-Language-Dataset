Council Directive 96/49/EC of 23 July 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 96/49/EC of 23 July 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 75 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2), Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189c of the Treaty (3), (1) Whereas in recent years the transport of dangerous goods by rail has considerably expanded, thus increasing the risks of accidents occurring; whereas measures must therefore be taken to ensure that such transport is carried out under the best possible conditions of safety; (2) Whereas all Member States are Contracting Parties to the Convention concerning international carriage by rail (COTIF), which, in Appendix B thereto, defines uniform rules concerning the contract for international carriage of goods by rail (CIM), Annex 1 to which constitutes the regulations concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by rail (RID); whereas the geographical scope of the Convention extends beyond the Community; (3) Whereas the Convention does not cover the national carriage of dangerous goods by rail; whereas it is therefore important to ensure the uniform application of harmonized safety rules throughout the Community; whereas the most appropriate way of achieving this is to align the laws applied by the Member States on the RID; (4) Whereas, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, these laws must be approximated in order to ensure a high level of safety for national and international transport operations, to guarantee the elimination of distortions of competition by facilitating the free movement of goods and services throughout the Community and to ensure consistency with the other Community provisions; (5) Whereas the provisions of this Directive are without prejudice to the commitment entered into by the Community and its Member States, in accordance with the goals set under Agenda 21, Chapter 19, at the UNCED Conference in June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, to strive for the future harmonization of systems for the classification of dangerous substances; (6) Whereas no specific Community legislation yet governs the safety conditions under which biological agents and genetically modified micro-organisms, regulated under Directives 90/219/EEC (4), 90/220/EEC (5) and 90/676/EEDC (6) should be transported; (7) Whereas the provisions of this Directive are without prejudice to the application of other Community provisions in the field of worker safety and environmental protection; (8) Whereas the Member States must be able to apply specific traffic regulations to the transport on their territory of dangerous goods by rail; (9) Whereas, the Member States should retain the right, with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail, provisionally to implement rules in conformity with the United Nations recommendations on the multimodal transport of dangerous goods, in so far as the RID is not yet harmonized with those regulations, which should facilitate the inter-modal transport of dangerous goods; (10) Whereas each Member State must retain the right to regulate or prohibit, strictly for reasons other than safety, the internal transport of certain dangerous goods by rail; (11) Whereas account should be taken of the more stringent safety measures applied in the Channel Tunnel because of its specific characteristics, in particular its route and length; whereas provision should also be made for Member States to be able to introduce the same kind of measures where similar situations arise; whereas it must be possible for some Member States to apply more stringent standards for material intended for transport because of the ambient temperature in their countries; (12) Whereas, in view of the volume of investment required in this sector, a transitional period should be laid down to enable Member States to retain temporarily certain specific national provisions concerning construction requirements or the use of tanks, receptacles, packaging or an emergency action code; (13) Whereas the introduction of new developments in technology and industry must not be hindered; whereas temporary derogations should be provided for that purpose; (14) Whereas the provisions of the RID authorize the conclusion of agreements derogating therefrom; whereas the large number of agreements concluded bilaterally between Member States impedes the free provision of dangerous-goods transport services; whereas including the necessary provisions in the Annex to this Directive should overcome the need for such derogations; whereas provision should be made for a transitional period during which the Member States may continue to apply existing agreements amongst themselves; (15) Whereas the transport of dangerous goods by rail to or from a third country is authorized, provided it is carried out in accordance with the requirements of the RID; whereas, however, in the case of transport operations from and to the Republics of the former Soviet Union which are not contracting parties to the COTIF, the Member States are entitled to adopt appropriate measures with regard to such operations; whereas they guarantee a level of safety equivalent to that provided for in the RID; (16) Whereas it must be possible to adapt this Directive rapidly to technical progress, notably by adoption of the new provisions laid down within the framework of the RID; whereas, for that purpose, a Committee should be set up and a procedure established for close cooperation between Member States and the Commission within that Committee, HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: CHAPTER I Scope Article 1 1.
CHAPTER II Derogations, restrictions and exemptions Article 4 Each Member State may, for the purposes of national rail transport operations within its territory, retain provisions of its national law on the transport of dangerous goods by rail which are consistent with the United Nations recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods, until such time as the Annex to this Directive is revised to reflect those recommendations.
Provisions adopted by a Member State shall be notified to the Commission, which shall inform the other Member States. (c) A Member State in which the ambient temperature is regularly lower than - 20 Â°C may impose more stringent standards as regards the operating temperature of material intended for use in the national transport of dangerous goods by rail within its territory until provisions on the appropriate reference temperatures for given climatic zones are incorporated in the Annex. 3.
Each Member State may authorize the transport by rail within its territory of dangerous goods classified, packed and labelled in accordance with international requirements for maritime or air transport whenever the transport involves a sea or air voyage.
A Member State may authorize the use of documentation and languages other than those provided for in the Annex for transport operations confined to its territory. 3.
Within its territory a Member State may allow the use of rail wagons constructed before 1 January 1997 which do not conform with the provisions of this Directive, but were constructed according to national provisions in force on 31 December 1996, provided that those wagons are maintained to the required safety levels. 4.
Receptacles and tanks constructed before 1 January 1999 and maintained to the required safety levels may continue to be used under the original conditions. 5.
A Member State may allow the use, in transport within its territory, of packaging constructed but not certified in accordance with the RID before 1 January 1997, provided that such packaging bears the date of its manufacture, is capable of passing the tests laid down in national provisions in force on 31 December 1996 and provided that they are maintained to the relevant safety levels (including testing and inspection where required), according to the following scheme: metal intermediate bulk containers and metal drums exceeding 50 litres in capacity may be used for up to 15 years after the date of their manufacture; other metal packagings and all plastic packagings may be used for up to five years after the date of their manufacture, but not after 31 December 1998. 7.
A Member State may authorize the transport within its territory of certain dangerous goods packed before 1 January 1997 until 31 December 1998, provided that the goods are classified, packed and labelled in accordance with the requirements laid down in national provisions in force before 1 January 1997. 8.
A Member State may retain the provisions of its national legislation which are in force on 31 December 1996 and relate to the display of an emergency action code in place of the hazard identification number, laid down in the Annex, for national rail transport operations conducted within its territory. 9.
Any Member State may, after consulting the Commission, maintain provisions less stringent than those in the Annex for the transport by rail within its territory of small quantities of certain dangerous goods, with the exception of substances having a medium or high level of radioactivity. 10.
A Member State may authorize within its territory ad hoc transport operations involving dangerous goods or transport operations which are prohibited by the Annex or transport operations performed under conditions different from those laid down in the Annex. 11.
With due regard to Community law, this Directive shall not prejudice the right of a Member State, after consultation with the Commission, to authorize regular transport operations on particular designated routes within its territory, of dangerous goods, forming part of a defined industrial process, which are either prohibited by the Annex or are performed under conditions different from those laid down in the Annex where those operations are of a local nature and are tightly controlled under clearly specified conditions. 12.
Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.
Article 11 This Directive shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Article 12 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

The ignition temperature shall be above 180 Â°C.
The ignition temperature shall be above 170 Â°C.
See 2.3.2.3 to 2.3.2.8, 2.3.2.9(a) and 2.3.2.10 below. 2.3.2.3.
The oven shall be such that the required temperature is restored not more than five minutes after insertion of the sample. 2.3.2.6.
The pressure in the desiccator shall be brought below 6,5 kPa (0,065 bar). 2.3.2.7.
Before being dried as prescribed in 2.3.2.6 above, substances conforming to 2.3.2.2 shall undergo preliminary drying in a well-ventilated oven, with its temperature set at 70 Â°C, until the loss of mass per quarter-hour is less than 0,3 % of the original mass. 2.3.2.8.
Observation and appraisal as in (a). 2.3.2.10.
Ignition temperature (see 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.2.2) (a) The ignition temperature is determined by heating 0,2 g of substance enclosed in a glass test tube immersed in a Wood's alloy bath.
The test tube is placed in the bath when the latter has reached 100 Â°C.
The flash-point shall be determined by means of one of the following types of apparatus: (a) Abel (b) Abel-Pensky (c) Tag (d) Pensky-Martens (e) Apparatus in accordance with ISO 3679:1983 or ISO 3680:1983. 2.3.3.1.2.
The test procedure shall be either according to an equilibrium method or according to a non-equilibrium method. 2.3.3.1.4.
The test methods listed in 2.3.3.1.4 and 2.3.3.1.5 shall only be used for flash-point ranges which are specified in the individual methods.
When the flash-point, determined by a non-equilibrium method in accordance with 2.3.3.1.3 is found to be 23 Â± 2 Â°C or 61 Â± 2 Â°C, it shall be confirmed for each temperature range by an equilibrium method in accordance with 2.3.3.1.2 2.3.3.1.8.
Test apparatus Commercial penetrometer conforming to ISO Standard 2137-1985, with a guide rod of 47,5 g Â± 0,05 g; sieve disc of duralumin with conical bores and a mass of 102,5 g Â± 0,05 g (see Figure 1); penetration vessel with an inside diameter of 72 mm to 80 mm for reception of the sample. 2.3.4.2.
The sample in the hermetically closed penetration vessel is heated to 35 Â°C Â± 0,5 Â°C and is placed on the penetrometer table immediately prior to measurement (not more than two minutes).
Appropriate types of fish include: striped brill (Brachydanio rerio), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).
The no observed effect concentration (NOEC) at 96 hours is also determined. 2.3.5.2.
Acute toxicity for daphnia The object is to determine the effective concentration of the substance in water which renders 50 % of the daphnia unable to swim (EC50).
The appropriate test organisms are daphnia magna and daphnia pulex.
The no observed effect concentration (NOEC) at 48 hours is also determined. 2.3.5.3.
The change in biomass and the rate of growth with algae under the same conditions, but without the presence of the test chemical, are compared over 72 hours.
The progress of degradation is followed for 28 days by determining the parameter specified in the test method used.
Several equivalent test methods are available.
A substance is considered to be readily biodegradable if within not more than 28 days the following criteria are satisfied-within 10 days from when degradation first reaches 10 %: Reduction of DOC: 70 % Generation of CO2: 60 % of theoretical CO2 production Depletion of O2: 60 % of theoretical O2 requirement.
The test may be continued beyond 28 days if the above criteria are not satisfied, but the result will represent the inherent biodegradability of the test substance.
The result is expressed as grams of BOD per gram of test substance.
The results are expressed in grams of COD per gram of substance.
The object is to determine the potential for bioaccumulation either by the ratio at equilibrium of the concentration (c) of a substance in a solvent to that in water or by the bioconcentration factor (BCF). 2.3.5.5.2.
The ratio at equilibrium of the concentration (c) of a substance in a solvent to that in water is normally expressed as a log10.
In the case of n-octanol and water, the result is: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004121EN.015302.TIF%quot%%gt% where Pow is the partition coefficient obtained by dividing the concentration of the substance in n-octanol (co) by the concentration of the substance in water (cw).
If log Pow %amp%gt;= 3,0 then the substance has a potential to bioaccumulate. 2.3.5.5.3.
The bioconcentration factor (BCF) is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the test substance in the test fish (cf) to the concentration in the test water (cw) at steady state: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004121EN.015303.TIF%quot%%gt% The principle of the test involves exposing fish to a solution or dispersion at known concentrations of the test substance in water.
In cases of doubt, the BCF value takes precedence over log Pow, as indicated in the flow chart of the Procedure in 2.3.5.7. 2.3.5.6.
Criteria A substance may be regarded as a pollutant to the aquatic environment if it satisfies one of the following criteria: The lowest of the values of the 96-hour LC50 for fish, the 48-hour EC50 for daphnia or the 72-hour IC50 for algae: - is less than or equal to 1 mg/l; - is greater than 1 mg/l but less than or equal to 10 mg/l, and the substance is not biodegradable; - is greater than 1 mg/l but less than or equal to 10 mg/l, and the log Pow is greater than or equal to 3,0 (unless the experimentally determined BCF is less than or equal to 100). 2.3.5.7 Procedure to be followed %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004121EN.015401.TIF%quot%%gt% Part 3 DANGEROUS GOODS LIST, SPECIAL PROVISIONS AND EXEMPTIONS RELATED TO DANGEROUS GOODS PACKED IN LIMITED QUANTITIES CHAPTER 3.1 General 3.1.1.
