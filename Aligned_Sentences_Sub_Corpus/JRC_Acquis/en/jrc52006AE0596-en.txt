At its 426th plenary session, held on 20 and 21 April 2006 (meeting of 20 April), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 31 votes in favour, no votes against and one abstention. 1.
Summary of the Commission document 2.1 The Commission proposes a streamlined Open Method of Coordination (OMC) for social protection and social inclusion, in line with its first plans from 2003.
General comments 3.1 In order to enable the Committee to fulfil its consultative role, the proposal should have been published before 22 December 2005.
The EESC is also currently preparing opinions on other related topics [5]. 3.4 To our regret, only a few of the NRPs submitted in October 2005 included elements of social protection and social inclusion.
However the EESC urges Member States to make full use of the guidelines prepared by the EU Commission [12]. 5.2 Within the social inclusion strand %quot%Eradication of poverty and social exclusion%quot%, the Member States will draw up new National Action Plans on social inclusion during 2006. 5.2.1 The EESC believes that concrete steps have to be taken on the priority actions defined in March 2005 by the Council of Employment and Social Affairs.
The EESC recalls the EU objective that Member States make decisive steps to eradicate poverty by 2010 [13].
