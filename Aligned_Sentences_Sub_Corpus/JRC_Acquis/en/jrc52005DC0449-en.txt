Report from the Commission to the European Parliament on the follow-up to 2003 Discharge Decisions (Summary) - European Parliament Resolutions {SEC(2005)1161} /* COM/2005/0449 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 19.9.2005 COM(2005) 449 final REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT on the follow-up to 2003 Discharge Decisions (Summary) - European Parliament Resolutions{SEC(2005) 1161} TABLE OF CONTENTS PREAMBLE 3 I - Commission responses to the recommendations made by the EP in the general budget discharge resolution 4 a) Horizontal issues 4 b) Sectoral issues: 5 II - EP Discharge on EDF 8 III - EP Discharge on Agencies 9 PREAMBLE Due to the present translation constraints, the Commission's report on the follow-up to European Parliament (EP) Discharges given for the 2003 financial year[1] is being published in all EU official languages in this summarised form.
Both these follow-up reports relate to the resolutions adopted by the European Parliament on 12 April 2005.
Therefore, although this summary report deals with every theme raised by the EP in its 2003 discharge resolutions, owing to the length limits which it had to comply with, it is advisable to look in the full working document for more information on any particular theme.
In the discharge decisions for the general budget, the EDF and the Agencies, the Commission has identified a total of 113 recommendations made by the European Parliament to the Commission.
The Commission considers that for 45 recommendations the required action has already been taken.
For another 52 recommendations the Commission agrees to take the action recommended by Parliament.
After identifying the gaps and proposing plans of action, the Commission will present in October 2005 an initial report proposing a basis for an understanding with Member States.
Improvement of annual activity reports by Directors-General (recommendations 12 &amp; 14) The new guidelines for the Annual Activity Reports for 2004 (SEC(2004) 1562), address Parliament’s concern about the risk in underlying transactions.
The Commission considers that the Annual Synthesis Report contains its position on main management and control issues and includes appropriate actions for issues requiring remedy at Commission level.
Further horizontal recommendations (recommendations 16, 17 &amp; 18) The Commission cannot produce estimates of error rates for all sectors every year.
In addition the Commission is currently examining ways to carry out more direct verification in the sense indicated by the Court in its 2003 Annual Report.
A pilot project is planned for 2005 (recommendation 22).
As to the monitoring of paying agencies, the new Council regulation requires the head of each paying agency to sign a declaration of assurance (recommendations 26 &amp; 28).
With regard to incomplete Article 8 statements, financial corrections have been applied where the further information the Commission asked Member States to provide or the additional audit work it asked them to carry out as a result of incomplete statements still left a risk of irregular expenditure in the final payment claim (recommendation 46).
As regards Interreg III, the Commission has steadily improved the input of regional analysis into programmes via ex ante evaluations and will continue to work in this direction (recommendation 48).
Internal policies The Commission has sponsored a meeting in June (16/17) in Luxembourg with the Presidency and the Court of Auditors to discuss simplification of the 7th Framework Programme and the issues to be addressed in its rules for participation (recommendation 51).
The proposal for the 7th Framework Programme adopted by the Commission on 6 April 2005 clearly indicates a simplification in the intervention mechanisms.
The Commission will provide a report on the control structures in place in Delegations (recommendations 62-63) before the next discharge exercise.
In view of this, the Commission does not see the need for an action plan as recommended by Parliament (recommendation 64).
The European Parliament’s 2003 discharge resolution also contains a number of recommendations related to development policy (recommendations 66-72).
Pre-accession aid PHARE The Commission intends to take measures to ensure that the accreditation process for many PHARE and ISPA agencies in Bulgaria, Romania and the future acceding countries is completed before accession.
The Commission adopted on 27 May 2004 the new IPA draft regulation together with the RELEX package and negotiation is since ongoing in the Council and Parliament (recommendation 74).
SAPARD The Commission believes that it has already put great emphasis on projects which increased quality, health and environmental standards.
The latest report, covering the period up to 31 May 2005, was approved by the Commission and transmitted to Parliament on 4 July 2005.
Implementation and the RAL (recommendations 87-88) An increase in the RAL is normal when taking into account the natural cycle of the EDF.
The level of unspent resources (RAL) rose much less (€400 million) by the end of 2004 and the Commission hopes to reverse the tendency by the end of 2005.
It wants to draw attention to the following points[7]: Regulations and structure of the agencies (recommendations 97-98 and 100-102) The Commission has proposed a draft Interinstitutional Agreement (COM(2005) 59 final) which is now on the table of Council and of the European Parliament.
Cross-cutting analysis of evaluations (recommendation 99) The Commission is willing to carry out regular cross-cutting analyses of the evaluations carried out on individual agencies, as it did in its 2003 'pilot' exercise 'Meta-evaluation of the Community Agency System'.
Updated information on Agencies (recommendation 104) The Commission considers that Parliament’s primary source for obtaining updated information on the Agencies should also in future be the written questions to and hearings of the directors of the Agencies which are an integrated part of the discharge procedure. * * * [1] 2003 General Budget Discharge, 2003 EDF Discharge, 2003 Agencies Discharge.
