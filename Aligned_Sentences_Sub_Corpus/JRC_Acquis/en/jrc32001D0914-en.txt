Article 15 of this Regulation provides for the continuation of the legal tender status of banknotes denominated in national currency units during a maximum period of six months after the end of the transitional period.
The year 2002 should thus be regarded as a special year, since banknotes in circulation denominated in national currency units may still account for a considerable proportion of the total value of Eurosystem banknotes in circulation and with different patterns in Member States.
Decision ECB/2001/15 establishes the allocation of euro banknotes in circulation to the NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in the capital of the ECB.
The same Decision allocates to the ECB 8 % of the total value of euro banknotes in circulation.
Article 2 Intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation 1.
The first calculation of the intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation under the previous paragraph shall be made for frontloaded euro banknotes on 2 January 2002 with a value date of 1 January 2002. 2.
The intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation, including those resulting from the application of Article 4 of this Decision, shall be remunerated at the reference rate. 3.
Article 3 Method for measuring monetary income 1.
The total income accrued by all NCBs on their earmarkable assets, excluding all income arising from net intra-Eurosystem claims resulting from TARGET transactions (Annex II, A.3) and net intra-Eurosystem claims on euro banknotes in circulation including those resulting from the application of Article 4 (Annex II, A.4), shall be divided by the average amount of the total earmarkable assets of the Eurosystem.
Article 4 Adjustments to intra-Eurosystem balances 1.
The sum of the compensatory amounts of the NCBs shall be 0. 3.
In the event that the value of euro banknotes that the Banque centrale du Luxembourg puts into circulation in 2002 exceeds the average value of its banknotes in circulation during the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001 by 25 % or more, letter %quot%A%quot% in the formula of paragraph 1 shall be for the Banque centrale du Luxembourg the value of banknotes put into circulation by the Banque centrale du Luxembourg in 2002 up to a maximum limit of EUR 2,2 billion.
The adjustments to intra-Eurosystem balances provided for in this Article shall cease to apply from 1 January 2008.
Article 5 Calculation and allocation of monetary income 1.
Article 6 Final provisions 1.
This Decision shall enter into force on 1 January 2002. 2.
