2005/729/EC: Council Decision of 7 June 2005 abrogating Decision 2005/136/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in the Netherlands Council Decision of 7 June 2005 abrogating Decision 2005/136/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in the Netherlands (2005/729/EC) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(12) thereof, Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission, Whereas: (1) By Decision 2005/136/EC [1] following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty, the Council decided that an excessive deficit existed in the Netherlands. (2) In accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty, the Council made a Recommendation on 2 June 2004 addressed to the Netherlands with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end.
The outcome for 2004 is in compliance with the Council recommendation issued under Article 104(7) of the Treaty, particularly as regards the reduction of the government deficit below the reference value of 3 % of GDP by 2005 at the latest.
For 2005, the Commission services’ Spring 2005 forecast projects a further decline in the general government deficit to 2,0 % of GDP, largely in response to savings measures, mostly of a structural nature, adding up to 0,5 % of GDP.
For 2006, the Commission services’ Spring 2005 forecast projects, based on currently known policies, a further fall in the deficit to 1,6 % of GDP, pointing to the durable correction of the budget deficit, - the budgetary consolidation will be sustained through a reduction in the cyclically adjusted deficit which is expected to reach close to balance after the excessive deficit has been corrected.
In 2004, the cyclically adjusted deficit fell markedly to 1,2 % of GDP, compared to 2,0 % of GDP in 2003.
Article 2 Decision 2005/136/EC is hereby abrogated.
Article 3 This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
