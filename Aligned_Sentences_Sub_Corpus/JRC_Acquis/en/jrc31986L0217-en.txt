ANNEX 1.2 // 1. // Scope // // For the purposes of this Annex, 'tyre pressure gauges' are instruments not fitted with pre-setting devices used in fixed or mobile installations for inflating motor-vehicle tyres in which a mechanical measuring system transmits the elastic deformation of a sensing element to an indicating device. // // They indicate the pressure difference (Pe) between the air in the tyre and the atmosphere. // // They also include all those parts between the tyre and the sensing element. // 2. // Metrological requirements // 2.1. // Maximum permissible errors // // The maximum permissible positive or negative errors given in the table hereunder are defined as absolute values according to the measured pressure: 1.2 // // // Measured pressure // Maximum permissible errors // // // not exceeding 4 bar // 0,08 bar // above 4 bar but not exceeding 10 bar // 0,16 bar // above 10 bar // 0,25 bar // // 1.2 // // The maximum permissible errors must not be exceeded in the range 15 to 25 °C.
This range is hereinafter termed the 'temperature reference range'. // 2.2. // Variation due to temperature // // The variation in pressure-gauge readings at temperatures lying outside the reference range but between - 10 °C and + 40 °C is given in the table hereunder: 1.2 // // // Measured pressure // Maximum permissible variation // // // not exceeding 4 bar // 0,1 % of 4 bar per degree Celsius // above 4 bar but not exceeding 10 bar // 0,05 % of 10 bar per degree Celsius // above 10 bar // 0,05 % of the upper scale limit per degree Celsius // // 1.2 // 2.3. // Hysteresis error // // Hysteresis error in pressure gauges must not exceed the absolute value of the maximum permissible error, at any temperature within the temperature reference range.
The maximum distance between the index and the plane of the scale marks must not be greater than the length of the scale division and must in no case exceed 2 mm or 0,02 L + 1 mm in the case of circular-dial indicating devices (L being the distance between the axis of rotation of the pointer and its extremity). // 3.2.3. // The scale intervals must be equal over the entire scale.
Variation of scale spacing is permitted if the difference between two consecutive scale spacings does not exceed 20 % of the largest value and if the difference between the smallest and largest scale spacings does not exceed 50 % of the largest value. // // Every fifth mark must be distinguished from the others by its greater length; every fifth or tenth mark must be numbered.
The thickness of the marks must be virtually constant and must not exceed one-fifth (1 / 5) of the scale spacing. // 4. // Inscriptions and marks // 4.1. // Inscriptions // 4.1.1. // Compulsory inscriptions // // Pressure gauges must bear the following inscriptions: // // (a) on the dial: // // - the symbol for the quantity measured, Pe, // // - the symbol for the unit of measurement, bar, // // - where necessary, a sign indicating the working position of the instrument; // // (b) on the dial, data plate or on the instrument itself: // // - manufacturer's identification particulars, // // - identification particulars of the instrument, // // - the EEC pattern approval mark. // // These inscriptions must be directly visible, easily legible and indelible under normal conditions of use and must not impede reading of the instrument indication. // 4.1.2. // Optional inscriptions // // Pressure gauges may also carry additional inscriptions authorized by the competent national authority, provided that they do not impede reading of the instrument indication. // 4.2. // Verification and sealing marks // // A suitable place must be provided for affixing the EEC initial verification marks. // // The pressure gauges must be capable of being sealed in such a way as to render it impossible to alter the characteristics of the instrument. // 5. // EEC pattern approval // // EEC pattern approval of pressure gauges must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Directive 71/361/EEC. // // At least two pressure gauges must be submitted for examination when application is made for pattern approval.
