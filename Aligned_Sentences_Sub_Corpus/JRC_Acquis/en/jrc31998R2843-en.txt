For the Commission Karel VAN MIERT Member of the Commission (1) OJ L 175, 23. 7. 1968, p. 1. (2) OJ L 378, 31. 12. 1986, p. 4. (3) OJ L 374, 31. 12. 1987, p. 1. (4) OJ L 240, 24. 8. 1992, p. 18. (5) OJ L 209, 21. 8. 1969, p. 1. (6) OJ L 376, 31. 12. 1988, p. 1. (7) OJ L 376, 31. 12. 1988, p. 10.
However, Council Regulation No 14 (1) rendered Regulation No 17 inapplicable in the transport sector.
The procedures for implementing the EC competition rules in the transport sector have subsequently been laid down for transport by rail, road and inland waterway in Regulation (EEC) No 1017/68, for maritime transport by Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 and for the air transport sector by Regulation (EEC) No 3975/87 (the references to these and other acts mentioned in this form or relevant to applications made on this form are listed in Appendix II to this form).
Articles 2, 5, 7 and 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1017/68 contain provisions which, with minor variations, mirror those respectively of Articles 85(1), (2) and (3) and 86 of the EC Treaty.
Those provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1017/68 are to be interpreted in the same way as Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty (2). 2.
Article 53(1) of the EEA Agreement (the text of Articles 53, 54 and 56 of the EEA Agreement is reproduced in Appendix I) prohibits restrictive agreements, decisions or concerted practices (arrangements) which may affect trade between the Community and one or more EFTA States (or between EFTA States), and Article 53(2) declares agreements or decisions containing such restrictions void; Article 53(3), however, provides for exemption of arrangements with beneficial effects, if its conditions are met.
The procedures for implementing the EEA competition rules in the transport sector are laid down for transport by rail, road and inland waterway in Regulation (EEC) No 1017/68, for maritime transport by Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 and for the air transport sector by Regulation (EEC) No 3975/87, supplemented for EEA purposes, by Protocols 21, 22 and 23 to the EEA Agreement.
Its purpose is to allow undertakings to ascertain whether the Commission considers that their arrangement or their behaviour is or is not prohibited by Article 85(1), or Article 86 of the EC Treaty or by Article 53(1) or Article 54 of the EEA Agreement.
This procedure is governed by Article 3(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3975/87.
The negative clearance takes the form of a decision by which the Commission certifies that, on the basis of the facts in its possession, there are no grounds pursuant to Article 85(1) or Article 86 of the EC Treaty or under Article 53(1) or Article 54 of the EEA Agreement for action on its part in respect of the arrangement or behaviour.
This procedure is governed by Articles 12 and 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1017/68, Articles 12 and 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 and Articles 5 and 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 3975/87.
The exemption takes the form of a decision by the Commission declaring Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1017/68, Article 85(1) of the EC Treaty or Article 53(1) of the EEA Agreement to be inapplicable to the arrangements described in the decision.
Unless the Commission notifies the applicants within 90 days of the date of such publication that there are serious doubts as to the applicability of Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1017/68, Article 85(3) of the EC Treaty or Article 53(3) of the EEA Agreement, the arrangement will be deemed exempt for the time already elapsed and for a maximum of three years from the date of publication, in the case of applications under Regulation (EEC) No 1017/68, and for a maximum of six years from the date of publication in the case of applications under Regulations (EEC) No 4056/86 and (EEC) No 3975/87.
The Commission has adopted a number of regulations granting exemptions to categories of agreements in the air transport sector and in the maritime sector (5).
A decision granting exemption under Regulations (EEC) No 1017/68, (EEC) No 4056/86 or (EEC) No 3975/87 may have retroactive effect.
The competence of the Commission and of the EFTA Surveillance Authority to apply the EEA competition rules follows from Article 56 of the EEA Agreement.
Applications relating to agreements, decisions or concerted practices liable to affect trade between Member States should be addressed to the Commission unless their effects on trade between Member States or on competition within the Community are not appreciable within the meaning of the Commission notice of 1997 on agreements of minor importance (6).
Furthermore, all restrictive agreements, decisions or concerted practices affecting trade between one Member State and one or more EFTA States fall within the competence of the Commission, provided that the undertakings concerned achieve more than 67 % of their combined EEA-wide turnover within the Community (7).
Applications for negative clearance regarding Article 54 of the EEA Agreement should be lodged with the Commission if the dominant position exists only in the Community, or with the EFTA Surveillance authority, if the dominant position exists only in the whole of the territory of the EFTA States, or a substantial part of it.
Where the case falls under the EEA Agreement and is attributed to the Commission pursuant to Article 56 of that Agreement, it will simultaneously apply the EEA rules.
Applications for exemption pursuant to Regulations (EEC) No 1017/68, (EEC) No 4056/86 and (EEC) No 3975/87 shall be submitted in the manner prescribed by form TR (see Article 2(1) of the Regulation).
This form can also be used by undertakings that wish to apply for a negative clearance from Article 86 of the EC Treaty or Article 53 of the EEA Agreement, pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3975/87.
Notifications under Regulation No 17 of agreements concerning the creation of a cooperative joint venture of a structural character can benefit from an accelerated procedure.
The accelerated procedure is not applied to applications under Regulations (EEC) No 1017/68, (EEC) No 4056/86 and (EEC) No 3975/87 because those Regulations provide for an objections procedure containing a specific timetable.
How to submit an application Applications may be submitted in any of the official languages of the European Union or of an EFTA State (see Articles 2(5) and 6 of the Regulation).
The supporting documents may be originals or copies of the originals (see Article 2(4) of the Regulation).

The application is to be sent to: European Commission Directorate-General for Competition (DG IV), The Registrar Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat 200, B-1049 Brussels, or be delivered by hand during Commission working days and official working hours to the following address: European Commission, Directorate-General for Competition (DG IV), The Registrar Avenue de Cortenberg/Kortenberglaan 158, B-1040 Brussels.
