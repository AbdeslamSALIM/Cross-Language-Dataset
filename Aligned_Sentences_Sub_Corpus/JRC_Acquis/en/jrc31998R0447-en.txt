(5) Where the assets transferred generate turnover, then neither the value of the assets nor that of the turnover may exceed ECU 100 million. (6) See, in particular, Article 122 of the EEA Agreement, Article 9 of Protocol 24 to the EEA Agreement and Article 17(2) of Chapter XIII of Protocol 4 to the Agreement between the EFTA States on the establishment of a Surveillance Authority and a Court of Justice (ESA Agreement). (7) This includes the target company in the case of a contested bid, in which case the details should be completed as far as is possible. (8) See Commission notice on the concept of undertakings concerned. (9) See, generally, the Commission notice on calculation of turnover.
The same will apply in 8.5 in relation with customers. (17) Research and development intensity is defined as research development expenditure as a proportion of turnover. (18) For market definitions refer to Section 6. (19) OJ L 377, 31.12.1994, p. 28. (20) OJ L 180, 9.7.1997, p. 1.
Aggregate worldwide turnover is replaced by the value of gross premiums written worldwide, the sum of which is ECU 5 300 million. 2.
Community-wide turnover is replaced, for each insurance undertakings, by the value of gross premiums written with Community residents.
For each of the insurance undertakings, this amount is more than ECU 250 million. 3.
For insurance A, it achieves 80 % of its gross premiums written with Community residents within Member State X, whereas for insurance B, it achieves 90 % of its gross premiums written with Community residents in that Member State X.
GUIDANCE NOTE II Calculation of turnover for joint undertakings A.
Existence of a joint undertaking (Article 5(5)) For the calculation of turnover in case of the existence of a joint undertaking C between two undertakings A and B concerned in a concentration, we give the following example: I.
Calculation of turnover (a) Undertaking A's aggregate worldwide turnover shall be calculated as follows: ECU 10 000 million and 50 % of C's worldwide turnover with third undertakings (i.e.
Undertaking B achieves ECU 925 million within Member State Y (50 % of C's turnover in this Member State taken into account), and a Community-wide turnover of ECU 1 530 million (including 50 % of C's Community-wide turnover).
Conclusion Since (a) the aggregate worldwide turnover of undertakings A and B is more than ECU 5 000 million; (b) each of the undertakings concerned by the concentration achieves more than ECU 250 million within the Community; c) each of the undertakings concerned (undertaking A 50,1 % and undertaking B 60,5 %) achieves less than two thirds of its Community-wide turnover in one (and the same) Member State Y; the proposed concentration would fall under the scope of the Regulation.
Consolidated profit and loss accounts %gt%TABLE%gt% %gt%TABLE%gt% Example 2(b) Same figures as in example 2(a) but undertaking B achieves ECU 300 million in Member State Y.
Turnover in one (and the same) Member State X is, for undertaking A (ECU 6 000 million), 75 % of its Community-wide turnover and is, for undertaking B (ECU 200 million), 50 % of its Community-wide-turnover. 3.
Conclusion: In this case, although undertaking A achieves more than two thirds of its Community-wide turnover in Member State X, the proposed concentration would fall under the scope of the Regulation due to the fact that undertaking B achieves less than two thirds of its Community-wide turnover in Member State X.
