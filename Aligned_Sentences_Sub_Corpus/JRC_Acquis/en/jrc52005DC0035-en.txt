Benefits and Costs of Limiting Climate Change 4 4.
On the basis of the analysis undertaken by the Commission, it recommends a number of elements which should be included in the EU’s future climate change strategies and proposes dialogue with key partners during 2005 in order to prepare the EU’s position for future international negotiations.
As a consequence, global temperatures are expected to increase by 1.4 to 5.8°C by the year 2100 (compared to 1990 temperatures) and by 2.0 to 6.3°C in Europe.
In the coming decades, the share of EU-25 emissions in world greenhouse gas emissions is expected to decline to less than 10 %, while those of developing countries will expand to more than half of the total.
Even when considering historic and future emissions together, the cumulative contributions of developed and developing countries are projected to reach parity between 2030 and 2065. [pic] Thus, even if the EU were to cut its emissions by 50 % by 2050, atmospheric concentrations would not be significantly affected, unless other major emitters also made substantial emission cuts.
Indeed a relatively small group – EU, US, Canada, Russia, Japan, China and India – accounts for about 75 % of world greenhouse gas emissions.
It might be worthwhile to try to accelerate progress at the global level by discussing reductions among this smaller group of major emitters in a forum similar to the G8, in parallel with vigorous efforts to reach agreement in the UN context. 5.
The European experience shows that active support policies have helped to radically reduce unit costs of producing electricity from renewable energy sources in the years 1980-1995 (-65 % for photovoltaics, -82 % for wind power, -85 % for electricity from biomass).
A recent study identified the 15 most promising of such technologies (see Annex 3).
The inclusion of adaptation policies: More resources need to be allocated in the EU to adapt effectively to climate change.
The adaptation efforts of the poorest and worst-affected countries should be financially supported. 8.
Climate friendly development policies should be drawn up in co-operation with developing countries, in particular in the areas of energy and air quality.
