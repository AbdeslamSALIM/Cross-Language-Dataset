Proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters relating to the provisional application of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community, on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, on the other /* COM/2006/0727 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 27.11.2006 COM(2006) 727 final Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters relating to the provisional application of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community, on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, on the other (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM The European Community has a longstanding relation with Greenland on fisheries.
The first pillar regarding the broader cooperation arrangement will take the form of a Council Decision and a Joint Declaration providing up to EUR 25 million per year to Greenland on the basis of cooperation in other areas than fisheries.
The financial contribution is fixed at EUR 15,847,244 per year including a financial reserve of EUR 1,540,000 which will be paid in case the Community receives fishing opportunities for cod and/or capelin in addition to the quotas already set out in the Annex.
The financial contribution for the fishing opportunities in the first protocol under this new Fisheries Partnership Agreement is based on the following changes compared to the modified Fourth Protocol under the Fisheries Agreement from 1985: - reduction of the redfish, Greenland halibut East and snow crab quota in accordance with the scientific advice; - increase in the quotas of Greenland halibut West of 1,000 tonnes and the shrimp East by 1,325 tonnes; - removal of the direct fishery for roundnose grenadier in accordance with scientific advice as well as underutilisation by only allowing by-catches of this species; - introduction of a cod quota of 1,000 tonnes in 2007 to be increased to 3,500 tonnes from 2008 and onwards; - increase in the by-catch quota due to the introduction of the cod quota and Greenland requirements on by-catch quotas.
Article 2 The allocation of fishing opportunities including licences obtained under the Agreement referred to in Article 1 shall be conducted in accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EC) Nr. 2371/2002.
Article 4 The President of the Council is hereby authorized to designate the persons empowered to sign the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters in order to bind the Community.
