Accordingly, the Commission Decision accepting the undertaking was repealed by Decision 2004/255/EC [7]. (5) In February 2004, an anti-absorption investigation concerning imports of the sulphanilic acid originating in the PRC was concluded by Council Regulation (EC) No 236/2004 [8], which increased the rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty for the PRC from 21 % to 33,7 % ("the anti-absorption investigation"). 2.
Request for an interim review (6) In December 2004, after conclusion of the anti-absorption investigation, the company lodged a request for a partial interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 19 of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation respectively, limited in scope to the examination of the acceptability of the reinstatement of its undertaking. (7) The company argued that its original wish to withdraw the undertaking followed from the fact that after imposition of measures in 2002, Chinese exporters absorbed the anti-dumping duties imposed, which resulted in a price depression and made the undertaking unworkable.
