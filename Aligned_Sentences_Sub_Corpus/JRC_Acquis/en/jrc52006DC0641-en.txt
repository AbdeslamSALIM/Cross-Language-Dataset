Report from the Commission to the European Parliament on the follow-up to 2004 Discharge Decisions (Summary) - European Parliament Resolutions {SEC(2006) 1376} /* COM/2006/0641 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 24.10.2006 COM(2006) 641 final REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT on the follow-up to 200 4 Discharge Decisions (Summary) - European Parliament Resolutions {SEC(2006) 1376} TABLE OF CONTENTS PREAMBLE 3 I - COMMISSION RESPONSES TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE EP IN THE GENERAL BUDGET DISCHARGE RESOLUTION 4 a) Horizontal issues 4 b) Sectoral issues: 5 II - EP DISCHARGE ON EDF 9 III – Recommendations in the resolutions concerning individual AGENCIES 10 PREAMBLE Due to translation constraints, the Commission's report on the follow-up to European Parliament (EP) Discharges given for the 2004 financial year[1] is being published in all EU official languages in this summarised form.
The Commission’s full answers to each specific recommendation by the Parliament are available in a Commission working document[2] which is published in English, French and German.
Both these follow-up reports relate to the resolutions adopted by the European Parliament on 27 April 2006.
In the discharge decisions for the general budget, the EDF and the Agencies, the Commission has identified a total of 150 recommendations made by the European Parliament to the Commission.
The Commission considers that for 51 recommendations the required action has already been taken, though in some cases results of the actions will need to be examined.
For another 85 recommendations the Commission agrees to take the action recommended by Parliament.
Finally, the Commission cannot accept 14 recommendations and will therefore not be taking the requested action[5].
These accounts were presented on time to the Court of Auditors on 31 March 2006, as required by the Financial Regulation.
The first half-yearly progress report to Parliament and Council was issued on 19 July 2006 (SEC(2006) 1001).
Declarations (Commission working document, points 12-20) As part of the Action Plan, the Commission has promoted operational level management declarations and synthesis reports at national level.
The conclusion to the 2005 synthesis report states this more explicitly.
The measures taken are described in the reports from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of the GNP Directive (COM (96)124 final of 27.03.1996) and of the GNI Regulation (COM (2006) 199 final of 8.05.2006).
So as to extend post-payment checks to as many Member States as possible in order to obtain reasonable assurance on compliance with Community legislation the Commission carried out 10 audits in 2004 and 2005.
The Commission has responded to the recommendation of tabling proposals to avoid that the premiums of the major instrument for afforestation largely exceed the funds allocated by proposing a reduction of the aid ceilings and a shortening of the maximum period to compensate income foregone resulting from the afforestation of agricultural land from 20 to 10 years.
The regulations for the 2007-2013 period require the Member States to submit to the Commission, a description of the management and control system and an assessment of its compliance with requirements before lodging the first interim payment claim and at the latest within 12 months of the approval of programmes.
In addition, the workshop of June 2005 on simplification, with participation of the Court of Auditors, representatives of Member States and stakeholders, helped to consolidate these proposals and to identify further actions.
A further conference on simplification with representatives of participants in Community-funded RTD projects was held in September 2005 and a dedicated web site was established to consult participants and gather their views.
The Commission’s proposal for the EC Rules for participation, adopted on 23 December 2005, includes the first set of rules reflecting these discussions[8].
External actions (Commission working document, points 83-102) The Commission has continued its efforts to improve its supervisory and control systems and the management of risk in the field of external actions.
The European Parliament’s 2004 discharge resolution also contains a number of recommendations on development policy, relations with the United Nations, as well as on the Court of Auditors’ special reports concerning the devolution of EC external aid management to the Commission Delegations (SR 10/2004), concerning EDF budget aid to ACP countries (SR 2/2005) and concerning the Commission’s management of economic cooperation in Asia (SR 4/2005).
Administrative expenditure and issues concerning the agencies (Commission working document, points 105-112 and 138-150) The European Parliament has made a number of recommendations to the Commission concerning the regulatory agencies in the discharge resolution for the general budget as well as in the discharge resolutions for the individual agencies.
The agencies’ framework Financial Regulation (2343/2002) has been adopted on the basis of the general Financial Regulation and most provisions are therefore in line.
The Accounting Officer will check at the latest by 15 October if CRIS will be accrual compliant before the end of 2006.
Before the end of 2007 all funds from the 9th EDF - including funds transferred from earlier EDFs - should be committed, and payments are currently at the highest level ever.
The indicator showing the average time needed to implement projects has fallen from 5 ½ years in 2000 to around 4 years in 2005.
