Recommendation for a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in Portugal prepared in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty /* SEC/2005/0992 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 20.7.2005 COM(2005) 992 final Recommendation for a COUNCIL DECISION on the existence of an excessive deficit in Portugal prepared in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM On 9 June 2005, Portugal submitted the most recent update of its stability programme covering the period 2005-2009.
Over the same years, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to further increase from a reported figure of 61.9% in 2004 to a peak of 67.8% of GDP in 2007.
The planned government deficit in 2005, revealed in the June 2005 update of the Portuguese stability programme, is in excess of the 3% of GDP reference value and not close to it.
In fact, the June 2005 update of the Portuguese stability programme foresees the government deficit to narrow over the coming years, but to exceed the reference value until 2007.
The debt targets for the years 2005 to 2007 contained in the June 2005 stability programme update, and largely in line with the debt projections of the Commission services Spring 2005 forecast, suggest a further sharp increase in the debt ratio and up to a peak of just below 68% in 2007.
In the case of Portugal, this condition is not met: the planned deficit for 2005 is not close to the reference value and the excess over the reference value cannot be considered temporary, since the government deficit is projected to be above 3% of GDP for three years.
Article 104(4) of the Treaty states that “the Committee provided for in Article 114 (i.e.
The Committee issued its opinion on 4 July 2005, which is consistent with the assessment made by the Commission in its report.
In particular, the Committee concluded “that the planned budgetary developments in Portugal in 2005 are such that both criteria in the second paragraph of Article 104 are not respected”.
The Committee considered that deficit planned for 2005 is not close to the 3% of GDP reference value, and its excess over the reference value cannot be considered exceptional and temporary.
This opinion, adopted by the Commission on 20 July 2005, has been addressed to the Council, according to Article 104(5) of the Treaty.
According to Article 104 of the Treaty Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits. 2.
In delivering its assessment, the Commission took into account the 20 March 2005 Ecofin Report to the European Council on ‘Improving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact’, endorsed by the latter on 22 March 2005[7]. 5.
In fact, the June 2005 update of the Portuguese stability programme foresees the government deficit to narrow over the coming years, but to exceed the reference value until 2007.
Moreover, the projected debt figures for the years 2005 to 2007, contained in the June 2005 stability programme update, and broadly in line with the debt projections of the Commission services Spring 2005 forecast, suggest a further sharp increase in the debt ratio up to a peak of just below 68% in 2007.
Therefore, for the purpose of the Council decision in accordance with Article 104(6), other relevant factors are not taken into account in the case of Portugal.
Article 2 This decision is addressed to the Portuguese Republic.
