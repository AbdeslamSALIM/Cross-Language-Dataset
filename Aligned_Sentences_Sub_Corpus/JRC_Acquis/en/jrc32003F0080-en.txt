The criminal penalties provided for in paragraph 1 may be accompanied by other penalties or measures, in particular the disqualification for a natural person from engaging in an activity requiring official authorisation or approval, or founding, managing or directing a company or a foundation, where the facts having led to his or her conviction show an obvious risk that the same kind of criminal activity may be pursued.
Article 6 Liability of legal persons 1.
Article 7 Sanctions for legal persons Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to ensure that a legal person held liable pursuant to Article 6 is punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, which shall include criminal or non-criminal fines and may include other sanctions such as: (a) exclusion from entitlement to public benefits or aid; (b) temporary or permanent disqualification from the practice of industrial or commercial activities; (c) placing under judicial supervision; (d) a judicial winding-up order; (e) the obligation to adopt specific measures in order to avoid the consequences of conduct such as that on which the criminal liability was founded.
