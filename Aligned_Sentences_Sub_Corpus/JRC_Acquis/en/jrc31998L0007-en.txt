Directive as amended by Directive 90/88/EEC (OJ L 61, 10.3.1990, p. 14).
A year is presumed to have 365 days or 365,25 days or (for leap years) 366 days, 52 weeks or 12 equal months.
CALCULATION OF THE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE OF CHARGE ON A CALENDAR BASIS (1 YEAR = 365 DAYS (OR 366 DAYS FOR LEAP YEARS)) First example Sum loaned: S = ECU 1 000 on 1 January 1994.
It is repaid in a single payment of ECU 1 200 made on 1 July 1995 i.e. 1 ½ years or 546 (= 365 + 181) days after the date of the loan.
The equation becomes: %gt%TABLE%gt% or: %gt%TABLE%gt% This amount will be rounded to 13 % (or 12,96 % if an accuracy of two decimal places is preferred).
Second example The sum loaned is S = ECU 1 000, but the creditor retains ECU 50 for administrative expenses, so that the loan is in fact ECU 950; the repayment of ECU 1 200, as in the first example, is again made on 1 July 1995.
The equation becomes: %gt%TABLE%gt% or: %gt%TABLE%gt% This amount will be rounded to 16,9 %.
The equation becomes: %gt%TABLE%gt% It is solved by algebra and produces i = 0,1306623 rounded to 13,1 % (or 13,07 % if an accuracy of two decimal places is preferred).
Fourth example The sum loaned is S = ECU 1 000, on 1 January 1994, and the amounts to be paid by the borrower are: %gt%TABLE%gt% The equation becomes: %gt%TABLE%gt% This equation allows i to be calculated by successive approximations, which can be programmed on a pocket calculator.
The result is i = 0,13226 rounded to 13,2 % (or 13,23 % if an accuracy of two decimal places is preferred).
CALCULATION OF THE ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE OF CHARGE ON THE BASIS OF A STANDARD YEAR (1 YEAR = 365 DAYS OR 365,25 DAYS, 52 WEEKS, OR 12 EQUAL MONTHS) First example Sum loaned: S = ECU 1 000.
It is repaid in a single payment of ECU 1 200 made in 1,5 years (i.e. 1,5 × 365 = 547,5 days, 1,5 × 365,25 = 547,875 days, 1,5 × 366 = 549 days, 1,5 × 12 = 18 months, or 1,5 × 52 = 78 weeks) after the date of the loan.
The equation becomes: %gt%TABLE%gt% or: %gt%TABLE%gt% This amount will be rounded to 12,9 % (or 12,92 % if an accuracy of two decimal places is preferred).
The equation becomes: %gt%TABLE%gt% or: %gt%TABLE%gt% This amount will be rounded to 16,9 % (or 16,85 % if an accuracy of two decimal places is preferred).
The equation becomes: %gt%TABLE%gt% It is solved by algebra and produces i = 0,13066 which will be rounded to 13,1 % (or 13,07 % if an accuracy of two decimal places is preferred).
The result is i = 0,13185 which will be rounded to 13,2 % (or 13,19 % if an accuracy of two decimal places is preferred).`
