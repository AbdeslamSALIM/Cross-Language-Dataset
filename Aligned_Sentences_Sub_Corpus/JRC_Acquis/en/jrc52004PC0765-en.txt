It is therefore proposed that the Council adopt the attached proposal for a Regulation which should be published in the Official Journal no later than 18 December 2004.
PROCEDURE (1) By Decision 2730/2000/ECSC([2]), the Commission imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of €32.6 per tonne on imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm (‘coke 80+’) originating in the People’s Republic of China (the ‘PRC’), falling within CN code ex 2704 00 19 (TARIC code 2704 00 19 10). (2) By Decision 2004/264/EC([3]) (the ‘Decision’), the Commission suspended the definitive anti-dumping duty for a period of nine months, with effect from 20 March 2004.
In addition to the analysis of the imports from the PRC, a questionnaire was sent to all parties concerned requesting data on production, sales in volume and in prices on the Community market and profitability for 2003 and the first six months in 2004. (5) Replies were received from both the complainant and user industries.
Imports from the PRC (6) As to the volume of imports into the Community from the PRC, it was found that during the first six months of 2004 the volume of imports of the product concerned had decreased by 4% compared to the same period in 2003.
Indeed, in this case the comparison of the volume of imports between January and June 2004 and the last six months of 2003 shows a decrease of 11%. (7) With regard to prices, the average price of coke 80+ during the first 6 months in 2004 increased by 107% compared to the average price in 2003.
Based on Eurostat, total imports from these countries were 924 602 tonnes compared to 318 005 tonnes from the PRC in 2003.
Situation of the Community producers (9) The production among the Community producers (EU-15) increased from 442 397 tonnes in 2003 to an estimated 543 920 tonnes in 2004, i.e.
The Community industry seems to have started to recover relatively well from the previous injurious situation, as the average profit was 8.5% in 2003 and 12.4% at the end of June 2004. (10) With regard to the new EU Member States, production of coke 80+ is concentrated mainly in Poland and the Czech Republic.
EU-25 production among the co-operating companies increased by 30% from 2003 to 2004.
The average profit for EU-25 producers was 13% in 2003 and 19.1% in 2004.
The volume of Chinese coke purchased by these users decreased from 158 730 tonnes in 2003 to an estimated volume of 65 114 tonnes in 2004, i.e.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
