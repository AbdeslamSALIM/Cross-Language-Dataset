Member States wishing to have an eligible variety of rice included in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 3878/87 shall submit to the Commission, not later than 31 July of each year, an application stating the name of the variety and its reference in the national catalogue of agricultural plant varieties. 2.
The sample, weighing at least 5 kg, shall have been produced during that year in one of the areas listed in Annex A to Regulation (EEC) No 3878/87.
Each sample sent to the laboratories for analysis shall consist of at least 100 grams of husked rice, and at least 750 grams of milled rice.
The Commission staff shall inform the Member States of the results of the analyses before 31 March of each year.
Article 5 This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

ANNEX I METHODS OF ANALYSIS A.
QUALITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS (a) Standardized procedure for the use of the Instron Food Tester to determine the glutinosity of cooked rice 1.
Purpose This method may be used for assessing the glutinosity of cooked rice with the Instron Food Tester. 2.
Wholly milled rice: as defined in paragraph 1 (d) of Annex A to Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76. 4.
Balance, accurate to 0,1 grams 5.7.
Glass rod. 5.8.
Watch glasses, 6 cm in diameter. 5.9.
Preparation for cooking For each determination: prepare two beakers (5.4) by introducing into each a sample of 8 grams of wholly milled rice (entire grains only), weighed to within 0,1 grams, with 12 ml of distilled water.
Stir gently with the glass rod (5.7), cover the beakers with watch glasses (5.8). 6.3.
After 20 minutes turn off the heat and leave everything undisturbed for 10 minutes.
Adjustment of the Instron Food Tester Adjust the Instron Food Tester (5.1) according to the manufacturer's instructions, ensuring that the response of the loading cell corresponds to values between 0 and 640 grams and the speed to 0,5 cm/min. 6.5.
Cause the piston to descend at a constant speed of 0,5 cm/min, until the compression force on the rice registers 640 grams.
The area represents the effort expressed in grams Ã— cm. 7.
Purpose This method may be used for assessing the consistency of cooked rice with the Instron Food Tester. 2.
Consistency: resistance to mastication of cooked rice. 3.2.
Wholly milled rice: as defined in paragraph 1 (d) of Annex A to Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76. 4.
Balance, accurate to 0,1 grams. 5.7.
Glass rod. 5.8.
Plastic bags or other recipients capable of containing 17 grams of cooked rice and preventing dehydration thereof. 6.
Preparation for cooking For each determination: prepare two beakers (5.4) by introducing into each a sample of 20 grams of wholly milled rice (entire grains only), weighed to within 0,1 grams, with 38 ml of distilled water.
After 20 minutes turn off the heat and leave everything undisturbed for 10 minutes.
Adjustment of the Instron Food Tester Adjust the Instron Food Tester (5.1) according to the manufacturer's instructions, ensuring that the response of the loading cell corresponds to values between 5 and 10 kg and the speed to 10 cm/min. 6.5.
Measurement with the Instron Food Tester Remove the cooked rice and prepare six samples weighing 17 grams each, three for each of the two beakers, weighed to within 0,1 grams, keeping them in the plastic bags (5.11) until they are to be measured.
Place one sample in the Ottawa cell (5.2) and cause the piston (5.3) to descend at a speed of 10 cm/min, recording continuously the effort required to extrude the sample of cooked rice.
