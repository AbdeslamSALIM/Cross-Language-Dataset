BACKGROUND Date of transmission of the proposal to the EP and the Council (COM(2003) 621 –2003/0252(COD)) | 3 December 2003 | Date of the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee: | 31 March 2004 | Date of the opinion of the European Parliament, first reading: | 23 February 2005 | Date of adoption of the common position: | 18 September 2006 | 2.
COMMENTS ON THE COMMON POSITION The Council adopted its common position by a qualified majority on 18 September 2006.
Article 7(2) has been amended so that driving licences may be issued with a validity of up to 15 years.
Apart from this specific point, the other items under discussion between the three institutions which were the subject of a compromise incorporated in the common position concern: - the exchange of existing driving licences within 20 years of the date of entry into force of the directive (Article 3(3)); - progressive access to motorcycles, in particular an interval of 2 years from moving from one category to another, and direct access from 24 years of age.
The designations of the categories of motorcycles remain those suggested by the Commission in its initial proposal (Article 4(3) and (6)); - the principle of a single driving licence with the aim of combating fraud and preventing “driving licence tourism” (Article 7(5)); - vehicles with trailers : provision is made for one day’s training or a practical test for all combinations between 3 500 kg and 4 250 kg and where the trailer exceeds 750 kg (Article 4(4)(b)).
It welcomes the fact that it reflects the state of the interinstitutional negotiations, paving the way for the adoption of this proposal on second reading.
