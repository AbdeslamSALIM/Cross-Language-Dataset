General context On 28 January 2005, the Commission adopted the Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on a Community Strategy Concerning Mercury[1].
In the first instance the Commission will explore the scope for an agreement with industry .” On 24 June 2005, the Council adopted its Conclusions on the Mercury Strategy.
By its 2005 Decision on chemicals management, the Governing Council requested governments, the private sector and international organisations to take " immediate action to reduce the risk to human health and the environment posed on a global scale by mercury in products and production processes " such as, inter alia , " considering curbing primary production and the introduction into commerce of excess mercury supply "[3].
The Commission will further develop its action in the international field by organising a global mercury conference on supply and demand issues on 26/27 October 2006 in Brussels, well in advance of the 2007 UNEP Governing Council (GC).
In addition, a further stakeholder meeting took place in Brussels on 8 September 2005.
In accordance with the recent judgments of the ECJ in cases C-94/03 and C-178/03 concerning the approval of the Rotterdam Convention and Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals, the proposal builds on both Articles 133 and 175 ECT.
Both the Rotterdam Convention and Regulation No 304/2003 are characterised by a mix of environmental and trade policy elements very similar to this Proposal. 3.2.
Article 2 sets the storage obligation and defines its scope.
Article 3 clarifies the interface with existing waste legislation.
Article 3 therefore proposes to derogate from these provisions with regard to two specific storage options for metallic mercury, namely underground storage in salt mines adapted for the purpose and temporary storage in facilities specifically dedicated for the purpose, which can be considered – under appropriate conditions – as safe for human health and the environment.
Article 4 complements Article 2 by adding some more detailed requirements for the application of the two storage options.
Article 5 stipulates the creation of an information exchange between interested stakeholders, organised by the Commission.
Article 6 imposes some information obligations on the Member States.
Article 7 stipulates that the Commission will assess the application of the Regulation and its effects on the market and deliver a report at the latest four years after the entry into force of the export ban.
Article 9 is standard text concerning the entry into force of the instrument. 2006/0206 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL on the banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 133 and 175(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[11], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[12], Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[13], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[14], Whereas: (1) Mercury releases are recognised as a global threat that warrants action at national, regional and global level. (2) In accordance with the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council “Community Strategy Concerning Mercury”[15], it is necessary to reduce the risk of exposure to mercury for humans and the environment.. (3) Measures taken at Community level must be seen as part of a global effort to reduce the risk of exposure to mercury, in particular in the framework of the Mercury Programme under the United Nations Environment Programme. (4) The export of metallic mercury from the Community should be banned in order to significantly reduce the global mercury supply. (5) The export ban will result in considerable amounts of surplus mercury in the Community that should be prevented from re-entering the market.
Article 1 is trade–related and therefore based on Article 133 of the Treaty, whereas the other Articles are based on Article 175(1). (13) The objective of reducing exposure to mercury by means of an export ban and a storage obligation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, given the impact on the movement of goods and the functioning of the common market as well as the trans-boundary nature of mercury pollution and can therefore only be achieved at Community level.
The Community may therefore adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
Article 2 From the date set out in Article 1, metallic mercury that is no longer used in the chlor-alkali industry, mercury gained from the cleaning of natural gas and mercury gained as a by-product from non-ferrous mining and smelting operations shall be stored, in the quality and concentration in a way that is safe for human health and the environment.
The permit referred to in Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 1999/31/ECfor the underground salt mine or the facility exclusively dedicated to and equipped for the temporary storage of metallic mercury shall include requirements for regular visual inspections of the containers and the installation of appropriate vapour detection equipment to detect any leak.
Article 5 The Commission shall organise an exchange of information between Member States and the industries concerned.
That exchange of information shall in particular examine the potential need for extending the export ban to mercury compounds and products containing mercury, for extending the storage obligation to metallic mercury from other sources and for time limits concerning storage in a facility specifically dedicated to and equipped for the temporary storage of metallic mercury Article 6 1.
Member States shall, by 30 November 2014 at the latest, inform the Commission on the application and market effects of this Regulation in their respective territory.
The Commission shall assess the application and market effects of this Regulation in the Community, taking into account the information referred to in Article 6. 2.
Article 8 At least one year before the date set out in Article 1, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and the Council on progress in multilateral activities and negotiations on mercury, assessing in particular the consistency of the timing and scope of the measures specified in this Regulation with international developments.
Article 9 This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
