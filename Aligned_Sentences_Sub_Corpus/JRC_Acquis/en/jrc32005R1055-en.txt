Adherence to the medium-term budgetary objective should allow Member States to deal with normal cyclical fluctuations while keeping the government deficit below the 3 % of GDP reference value and ensure rapid progress towards fiscal sustainability.
Taking these factors into account, for Member States that have adopted the euro and for ERM2 Member States the country-specific medium-term budgetary objectives shall be specified within a defined range between Ã¢&#x20AC;&#x201C; 1 % of GDP and balance or surplus, in cyclically adjusted terms, net of one-off and temporary measures.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
