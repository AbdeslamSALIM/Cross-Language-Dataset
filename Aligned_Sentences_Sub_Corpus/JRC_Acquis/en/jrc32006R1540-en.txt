(2) Member States are facing various and sometimes persisting difficulties in the finalisation of the measures necessary for the application of the aid schemes provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
The integration of the regimes for olive oil and sugar into the Single Payment Scheme in year 2006 has caused further difficulties for those Member States that introduced that aid scheme the previous year. (3) It is therefore appropriate, as an exceptional measure in 2006, to authorise the Member States, in conformity to Article 28(3)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, to provide for an advance of the payments listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
In respect of year 2006, the Member States are authorised to pay to the farmer, from 16 October 2006, an advance of the payments under the support schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 2.
Payments provided for in paragraph 1, made before 1 December 2006, shall not exceed 50 % of the amount referred to in paragraph 2.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
