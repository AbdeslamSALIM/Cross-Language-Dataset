Due to the refinement of the gear categorisations the reduction in days available in the Kattegat and Skagerrak has been from 22 days in 2004 to 12 days with a square mesh window or 9 days without, which represents a very significant decrease in fishing effort.
It is estimated that the total black scabbard catch in the waters of the Azores will amount to 700 tonnes generating catches of deep-sea sharks of approximately 120 tonnes.
In accordance with the procedure provided for in the Agreement on fisheries and the marine environment between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland [6], the Community has held consultations on fishing rights for 2005 with Iceland.
The Greenland authorities have notified the Commission that the Community has access to 1 000 tonnes of snow crab in Greenland waters. 4.
It is not in conformity with Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 423/2004 of 26 February 2004 establishing measures for the recovery of cod stocks [7] to allocate more days of fishing per calendar month in the North Sea when fishing with towed gears with 120 mm square mesh windows.
The fishing opportunities for deep-sea sharks in ICES sub-area X (Community waters and international waters) should be increased to 120 tonnes thereby allowing deep-sea sharks that are taken as unavoidable by-catches in other fisheries to be landed. 6.
The rules on the interactions of fishing between areas defined in Annex IVa and Annex IVc to Council Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 should not prevent a vessel from using the maximum number of days avaliable in Annex IVa.
Council Regulation (EC) No 2270/2004 of 22 December 2004 fixes for 2005 and 2006 the fishing opportunities for Community fishing vessels for certain deep-sea stocks[8] 8.
The fishing opportunities for roundnose grenadier in ICES division Vb, sub-areas VI and VII (Community waters and international waters) were inappropriately calculated in Regulation (EC) No 2270/2004 and should be corrected. 9.
Community vessels are hereby authorised to make catches, within the quota limits set out in Annex I, in waters falling within the fisheries jurisdiction of the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland and Norway, and the fishing zone around Jan Mayen, subject to the conditions set out in Articles 9, 16 and 17.’ (2) In Article 9 the following paragraph is added: ‘Fishing by Community vessels in waters under the jurisdiction of Iceland shall be limited to the area defined by straight lines sequentially connecting the following coordinates: South Western Area 1. 63°12'N and 23°05'W through 62°00'N and 26°00'W, 2. 62°58'N and 22°25'W, 3. 63°06'N and 21°30'W, 4. 63°03'N and 21°00'W from there 180°00'S; South Eastern Area 1. 63°14'N and 10°40'W, 2. 63°14'N and 11°23'W, 3. 63°35'N and 12°21'W, 4. 64°00'N and 12°30'W, 5. 63°53'N and 13°30'W, 6. 63°36'N and 14°30'W, 7. 63°10'N and 17°00'W from there 180°00'S.’ (3) Annexes IC, III, IVa and VI are amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.

Article 3 Entry into force This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
The number of days in which a vessel is present within the global area constituted by the areas defined in point 2 of this Annex and in point 2 of Annex IVa shall not exceed the number shown in Table I of this Annex.
