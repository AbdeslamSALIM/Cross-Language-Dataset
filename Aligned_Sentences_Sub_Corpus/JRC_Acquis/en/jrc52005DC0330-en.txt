Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament - Common Actions for Growth and Employment : The Community Lisbon Programme [SEC(2005) 981] /* COM/2005/0330 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 20.7.2005 COM(2005) 330 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT Common Actions for Growth and Employment:The Community Lisbon Programme[SEC(2005) 981] COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT Common Actions for Growth and Employment:The Community Lisbon Programme A MESSAGE OF CONFIDENCE AND DETERMINATION The message at the heart of the Lisbon partnership for growth and employment is one of confidence and determination: the challenges facing Europe’s society, economy and environment are surmountable.
The goal of the Lisbon partnership for growth and employment is to modernize our economy in order to secure our unique social model in the face of increasingly global markets, technological change, environmental pressures, and an ageing population.
The European Council also invited the Commission to present, as a counterpart to the national programmes a “ Community Lisbon Programme ” covering all actions at Community level.
As far as the Community level is concerned, the report will be based on regular monitoring of the actions listed in this Community Lisbon Programme.
The EU Annual Progress Report will also evaluate the implementation of Member States’ national programmes.
It will in particular concentrate on a number of key actions with high value-added: - the support of knowledge and innovation in Europe, - the reform of the state aid policy, - the improvement and simplification of the regulatory framework in which business operates, - the completion of the Internal Market for services, - the completion of an ambitious agreement in the Doha round, - the removal of obstacles to physical, labour and academic mobility, - the development of a common approach to economic migration, - the support of efforts to deal with the social consequences of economic restructuring.
The horizontal contribution of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) in terms of financing– particularly through the EIB’s Innovation 2010 Initiative - should also be emphasized.
Altogether, the reform will improve the general conditions for innovation in a simpler administrative framework for Member States.
The Community will support efforts to maintain a strong industrial capacity by jointly addressing research, regulatory and financing challenges at the European level where, for reasons of scale or scope, individual Member States cannot successfully tackle market and public-policy failures in isolation.
Making Europe a more attractive place to invest and work In order to attract more investment, generate employment and accelerate growth, it is important to facilitate market-entry within sectors and between Member States.
The completion of a single market in services should lead to an increase in the GDP level by 0.6% and of the employment level by 0.3% (up to 600.000 jobs) in the medium term.
The full integration of financial markets will also contribute to raising output and employment by allowing more efficient allocation of capital and creating better conditions for business finance.
Community funds and regulation will complement national efforts to promote the interconnection, interoperability and accessibility of national networks.
These objectives and priorities are also at the core of the recently launched Social Agenda [10] and are reflected in the integrated guidelines for growth and jobs.
The Commission intends to support universities and providers of tertiary education in their efforts to contribute more fully to achieving the Lisbon goals, for example by mobilising all sources of EU funding for their modernisation, and by strengthening cooperation under the Education and Training 2010 programme to complement the Bologna process.
It will also be essential to align cohesion and rural development policy more closely with the Lisbon partnership for growth and employment.
In the spirit of the partnership for growth and jobs and in order to implement this Programme successfully, the European Commission will work closely together with the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers and draw on the expertise of other EU institutions, such as the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and, in the financial field, the European Investment Bank .
