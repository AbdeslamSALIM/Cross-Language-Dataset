Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of perfluorooctane sulfonates (amendment of Council Directive 76/769/EEC) (COM(2005) 618 final — 2005/0244 (COD)) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of perfluorooctane sulfonates (amendment of Council Directive 76/769/EEC) (COM(2005) 618 final — 2005/0244 (COD)) (2006/C 195/03) On 17 January 2006 the Council decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned proposal.
At its 427th plenary session, held on 17 and 18 May 2006 (meeting of 17 May), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 126 votes with 2 abstentions. 1.
Conclusions and recommendations 1.1 The proposal follows an announcement by the leading manufacturer of perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS) that it would cease to manufacture and market consumer products based on these entities.
The EESC therefore believes that the derogations should be subject to review by the Commission on a case-by case basis on the advice of the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER).
The timing of any risk or impact assessments should be consistent with the increasing demand for chemicals risk assessment under REACH.
Summary of the Commission's proposal 2.1 The Commission bases its proposal on an OECD hazard assessment completed in November 2002 and on a UK risk evaluation report finalised in July 2005.
These products (%quot%telomers%quot%) are not the subject of this proposal. 3.5 According to an OECD estimate in 2004, later quoted by SCHER, total annual usage of PFOS-related substances in the EU in 2000 was approximately 500 tonnes, of which 98 % was used to treat fabrics, paper or coatings.
Annual emissions were believed to be around 174 tonnes.
According to a 2002 mass balance for the industry, total emissions were below 45 kg per year.
Production techniques require as many as 18 imaging layers to be applied on to a fast moving film base to provide a uniform layer typically less than 0.11 mm thick.
Usage of PFOS-related substances has been reduced by at least 60 % in recent years by substitution in less critical applications and by the overall decline in film usage v.
Stocks of 3 % or 6 % concentrates are stored in central depots, for distribution and dilution on site when a fire occurs.
The recent fire in a storage depot in Buncefield, UK, for instance, has left a residue of 20 million litres of contaminated waste.
In the absence of any new evidence of concern, the EESC recommends that no time limit should be set for the removal of this derogation. 4.3 The Commission will continue to have a key role in ensuring a satisfactory outcome in each of the above sectors.
