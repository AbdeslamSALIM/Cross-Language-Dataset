The assessments referred to in recital 4 did not identify concerns which can not be mitigated by appropriate risk-management measures at Member State level.
Therefore a decision should be taken to postpone a decision on the possible inclusion of such active substances into Annex I to the Directive. (6) Following detailed discussions in the Standing Committee on Plant Health, and in accordance with the opinion of that Committee, the Commission has determined the further data required to determine whether the substances mentioned in recital 4 satisfy the requirements of Article 5 of the Directive.
Article 2 The rapporteur Member States shall inform the notifiers in relation to each active substance listed in the Annex to this Decision, of the additional studies and information identified by the Commission after consulting the Standing Committee on Plant Health as being required in order to complete their dossier such that all data requirements of Annex II and Annex III to the Directive are satisfied for a limited range of representative uses.
Article 4 This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
