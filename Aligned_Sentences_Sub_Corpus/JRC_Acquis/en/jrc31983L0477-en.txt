Article 2 For the purposes of this Directive, 'asbestos' means the following fibrous silicates: - Actinolite, CAS No 77536-66-4 (*) (1), - Asbestos gruenerite (amosite) CAS No 12172-73-5 (*) (1), - Anthophyllite, CAS No 77536-67-5 (*) (1), - Chrysotile, CAS No 12001-29-5 (1), - Crocidolite, CAS No 12001-28-4 (1), - Tremolite, CAS No 77536-68-6 (*) (1).
If the assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shows that the concentration of asbestos fibres in the air at the place of work in the absence of any individual protective equipment is, at the option of the Member States, at a level as measured or calculated in relation to an eight-hour reference period, - lower than 0,25 fibre per cm3 and/or - lower than a cumulative dose of 15,00 fibre-days per cm3 over three months, Articles 4, 7, 13, 14 (2), 15 and 16 shall not apply. 4.
The waste referred to in the preceding paragraph shall then be dealt with in accordance with Council Directive 78/319/EEC of 20 March 1978 on toxic and dangerous waste (1).
The duration of the various sampling processes shall be determined also on the basis of point 6 of Annex I.
The plan must in particular specify that: - as far as is reasonably practicable, asbestos and/or asbestos-containing products are removed before demolition techniques are applied, - the personal protective equipment referred to in Article 11 (1) (a) is provided, where necessary.
Annex II gives practical recommendations to which the Member States may refer for the clinical surveillance of workers; these recommendations shall be adapted to technical progress in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 10 of Directive 80/1107/EEC.
Article 16 Subject to Article 3 (3) the following measures shall be taken: 1.
Article 19 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
ANNEX I Reference method referred to in Article 7 (1) for the measurement of asbestos in air at the place of work 1.
Membrane filters (mixed esters of cellulose or cellulose nitrate) of pore size 0,8 to 1,2 micrometres with printed squares and a diameter of 25 mm shall be used. 3.
An open-faced filter holder fitted with a cylindrical cowl extending between 33 and 44 mm in front of the filter exposing a circular area of at least 20 mm in diameter shall be used.
The flow rate shall be maintained within ± 10 % of the initial rate during the sampling period. 5.
The optimal fibre-loading on filters shall be within the range 100 to 400 fibres/mm2. 7.
The phase-contrast centring adjustment shall be independent of the condenser centring mechanism, - a 40 times bar-focal positive phase-contrast achromatic objective with a numerical aperture of 0,65 to 0,70 and phase ring absorption within the range 65 to 85 %, - 12,5 times compensating eyepieces; at least one eyepiece must permit the insertion of a graticule and be of the focusing type, - a Walton-Beckett circular eyepiece graticule with an apparent diameter in the object plane of 100 micrometres ± 2 micrometres, when using the specified objective and eyepiece, checked against a stage micrometer. 9.
Concentration in air = (number per graticule area × exposed area of filter) / (graticule area × volume of air collected).
ANNEX II Practical recommendations for the clinical assessment of workers, as referred to in Article 15 (1) 1.
Current knowledge indicates that exposure to free asbestos fibres can give rise to the following diseases: - asbestosis, - mesothelioma, - bronchial carcinoma, - gastro-intestinal carcinoma. 2.
The doctor and/or authority responsible for the medical surveillance of workers exposed to asbestos must be familiar with the exposure conditions or circumstances of each worker. 3.
