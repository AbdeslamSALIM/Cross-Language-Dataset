Final Report of the Hearing Officer in Case COMP/38.281/B.2 — Raw Tobacco Italy (pursuant to Articles 15 16 of Commission Decision 2001/462/EC, ECSC of 23 May 2001 on the terms of reference of Hearing Officers in certain competition proceedings — OJ L 162, 19.6.2001, p. 21 ) Final Report of the Hearing Officer in Case COMP/38.281/B.2 — Raw Tobacco Italy (pursuant to Articles 15 %amp% 16 of Commission Decision 2001/462/EC, ECSC of 23 May 2001 on the terms of reference of Hearing Officers in certain competition proceedings — OJ L 162, 19.6.2001, p. 21) (2006/C 303/14) The draft Decision in the above-mentioned case gives rise to the following observations: The present case presents a particular feature, since it was started following a communication by DG AGRI to DG COMP of a copy of an Inter-professional Agreement concluded between Associazione Professionale Transformatori Tabacchi Italiani (APTI) and Unione Italiana Tabacco (UNITAB) in 2001 and information from the Court of Auditors.
Information was subsequently provided by Deltafina S.p.A, and then Dimon Italia (known today as Mindo) and Transcatab pursuant to the 2002 Leniency Notice.
On 18 and 19 April 2002, investigations were carried out by the Commission at the premises of Dimon, Transcatab, Trestina Azienda Tabacchi and Romana Tabacchi.
Written Procedure and Access to File On 26 February 2004, a Statement of Objections was sent to APTI and UNITAB, the associations, and to Deltafina, Dimon, Transcatab, Trestina, Romana, and Boselli S.A.L.T.O S.r.l, the raw tobacco processors, and also to the parent companies of the Italian processors, Dimon Inc., Standard Commercial Corp.
These facts and their legal consequences were addressed in a supplementary Statement of Objections to all addressees on 22 December 2004 (%quot%the Addendum%quot%), which took the view that Deltafina had not fulfilled its obligations with the consequence that its provisional immunity should be withdrawn.
Six of the addressees replied to the Addendum, and four of those requested an oral hearing pursuant to Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 773/2004.
This hearing took place on 1st March 2005 and was attended by Deltafina, Universal Corporation, Mindo and Transcatab.
With respect to the right to be heard, and in particular the question whether the draft Decision deals only with objections in respect of which the parties have been afforded the opportunity of making known their views (Art. 15 of the Mandate of the Hearing Officers), a number of objections contained in the Statement of Objections are not sustained in the draft Decision, because the evidence submitted by the undertakings and by the associations has been taken into account.
As a result, the draft Decision proposes: - To close the proceedings against Boselli and Trestina. - To reduce the duration of the infringements, as evidence for the years 1993 and 1994 was found not to be conclusive. - To limit APTI's liability to decisions adopted in the context of the negotiations of Inter-professional Agreements with UNITAB, as it could not be established that APTI had subscribed to the overall plan of the processors and address its behaviour, like UNITAB behaviour, as a (single and continuous) infringement consisting of decisions of an association of undertakings contrary to Article 81(1). - To take into account in the determination of the fines the evidence submitted both by APTI and UNITAB confirming that they had acted within the framework of Italian Law 88/88 of 16 March 1988, which regulates Inter-professional Agreements, cultivation contracts and sales of agricultural products and provides, inter alia, that Inter-professional Agreements must determine the minimum price to apply in individual contracts.
