2006/176/EC: Commission Decision of 7 June 2005 on Alitalia's industrial restructuring plan (notified under document number C(2005) 1651) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 7 June 2005 on Alitalia's industrial restructuring plan (notified under document number C(2005) 1651) (Only the Italian version is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/176/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above [1], and having regard to their comments, Whereas: I.
PROCEDURE (1) On 15 October 2004 Italy notified the Commission of Alitalia's industrial restructuring plan, in particular the planned recapitalisation of the company and the investment which the State holding company Fintecna SpA intended to make in its groundhandling services.
Following the Commission's request of 21 October for additional information, Italy transmitted information to the Commission by letters of 21, 23 and 29 December 2004 and at meetings held on 27 October, 26 November and 14 December 2004. (2) By letter of 20 January 2005 (SG (2005) D/200261), the Commission informed Italy of its decision to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 88(2) of the Treaty against these measures. (3) The Commission initiated the procedure by decision of 19 January 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the %quot%decision to initiate the procedure%quot%), which was published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2] on 19 February 2005.
The Commission called on interested parties to submit their comments on the measures in question within one month of the date of publication, that is to say by 19 March 2005. (4) The Commission received comments from interested parties on 17, 18 and 22 March 2005 [3], all of whom confirmed that their comments did not contain any confidential material.
In order to ensure the greatest possible transparency of the procedure, the Commission decided to take account also of comments received from interested parties after the deadline and transmit them, on 30 March 2005, to the Italian authorities together with the comments received from interested parties within the deadline.
Further information, including that requested by the Commission on 20 April, was supplied by letters of 22 and 28 April, 31 May and 1 and 6 June 2005.
BACKGROUND II.1.
Alitalia's financial position in recent years (6) Alitalia, 62,3 % of which is currently controlled by the Italian State, has seen its financial situation worsen considerably since 2003.
Its balance sheet for 2003 showed further losses (before tax and financial and exceptional charges) totalling €379,5 million compared with a loss of €118,5 million in 2002.
According to the report by Alitalia's directors on the state of the company's accounts at 30 June 2004, the loan was intended to cover the company's financial needs until March 2005. (7) The Italian authorities have given several undertakings in the framework of the Commission's decision of 20 July 2004, in particular: a) Alitalia assured the Commission that none of the routes opened from the 2004 summer season involved an increase in capacity as compared with the investments already agreed on 31 December 2002, and that all these routes were economic; it also confirmed that it did not currently practise predatory pricing on these new routes, nor would it do so in the future; the Italian authorities provided the Commission, in the framework of its analysis of the recapitalisation plan, with information showing that these undertakings were being honoured; b) the Italian authorities also gave a written undertaking on 13 July 2004 that the State's share of Alitalia's stock would be a minority one within twelve months of the implementation of the rescue aid, that is to say before 8 October 2005.
The restructuring measures notified (8) On 20 September 2004 Alitalia's board of directors adopted a new plan (%quot%Industrial Plan 2005-2008%quot%) to address the company's serious economic difficulties.
The plan includes shedding 3679 staff in Italy, using schemes provided for this purpose such as the %quot%Cassa Integrazione%quot% which has been extended to cover the aviation industry in order to limit the social repercussions of such measures. (9) Alitalia's restructuring involves two recapitalisations: a) for AZ Fly with support from the State and from private investors contributing some €1,2 billion in early 2005 following approval of the accounts for 2004 at the shareholders' annual general meeting planned for 27 and 28 June 2005; b) for AZ Servizi, which is to be assigned Alitalia's maintenance, groundhandling, information technology and shared services activities, involving approximately €220 million between 2005 and 2007 from the State-owned holding company Fintecna, before the proposed transfer of Alitalia's activities to private partners, possibly in separate sectors.
The recapitalisation of AZ Servizi (11) The two parties, Alitalia and Fintecna, have signed two letters of intent and have agreed, with the aid of their respective consultants, on a scheme which will yield a profit of approximately 25 % on the funds invested by Fintecna up to 2008; however, certain aspects of the operation still have to be negotiated between the parties.
Since Alitalia already received restructuring aid authorised in 1997, confirmed in 2001 and paid between 1996 and 2001, it cannot, according to the %quot%one time, last time%quot% principle, receive further aid. (13) With regard to the €1,2 billion recapitalisation of AZ Fly, the Commission therefore wished to receive definitive guarantees that the private sector was also actually involved and that the undertaking to privatise the company which Italy had given in July 2004 was being honoured. (14) With regard to the takeover of AZ Servizi by the State holding company Fintecna, the Commission wished to ascertain, with the aid of independent experts, that the operation would be profitable once the implementation details had been finalised, including as regards the future contractual relationship between the two companies and taking account of the existence of preference shares. (15) The Commission therefore decided to initiate the formal investigation procedure in order to check, as soon as possible given the company's overstretched cashflow situation, whether the two recapitalisations proposed are compatible with the common market. (16) The Commission also wished to give interested parties the opportunity to comment on any aspect of Alitalia's restructuring and recapitalisation plan which they believed should be brought to its attention.
Finally, a similar undertaking was given by the Italian authorities for the present recapitalisation when the rescue aid was authorised in July 2004. (17) In its decision to initiate the procedure, the Commission stated that, to the extent that the recapitalisation and the advantages granted to Alitalia were considered to constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty, it doubted that this aid could be compatible with the common market under the derogations provided for in Article 87(2) and (3) of the Treaty.
Preliminary remarks on the comments from interested parties (18) The Commission notes that the interested parties (a number of airlines and an association representing a number of airlines) criticise the planned financial support in part, namely the recapitalisation of AZ Fly and the takeover of AZ Servizi by Fintecna, in respect of which the investigation procedure was initiated by decision of 19 January 2005, but in particular the use by Alitalia of the rescue aid and especially the company's development with regard to the routes operated and its fares policy.
Comments submitted by the interested parties III.2.1.
Comments submitted jointly by eight European companies on 17 March 2005 (19) The eight airlines (Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Finnair, Hapag Lloyd Flug, Iberia, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines and TAP, hereinafter referred to as %quot%the eight companies%quot%) are of the opinion, as expressed in their joint letter of 17 March 2005, that the conditions for granting rescue aid have not been met, that Alitalia's restructuring plan entails new aid, and that the combination of these two facts produces significant spill-over effects.
Comments on commercial development and the rescue aid (21) The eight companies consider that the crucial point is Alitalia's use of techniques to increase its capacity and open new routes, found to be running at a loss because of Alitalia's aggressive pricing policy. (22) They take the view that the new routes could be opened to eastern Europe thanks to the theoretical closure of existing routes which are in actual fact operated by partners such as Air France and Alitalia Express and on which Alitalia can sell seats unrestrictedly and cash in on the proceeds thanks to unrestricted code-sharing agreements. (23) The eight companies argue that the opening of new routes to Skopje, Zagreb, Timisoara, Budapest, Sarajevo and Saint Petersburg in November 2004 makes no economic sense; most of these are strongly linked with %quot%ethnic%quot% traffic flows during the summer months and Alitalia has pursued the fares policy of opening these routes well beyond this phase to fill seats on its own aircraft, which has caused these routes to be loss-making. (24) The eight companies conclude that the continuous aid provided to AZ Fly maintains an unsatisfactory status quo which has the effect of delaying any decision to consolidate and definitively reduce activity and in the meantime passes the company's difficulties on to its more efficient competitors.
The eight companies conclude that the aid was not necessary in the fourth quarter of 2004 but in the first quarter of 2005 by double the amount provided for; according to them, the aid has thus become unlawful and should be re-examined in light of the new 2004 rescue and restructuring guidelines, under which a refund must be paid within not more than six (rather than twelve) months, that is to say before 15 June 2005 in this case; (c) according to the eight companies, the restructuring plan notified within six months is in any case not appropriate because, having given rise to the initiation of a procedure, it is not to be ruled out that it comprises State aid elements.
Additional letter from British Airways (BA) of 18 March 2005 III.2.2.1.
Comments on recapitalisation (28) In its letter sent to the Commission on 18 March 2005, BA draws attention to the aid previously received by Alitalia and authorised by the Commission; it argues that in the current situation the planned recapitalisations do not comply with the principle of a private investor operating in a market economy and that they constitute new, incompatible aid.
Comments on commercial development and the rescue aid (29) BA confirms its comments formulated jointly with the seven other airlines and takes the view that Alitalia has used the rescue aid to develop its activities beyond the permitted market share.
Additional letter from Austrian Airlines of 17 March 2005 (31) In a letter with additional information sent to the Commission on 17 March 2005, Austrian Airlines (OS) reiterates many of the arguments already adduced together with the seven other airlines and those put forward by BA.
With regard to Alitalia's conduct on the market and the rescue aid, OS emphasises however that Alitalia's conduct has had a particular impact on its market position as OS operates in a market which is geographically nearby and which is already greatly affected by other forms of competition, which it considers %quot%normal%quot% because they do not involve State aid, but which are nevertheless clearly felt, such as the presence of low-cost airlines and airlines based in Central Europe such as Czech Airlines. (32) OS enclosed with its letter copies of internal e-mails with the intention of showing that Alitalia operates from a position of price leader in a given market and on a certain date; OS also enclosed a number of tables for flights from Brussels comparing Alitalia and OS on some twenty routes during the period from March to May 2005.
Comments from ELFAA of 22 March 2005 (33) ELFAA (European Low Fares Airline Association), which in March 2005 comprised ten airlines (Norwegian, Transavia, Hapag-Lloyd Express, Air Berlin, Flybe, Sterling, Sky Europe, Wizzair, Sverige flyg and Ryanair), submitted its comments to the Commission by letter faxed on 22 March 2005. (34) As regards procedure, ELFAA wishes to have access to the dossier as an interested party and asks to be consulted before any final decision is taken.
Comments on commercial development and the rescue aid (36) ELFAA alleges that Alitalia has violated the conditions laid down for rescue aid by announcing its intention to expand its fleet, acquire a competing company and opening new routes.
ELFAA also mentions the airport structures of which AZ has exclusive use without the costs pertaining thereto being fully included in the costs invoiced to the company, for which it invokes public service obligations without justification under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access for Community aid carriers to intra-Community air routes [6]; in this connection, ELFAA cites the recent case of 18 routes between Sardinia and the mainland [7].
COMMENTS SUBMITTED BY ITALY (37) Like the comments received from interested parties, Italy's comments also distinguish between those relating to the aspects for which the investigation procedure was initiated (in other words the planned recapitalisation of AZ Fly and Fintecna's shareholding in AZ Servizi) on the one hand, and, on the other, the comments relating to the verification of the rescue aid authorised in 2004, for which the Commission had invited observations from interested parties and from Italy, that is to say the expansion of services and Alitalia's conduct on the market as well as the way in which the funds guaranteed by the rescue aid are used.
Italy states that it has obtained an undertaking to this effect from Deutsche Bank which also covers the current share held by the Italian State in respect of which it cannot subscribe to the recapitalisation if it is to meet the commitment of reducing its final share to below 50 % of Alitalia's capital.
According to Italy, the wider scope of this commitment compared with 2002 demonstrates the actual feasibility of the privatisation.
It argues that the contents of this letter remove all doubts as to the amount and exact conditions of the State's participation in the recapitalisation. (41) The Commission has received a copy of the letter of intent dated 19 April 2004 sent by Deutsche Bank to Alitalia whereby Deutsche Bank accepts to conclude a contract to underwrite or have underwritten the success of the recapitalisation operation for a maximum amount of €1,2 billion, up to a maximum risk of €650 million and in any event for an amount enabling the reduction of the Italian State's share in the company's stock to 49,9 %.
Deutsche Bank and AZ Fly have agreed that the price or the price range for the issue of the new shares will be determined jointly and will represent a reduction of at least […] [9] % of the quoted market price after taking account of subscription rights. (42) Italy has provided the Commission with an analysis carried out by Deutsche Bank specifying the circumstances of AZ Fly's recapitalisation in comparison with similar operations carried out on various European markets since 2003: (a) the bank explains first of all that the background to the recapitalisation is the past unfavourable results for the company whose management is currently focusing on reducing costs while also still facing a difficult competitive situation involving pressure from its competitors on the domestic market, and the sharp rise in fuel prices in recent months, which are factors that may adversely affect the company's accounts.
Attracting this demand means offering shares at a sufficiently attractive subscription price; (c) analysis of some thirty recapitalisations effected on most European stock markets since April 2003, with details provided, amounting on average to €1240 million, or 43,2 % of their previous capitalisation, shows that the difference between the subscription price and the theoretical ex right price (or TERP) [10] has on average been 22,8 % and 28,1 % for restructuring companies [11]; (d) in the case of Alitalia, the planned capital increase represents 127 % of current capitalisation (approximately €943 million); it thus represents more than 1500 days of exchange of securities on the stock market in the recent period.
The price difference in similar cases with regard to this latter criterion, for example for Heidelberg Cement, exceeded 38 %. (43) Italy points out that the […]% difference indicated above applies to all the new shares issued and that it has not received any other request from Deutsche Bank for specific conditions for the subscription of the shares to be underwritten by it; nor does an agreement of this type exist between Deutsche Bank and the Ministry of the Economy. (44) The guarantee and management fees have been fixed at […]% of the value underwritten by Deutsche Bank or the consortium; to this must be added a […]% commitment fee.
Also on this point, Italy has transmitted an analysis carried out by Deutsche Bank showing that this total fee [amounting to 5 %] [12] of the guaranteed value is in conformity with normal practice for similar operations effected since the end of 2002: (a) the bank reiterates the observations already made with regard to the sector, the tightness of Alitalia's securities market and the need to maximise demand through measures which are an incentive for banks to subscribe to the capital; (b) on the basis of some thirty recapitalisation operations effected since November 2002 on most European stock markets, which are detailed in the information supplied and which largely coincide with the first list referred to, the average fee was 3,44 %.
For operations [13] comparable to that of Alitalia in terms of the size of the market capitalisation and the number of days of stock market trading, the average was 4,96 %; (c) for instance, in the case of the €800 million capital increase of Fastweb SpA in February 2005, with a better risk profile, the fee was 5,38 %; in the case of Rhodia, a company comparable to Alitalia in terms of number of days on the stock exchange, impact on the capitalisation and difference with the TERP, it was 5,60 %. (45) In order to fully guarantee that their subscription will in fact be on private-sector conditions, the Italian authorities sent the following formal undertaking to the Commission on 22 April 2005: %quot%The Italian authorities undertake to effect the subscription of their part of the planned increase in Alitalia's capital on the same market conditions as those that will be offered to private investors, in particular with regard to the issue price and the rights connected with the new shares issued, and at a level bringing its own share in the company's capital to 49,9 % at the end of the operation.
Consequently, the break-even point will be reached by the end of 2006 and operating costs measured in CATK (unit cost per available tonne kilometre) would diminish, as envisaged in October 2004, by approximately […]% over the period covered by the plan with a slightly more favourable 2004 base; the margin, calculated as EBITDAR [18], would rise from […] % in 2005 to 14 % in 2008 (in the initial plan the envisaged values were […] and 14 % respectively).
The transfer of groundhandling activities from Alitalia to AZ Servizi, which is preliminary to the recapitalisation, had been planned for the end of April 2005 and has now been implemented [19]. (50) With regard to the use of preference shares, Italy notes that this is widely practised in Europe and it gives the example of the articles of association of Volkswagen AG and Unilever; it also points to the importance of this type of capital in companies such as Hugo Boss, Henkel and Porsche, where it accounts for 40 to 50 % of the shares and, although to a lesser extent, in certain other companies such as Abertis, BMW, MAN and RWE. (51) In the opinion of the Italian authorities, AZ Fly's shares in AZ Servizi should not be included in the calculation of the hurdle rate; the company does not take part in the increase in AZ Servizi's capital but, on the contrary, will be gradually reducing its share. (52) In response to the allegation that Alitalia will transfer debts to AZ Servizi, the Italian authorities recall that these financial liabilities, amounting to €1,7 billion, consist of convertible bonds or debts secured on the fleet; they should therefore fully remain with AZ Fly. (53) Italy has also specified the arrangements made between Fintecna and Alitalia on the future distribution of the return on the investment in AZ Servizi as provided for in the letter of intent of 13 October 2004 signed between the parties [20].
Accordingly, Fintecna and Alitalia have agreed that the share in the profits obtained by Fintecna exceeding 25 % of the internal rate of return (IRR) [21] as provided for in the industrial plan will be paid back to Alitalia at the rate of […]% of the amount above this sum.
This has led to a reduction of the discount for maintenance services from […] to […]% to AZ Fly's benefit as the maximum discount is normally obtained on the market by a company which entrusts maintenance of its fleet to a single service provider for a period of seven years.
Similarly, the […]% bonus negotiated with Fintecna for invoicing groundhandling services keeps the tariffs within the market range. (55) On 1 June 2005, following the meeting of Alitalia's board of directors of 26 May 2005, Italy also transmitted to the Commission the final contract signed between Alitalia and Fintecna which is intended to govern the way in which Fintecna takes up its participation in AZ Servizi. (56) Italy has specified that the other provision negotiated between the parties, in other words the return to AZ Fly of a part of the profit up to a maximum value of […]% of the amount invoiced, that is to say €[…] million over four years in the plan notified [22], corresponds exactly to the compensation for these values; the current business plans of AZ Fly and AZ Servizi are consistent with regard to the prices of services invoiced/paid and to future potential fares (for AZ Servizi) and returns (for AZ Fly). (57) Following the updating of the 2005-2008 industrial plan approved on 14 April 2005, Italy assured the Commission that the plan had no material impact on AZ Servizi and therefore did not affect the valorisation of the company and the yield on the investment planned by Fintecna.
The transfer was not accompanied by a payment but by the grant by IRI to the Treasury of an interest-free credit in the same amount. (60) At the recapitalisation of Alitalia, authorised by the Commission on 19 June 2002, a part was reserved for the Treasury to incorporate into the capital the last two tranches of the restructuring aid received.
Because the other shareholders were excluded from the right of option, the established value per share (€0,96) was certified, in accordance with Article 2441 of the Civil Code, by Deloitte and Touche, the auditors of Alitalia.
This value was also used to establish the final value of the transfer of 2000 from IRI to the Treasury as provided for by the decree of 27 June 2002 at an amount of approximately €788 million.
The decree also provided that the interest-free loan credit would become due at the latest on the date on which IRI's accounts for 2002 were approved. (61) Finally, a decree of 2 April 2003 established that Fintecna had taken over IRI on 1 December 2002 and had revised the conditions for the settlement of the loan/credit as it had become less urgent to do so; the date of settlement, and therefore the reimbursement by the Treasury, was thus postponed to the time of transfer of the Treasury's holding or at the latest before the approval of Fintecna's 2004 accounts, that is to say not later than 30 June 2005.
According to the Italian authorities, moreover, the comments made by the interested parties include unfounded %quot%aggressive%quot% allegations, for example the alleged existence of double aid in 1997 and 2002 and the assertion that new aircraft had been acquired, which in actual fact had already been decided in 2002. (63) Moreover, Italy considers these criticisms are self-contradictory because the parties on the one hand accuse the Italian company of using the rescue aid to enhance its capacity and on the other hand consider the aid as unnecessary because of its belated take-up.
Comments on the services offered and on Alitalia's conduct on the market IV.2.1.1.
Comments on the services offered and on capacity (64) Italy points out first of all that Alitalia had from 2000 pursued a policy of downsizing with a steady diminution of services on offer; consequently, the TKO (tonne kilometre offered) decreased from 5,7 billion in 2000 to 5,1 billion in 2001 and to 4,2 billion in 2002 with a concomitant reduction in the average daily use of aircraft (7 hours 41 minutes for a medium-haul aircraft in winter 2003-2004 compared with a market average of 8 hours 30 minutes).
This development has been in progress since winter 2004-2005 and should lead to a strong increase in the daily rate of use of aircraft in line with best practice in the sector. (65) To justify the increase of services on offer between summer 2004 and summer 2005 (Alitalia's competitors had indicated the first week of June of the two years as a model week), Italy has provided the following table for reference purposes: TKO trend summer 2005 v summer 2004 x 1 000 tonnes | | SUM04 | SUM05 | Delta | Delta % | Domestic | 521651 | 608157 | 86506 | 16,6 % | International | 981821 | 1148124 | 166303 | 16,9 % | Intercontinental | 1385817 | 1562744 | 176928 | 12,8 % | | 2889289 | 3319025 | 429737 | 14,9 % | This trend is due to the following: (a) daily flight times changed between the two periods from […] to […], with an average daily increase of […] minutes [23]; (b) on the basis of TKO in summer 2004 and the number of hours of flight ([…]), the figure is […] TKO/mn; (c) the […] additional daily minutes per aircraft for the 214 days of the season lead to […] TKO, that is to say for 184 aircraft on 31 March 2005 […] million TKO. (66) Italy points out that if the fleet as it stood at 31 March 2004 (186 aircraft) had been maintained, the capacity increase would have been even higher (+[…]% instead of 14,9 %).
This fleet and the capacity it offers correspond to that of the entire Alitalia group, including Alitalia Express. (67) Italy has also confirmed that the acquisition of the two Airbus A 319, which had been planned as an option, had been decided before 31 December 2002. (68) However, there has been a strong increase in the rate of use made of the fleet following the redesigning of the network of routes to optimise the deployment of resources, aircraft and crews, and following the reorganisation of maintenance procedures, with most of the activity taking place during the night.
Accordingly, with 186 aircraft on 31 March 2004, Alitalia had a […]% rate of use, equal to […] aircraft; with 184 aircraft on 31 March 2005, it attains a rate of […]%, equal to […] aircraft. (69) Italy concludes that it is perfectly possible for the company to significantly improve its services on offer while remaining within the boundaries of the capacity commitments given when the rescue aid was approved.
According to Alitalia, these markets have shown a growth rate to and from Italy respectively of 6,3 and 7,3 % in 2004 and 2005 for Eastern Europe, 10,5 and 11,2 % for China, and 5,9 and 7,2 % for India.
Delhi represented one of the main passenger flows from Italy without direct connection (87 passengers a day in each direction and major freight volumes); the market shows a strong growth and has counter-seasonal characteristics with peaks in winter, which is interesting from the point of view of use of capacity. (71) With regard to the abandonment of particular flight frequencies between Rome and Paris, Italy explained that this was connected with Air France's request for a rebalancing operation in the context of the joint venture agreement between the two companies; under the joint venture, the share of frequencies operated by Air France on this route rose from […]% in summer 2004 to […]% in summer 2005.
Comments on the profitability of routes (72) Italy has indicated that the opening-up of new routes is intended to enhance the company's profitability; to this end, these routes, which make use of capacities that have become available through the increased rate of use of aircraft, should present a positive gross margin, that is, marginal revenue exceeding marginal costs, even though because of the decreasing marginal profitability formula their average profitability is below that of the rest of the network.
The data supplied by Italy for the end of September and the latest forecast for 2005 all show a positive result. (73) However, at the Commission's request, following the analysis carried out by its consultants Ernst %amp% Young, which indicated negative gross margins on the new routes to Scandinavia at the end of December 2004, Italy has provided additional information.
In light of the decision to grant rescue aid, Alitalia had restricted its recourse to promotional practices compared with market practices. (78) Of 175 routes, whether direct or indirect, new or otherwise, and for a particular period, indicated by the eight companies and OS in their comments, according to the information provided by Alitalia there were 159 (91 %) on which Alitalia's fare is higher than (18 % of cases), equal to (in most cases, namely 69 %) or less than €6 lower than its competitor's fare (2 % of cases).
In 16 cases, that is to say 9 % of all routes, Alitalia's fare is less than the competitor's fare: 11 cases (6 %) concern promotions on new destinations, of which two from Saint Petersburg and eight to or from Zagreb; conversely, five cases (3 %) concern promotions on routes existing before summer 2004.
By mid April 2005, when the Italian authorities submitted their reply, they pointed out that such promotions as price leader had ended. (79) Finally, with regard to the alleged flights operated with a negative gross margin on the Malpensa-Saint Petersburg route, Italy explains that: (a) the average revenue per passenger for Alitalia is more than €[…] per segment, and not €150 per return flight as claimed by the eight companies; (b) between January and March 2005, Alitalia carried on average not 30, as claimed, but […] passengers per flight; (c) Alitalia's variable costs are €[…] per flight and per passenger, in other words lower than the figures claimed; (d) the estimated gross margin for 2005 (€[…] million or […]% of revenue, excluding feeder value) is clearly positive.
Comments on the use of the credit guaranteed through the rescue aid (80) Italy notes that the aid was fully implemented in the period envisaged by the decision to approve rescue aid, that is to say before 31 March 2005.
Italy has therefore indicated that the full repayment should theoretically be due on 31 March 2006, that is to say 12 months after the take-up of the last instalment of the loan.
However, the Italian authorities have agreed to ensure that the rescue aid is refunded within eight working days following the recapitalisation of AZ Fly and in any event before 31 December 2005. (81) The Italian authorities take the view that the expenditure criticised above (fuel, remunerations, etc.) form part of the operational costs necessary to keep the company going and are therefore strictly disbursements in accordance with the 1999 guidelines. (82) With regard to the use of the loan over time, the Italian authorities point out that the decision to approve rescue aid does not lay down any provision requiring that the aid should be used in specific periods and that the way in which its use is managed in the period covered by the Commission's authorisation does not entail any additional advantage for the beneficiary company and does not constitute a new measure.
The accounts at the end of 2003 of the major airlines show that they have held an average of 17 % of their turnover in cash and equivalents, with variations from 9 to 28 %; in Alitalia's case, it claims, 17 % is tantamount to approximately €700 million.
For instance, attention may be drawn to the following: (a) in June 2004, the leasing company GECAS agreed to deliver the B777 as planned only on condition of maintaining a guarantee bond of USD […] million initially due to Alitalia; similarly, the lease-back of four ERJ-170 aircraft was possible only on condition of raising from six to nine months the deposit paid for each aircraft; (b) between March and September 2004, several fuel suppliers (Q8, Total and Shell) required the payment of deposits and/or pre-payments for a total sum of approximately €[…] million; (c) a number of %quot%acquirers%quot%, that is institutions managing credit card transactions, especially in North America, have asked for an increase in the reserves set aside by Alitalia under the contracts in force to cover the customer risk in the event of insolvency.
Other comments (85) With regard to the comments from the interested parties that concern neither the recapitalisations nor the verification of the rescue aid, in particular BA's comments on the situation in Milan, Italy considers that these are unconnected with the procedure and are therefore inadmissible.
The company complained to the Commission about the new imposition of 18 public service obligations on routes between the Italian mainland and Sardinia, and the matter is currently being investigated by the Commission.
Finally, Alitalia has benefited from public service compensation, as provided for in the call for tenders and in Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 [27], only for the Rome- and Milan-Crotone routes; both of these routes have however been given up by Alitalia and will cease operating on 30 April 2005. (88) With regard to the financing of redundancies, Italy maintains that the extension of the social schemes to the aviation sector is a general measure of economic and social policy which makes use of instruments already used in other sectors such as the metal and mechanical industry.
The purpose of initiating the procedure was to obtain an independent assessment of the AZ Servizi recapitalisation plan and, in particular, of the profitability expected by Fintecna from taking part in the operation [29].
Also, following the comments already made by the interested parties before the initiation of the procedure and in line with its duty to monitor authorised aid, the Commission had announced its intention to verify, possibly with the assistance of an expert, that Italy was honouring the business commitments it had made on routes and prices at the time of the decision to approve rescue aid and that the loan guaranteed by this aid was being used in accordance with the rescue aid decision [30]. (91) On 4 February 2005 the Commission entrusted the task of carrying out these checks to Ernst %amp% Young Italia, the expert consultants it had already used in a number of cases involving restructuring aid given to Alitalia and who were therefore well acquainted with the dossier.
It should be borne in mind that the report does not constitute a certification of Alitalia's or AZ Servizi's accounts or forecasts, in the sense of a full audit, but represents what is generally called a %quot%fairness opinion%quot% on the information which follows provided by Alitalia, Fintecna and their respective consultants, Mediobanca and Citigroup. (92) On 20 April 2005, following the adoption on 14 April 2005 of the plan as revised by Alitalia, including the part concerning AZ Servizi, the Commission asked the expert to verify whether its earlier findings remained valid in the light of the revised plan.
Findings regarding the notified AZ Servizi operation (93) These findings relate to that part of the decision to initiate the procedure which concerns the planned takeover of AZ Servizi by Fintecna, the expected profitability of this operation for Fintecna and the nature of future business relations between AZ Fly and AZ Servizi.
It should be mentioned that unless otherwise specified all the figures quoted below have been taken from the revised version of 14 April 2005 of AZ Servizi's industrial restructuring plan for 2005-2008 and from the analyses carried out by Mediobanca and Citigroup for this purpose, which were reviewed in the expert's report of 22 April 2005.
Comments regarding the discrepancies between the initial plan of October 2004 and the revised plan of 2005 (94) The expert detailed the main points of difference between the initial plan as presented in October and its April 2005 update.
Findings regarding the calculation of profitability for Fintecna (95) In this connection, the expert checked the methodology used by Mediobanca, Alitalia's financial adviser, when calculating the IRR [34] of 25,3 % expected by Fintecna when it invested in AZ Servizi.
The expert also analysed the work done by Citigroup, the adviser chosen by Fintecna, and carried out its own sensitivity analyses, concluding that %quot%we have not found any indication that the methodology used when determining an IRR of 25,3 % for Fintecna's investment in AZ Servizi is not correct.%quot% (96) The expert re-examined in greater detail the new investment flows envisaged by Fintecna, totalling €216 million, described in point 37 of the decision to initiate the procedure, and their breakdown into preference and ordinary shares, as well as the calculation carried out by Mediobanca and described in point 38 of the decision. (97) Fintecna's investments will now be made as follows: a) in 2005, a total contribution of €130 million comprising: €98 million by subscription to ordinary shares with which Fintecna will acquire 51 % of the share capital of AZ Servizi and €32 million in preference shares [35].
Fintecna will therefore hold 58 % of the total share capital and Alitalia 42 %; b) in 2006, a capital increase of €64 million by way of preference shares; c) in 2007, a final contribution of €22 million by subscription to preference shares with which Fintecna will ultimately have acquired 69,7 % of AZ Servizi's share capital and will continue to hold 51 % of the ordinary capital.
Ultimately, Fintecna's contribution will be €216 million and AZ Servizi's total share capital €310 million. (98) The estimated return from the operation as calculated by Mediobanca is based on year 2008 flows: forecast free cash flow, less any foreseeable maintenance investments, exceptional operations (especially restructuring costs), and fiscal adjustments — that is the residual cash flow available to the shareholder — is estimated at around €35,6 million.
How this amount is shared between the two shareholders, Fintecna and AZ Fly, is largely determined by the capital structure: a) in 2008 the preference shares, held only by Fintecna, will represent 38 % of the total share capital, but benefit from a preferred dividend equal to 5 % of the total share capital, or €15,5 million in 2008.
It was made clear that the possibility of a preferred dividend had existed from the outset but can only be achieved from 2008 since there has not been a sufficient net result beforehand.
The updated value of this dividend is €151,8 million; b) the remainder of the final value, or €442,7 — €151,8 = €290,9 million, will be shared out in accordance with the total stock held by the two shareholders, that is to say 69,7 % (€202,7 million) for Fintecna, and the balance of 30,3 % (€88,2 million) will go to AZ Fly; c) the final value estimated for Fintecna is therefore €151,8 + €202,7 = €354,5 million; in relation to its investment of €216 million (€130 million in 2005, €64 million in 2006 and €22 million in 2007) and considering the amount of cash liquidity available (€29 million) at the end of the period, the IRR for Fintecna is 25,3 %. (99) The expert confirmed that the calculation method used, that is perpetual capitalisation of normalised flows, is one of the methods adopted for the matter in hand.
It also stated that the rate of cost of equity (Ke) taken into consideration, that is to say 10,2 %, is based on a no-risk rate taken from 4,25 % government bonds, a market premium of 4,50 %, a risk index (beta levered) of 0,88 derived from comparable quoted firms [37] and, finally, a premium of 2 % indicating the risk attached to the fact that AZ Servizi is not a quoted company. (100) The expert then checked the calculations made by Citigroup for the same purpose.
It concluded that they rely on the same basic data but use one of the other standard methods for assessing the final value based not on the perpetual cash flow growth of the company as a whole but on the application of market multiples calculated on the basis of the EBITDA in respect of each of AZ Servizi's activities (maintenance, groundhandling, shared services and information technology); these multiples are drawn from comparable firms operating in the same markets, at times with a 30 % reduction in view of the monopsony enjoyed by the relevant AZ activities.
Citigroup took account of four successful-outcome scenarios based on the AZ Servizi plan, ranging from full achievement of objectives as regards savings made and new turnover from third parties to only 60 % achievement of savings objectives and 85 % achievement of turnover objectives. (101) On the basis of the first scenario considered by Mediobanca, the IRR for Fintecna according to the market multiples applied is between 29 % and 38,3 %, that is higher than that of Mediobanca [38].
Only the most unfavourable scenario would result in an appreciably lower IRR of between 9,1 % and 17,1 %, which would in any event be equivalent to or higher than the cost of capital.
A final value 20 % lower than the plan (€284 million) would give an IRR of 15,8 %, while a final value 20 % higher than the plan (€426 million) would produce an IRR of 33,8 %. (104) Various risk scenarios, generating a different beta risk index and a different cost of capital (Ke), were postulated; these scenarios are summarised in the following table, which shows the final value resulting for Fintecna (excluding €29 million available cash), the internal rate of return (IRR) and the net present value (NPV) of the flows updated to the same cost of capital of each scenario.
It is to be borne in mind that the NPV updates the various disbursement flows, corresponding to the capital increases underwritten by Fintecna, and revenue flows, corresponding in this case to the estimated final value and to the portion available at the end of the period; a positive NPV indicates value created for the investor.
Scenario | Beta levered | Liquidity risk premium | Cost of capital Ke | Final value for Fintecna | IRR | NPV | Base | 0,88 | 2 % | 10,20 % | 354,5 M€ | 25,3 % | +81 M€ | Equity beta | 1 | 2 % | 10,75 % | 333 M€ | 22 % | +52 M€ | Ke + 2 % | 1,32 | 2 % | 12,20 % | 287 M€ | 16,20 % | +19 M€ | Equilibrium NPV | 1,56 | 2 % | 13,27 % | 260 M€ | 13,27 % | 0 M€ | Ke - 2 % | 0,88 | 0 % | 8,20 % | 465 M€ | 38,10 % | +182 M€ | The base scenario is that taken into consideration by Alitalia, Fintecna and their consultants.
The %quot%equity beta%quot% scenario takes account of the fact that AZ Servizi's low forecast indebtedness leads mathematically to an undervaluation of the beta coefficient; an equity beta of 1 corresponds to the beta coefficient of firms operating in the same market, without applying the reduction linked to AZ Servizi's indebtedness; this generates about half a percentage point increase in the cost of capital.
The %quot%Ke + 2 %%quot% scenario corresponds to a beta coefficient fixed at 1,32, that is the average of the highest equity beta coefficients of the sample considered, in every case disregarding the reduction associated with AZ Servizi's low level of indebtedness; this generates an increase in the cost of capital by 2 percentage points.
The %quot%equilibrium NPV%quot% scenario sets the NPV at zero, in other words the threshold of profitability of the operation; it corresponds to a cost of capital of 13,27 %, that is a beta of 1,56.
In contrast, the %quot%Ke — 2 %%quot% scenario corresponds to a 2 percentage point reduction in the cost of capital, due to the disappearance of the liquidity risk premium or a significant drop in the beta coefficient, or a combination of the two. (105) Finally, the expert carried out a full re-evaluation of AZ Servizi using a method similar to that applied by Citigroup whereby the value of the firm is regarded as the sum of the values of all its activities.
Accordingly, and taking into account the financial position in 2008, the global final value for Fintecna would be between €408 and €430 million, that is giving an IRR of around 28,2 % to 30,9 %, thus confirming Mediobanca's and Citigroup's calculations. (106) The expert concluded that the favourable discrepancy in terms of IRR compared with the same calculations carried out for the first plan of October 2004 is primarily due to the deferral of part of Fintecna's investment to 2006 instead of 2005.
Treatment of restructuring costs (108) The expert confirmed that the letter of intent provides that the restructuring costs calculated by Alitalia would continue to be borne by Alitalia if they were to exceed the provision created and transferred to AZ Servizi.
That provision amounted to €88,8 million in the initial plan and according to the detailed checks made, tallied fully with the estimated share of those costs that have to be covered in addition to the staff costs already considered in the annual liabilities for 2005.
Treatment of the objectives of the restructuring plan (109) The expert was able to confirm that the costs included in AZ Servizi's plan used for calculating the IRR were in line with the efficiency objectives laid down therein; the plan provides for a maximum annual percentage of […]% of the invoiced amounts to be repaid to AZ Fly if the objectives are attained; this corresponds to about €[…] million per year or, in the period 2005-2008, €[…] million in the revised plan.
Treatment of the capital gains from the transfer of assets or areas of activity (110) The expert confirmed that the treatment of any such capital gains, still subject to negotiation at the time of the expert's study, would have no impact on profitability for Fintecna if their partial retrocession to AZ Fly took place only after all transfers planned up to 31 December 2008, and if it concerned only that part of the IRR greater than the 25,3 % calculated by Mediobanca as Fintecna's estimated profitability.
Findings regarding use of the preference shares for Fintecna's benefit (111) The expert first pointed out the many different types of shares existing under Italian law; in particular, since the company law reform of 1 January 2004, the right to priority payment of a dividend, as in the present case, no longer imposes any particular restrictions as regards associated voting rights.
Findings regarding advance billing for services provided by AZ Servizi to AZ Fly at market conditions (114) The expert dedicated a large part of its report to a presentation of the detailed work carried out on this, describing the billing practices applied in AZ Servizi's plan; the plan had been drawn up by Alitalia with the assistance of McKinsey, which supplied it with the analysis elements direct.
The expert concluded generally that it had found no indications that the methodology used for setting prices reflecting market conditions in AZ Servizi's plan might be flawed. (115) It should be noted that Fintecna consultant Citigroup's report says that AZ Servizi's total forecast turnover of €[…] million for 2008 breaks down by activity as follows: maintenance €[…] million; groundhandling services €[…] million; information technology €[…] million; shared services (staff and call centre) €[…] million [43].
Advance billing for maintenance services (116) The price construction method is essentially based on sector price comparisons taken from the independent study carried out by Aero Strategy [44].
The annual effect of the discount rate reduction is equivalent to additional EBITDA for AZ Servizi, which would rise from €[…] million in 2005 to €[…] million in 2008.
Advance billing for groundhandling services (117) The prices shown in the plan were estimated on the basis of the price which Alitalia pays at comparable airports [45], or of offers which the company has received at those airports where AZ Servizi will be operating [46].
The annual effect of such a margin is equivalent to additional EBITDA for AZ Servizi, which would rise from €[…] million in 2005 to €[…] million in 2008.
Advance billing for information technology and shared services (118) In the absence of any other information, Alitalia estimated the prices on the basis of offers from companies interested in acquiring such companies, and reduced in the same measure the discount rate being offered by those companies.
Alitalia's Board of Directors had made the decision to acquire this aircraft on 19 June 2002, that is before 31 December 2002.
The conclusion is that, of the 25 maximum cases examined, all the actual profitability shown at end September 2004 (12 routes opened in summer 2004) or forecast in the 2005 budget for the 25 routes are already positive or, exceptionally, zero (two cases at end September 2004, one at end December 2004, one forecast for 2005); only three routes opened in summer 2004 show a negative direct gross margin at end December 2004.
These cases are detailed below. (125) The three routes with negative direct economic performance at end December 2004 are to Scandinavia:, Malpensa — Copenhagen (€[…] million at end December 2004 compared to €[…] million at end September 2004), Malpensa — Stockholm (€[…] million at end December 2004 compared to €[…] million at end September 2004) and Fiumicino — Stockholm (€[…] million at end December 2004 compared to €[…] million at end September 2004).
Finally, as indicated generally, these routes were especially penalised by Alitalia's poor performance in autumn 2004 in terms of RATK (revenue per available ton-kilometre), which fell by 14,2 % in October 2004 compared to the previous months.
However, the expert also points out that the information supplied by Alitalia indicates positive %quot%feeder values%quot% for these three routes, the feeder value being the extra margin contributed in incremental revenue by passengers on these routes to Alitalia connecting flights to other destinations, in line with the company's hub strategy.
For 2004 these feeder values are €[…], €[…] and €[…]million respectively [47]; thus, in general terms, the operation of Alitalia's new Scandinavian network should remain profitable. (126) The route with a zero direct margin forecast at end December 2004 is Fiumicino — Zurich (with €[…]million at end September 2004 and €[…]million forecast in the 2005 budget).
The route does, nevertheless, generate a positive feeder value (+ €[…] million) in 2004. (127) By the same token, the route with a zero direct margin forecast for 2005 (Malpensa — Birmingham) generates a positive feeder value of €[…]million, with a net positive impact on the company's results.
Finally, the expert concluded, from the small number of exceptions found in terms of price leadership, that on the whole there was no evidence to suggest that Alitalia had reneged on its undertaking not to apply predatory prices on the new routes. (129) The examinations relied on two sources: the documents supplied by Alitalia and checked by the expert, and the tests carried out on the expert's initiative on the Galileo computer reservation system (CRS) and on Alitalia's Internet site.
Tests carried out on Alitalia's data (130) It was possible to test each of the routes opened from the summer of 2004 onwards, either at the time of opening of the route or in March 2005; the tests involved return flight prices departing both from Italy and from the foreign city concerned.
The prices may be summarised as follows: Note: SC: surcharge cost Alitalia data (€) | AZ | Competitor | Delta (€) | SC | Delta final (€) | Prices at opening of summer 2004 routes Zurich — Fiumicino | 77 | 112 | – 35 | 10 | – 25 | Prices at opening of winter 2004-2005 routes Timisoara — Malpensa | 250 | 390 | – 140 | 12 | – 128 | Shangai — Malpensa | 513 | 533 | – 20 | 19 | – 1 | Salonicco — Fiumicino | 130 | 170 | – 40 | 19 | – 21 | Prices in March 2005 of winter 2004-2005 routes Malpensa — Zagabria | 169 | 199 | – 30 | 22 | – 8 | Timisoara — Malpensa | 129 | 149 | – 20 | 12 | – 8 | Shangai — Malpensa | 461 | 533 | – 72 | 19 | – 53 | (131) Only one of the 12 routes opened in the summer of 2004, entailing 24 tests, only one (Zurich-Fiumicino) showed an Alitalia fare (SC included) at the time of opening of the route €25 lower than that of the competitor, Swiss.
In this connection, Alitalia argued that the difference in the price was justified by the difference in the type of product, having a much lower flight frequency than its competitor of one to four. (132) By March 2005, of the 12 routes opened in summer 2004 (24 tests), none was any longer found to have Alitalia fares (SC included) lower than those of its cheapest rival.
In the case of Zurich — Fiumicino the final price currently paid by Alitalia customers is higher than Swiss's fares. (133) Of the 11 routes opened in winter 2004 (22 tests), there are three routes with Italian destinations (Timisoara and Shanghai — Malpensa, Saloniki — Fiumicino) offering an Alitalia fare (SC included) lower than competitors' prices at the time of opening of the route: a) for Timisoara — Malpensa the price difference compared with Austrian Airlines (OS) is €128.
The expert also put forward Alitalia management's explanation that Carpatair, a Romanian airline not in Galileo, offers Timisoara — Orio al Serio (Milan-Bergamo airport) one-way for €70, so that a return ticket would cost €140, more than €100 below Alitalia's fare; b) for Shanghai — Malpensa the difference is negligible (€1 for a fare of more than €500); c) for Saloniki — Fiumicino it is €21, comparing Alitalia's price (SC included) with that of Olympic Airlines, which offers €85 one-way, or €170 return.
This observation applies only to departures from Greece, since the Alitalia flight from Italy is more expensive due to the SC which adds an additional €5 to the Alitalia flight. (134) Two of the 11 routes opened in winter 2004 (22 tests), which fly to Italy (Timisoara and Shanghai — Malpensa), as well as the Malpensa-Zagreb link, show an Alitalia rate (SC included) lower than its competitor's in March 2005.
However, the competitors (Alitalia, Tarom, Malev) have had to cut their prices by some €130-150 (net of SC) due to the abovementioned presence of Carpatair, which is offering Orio al Serio at €140; b) for Shanghai — Malpensa the divergence is increased to €53 due to Alitalia's price reductions compared with Lufthansa and KLM; flights to this destination are now five times a week instead of three; c) for Malpensa — Zagreb Alitalia offers a price (SC included) €8 below that of its competitor, Croatian. (135) As regards the two routes opened in summer 2005 (Malpensa — Kraków and Sarajevo), in all four tests Alitalia's fares are higher than or equal to those charged by its competitors.
In any event, the expert observes that this price difference no longer exists. (138) The second case concerns the Timisoara — Malpensa link, for which the difference compared with Austrian Airlines at the time of opening was €128.
He points out, however, the existence since September 2004 (and confirmed in February 2005) of a return fare equivalent to €140 offered by Carpatair on the Timisoara — Orio al Serio route. (139) The last case concerns the Valencia — Fiumicino link for which, in November 2004, Alitalia had offered a promotional rate of €69, taken into account by the expert when carrying out its examination, while Alitalia had made its comparisons on the basis of a fare of €101; Alitalia thus enjoyed a tariff advantage of €22 (SC included) in the month in question; as mentioned above, this difference no longer exists. (140) Finally, at the beginning of April 2005 the expert carried out, at the Commission's request, a comparison between the prices Alitalia was offering between 17 and 22 March in Galileo (the basis of the previous tests) and those it was offering directly on its Internet site.
Findings regarding the use of loans secured by rescue aid (141) With the help of Alitalia the expert analysed the situation as regards the loan guaranteed by rescue aid, its use in 2004, its use in the first quarter of 2005 and the cash flow forecast for end 2005.
General remarks on the bridging loan and the cash assets (142) As mentioned in the rescue aid decision, the expert pointed out that the cash flow forecasts used for rescue aid were to a large extent derived from the fourth quarter 2003 and first quarter 2004 data.
This had led to the resignation of the managing director in February 2004, to his replacement and to the implementation of a new plan in September-October 2004. (143) The expert also mentioned that the €400 million loan agreement signed with Dresdner Bank AG on 11 October 2004 was in pursuance of the guarantee decree of the Ministry of Finance of 8 October 2004.
This meeting, which decided on a maximum capital increase of €1,2 billion, took place on 15 December 2004.
Dresdner Bank, on the other hand, reminded Alitalia by letter of 14 January 2005 that the loan had to be taken up by 31 March 2005. (144) Furthermore, the expert compared the cash flow situation presented for the purposes of this procedure with that published by the company monthly as required by Consob [48].
Use of the bridging loan in 2004 (145) In the fourth quarter of 2004, the cash flow net of variation in demand for working capital and net of investments (operational and investment cash flow, hereinafter referred to as %quot%cash flow%quot%), reached -€54 million compared with the -€187 million forecast in July 2004; €80 million [49] of this €133 million improvement stems from the improvement in operational management compared to financial year 2003, used for calculating the aid, and from €20 million in revenue from tax credits 1993-1994 from the State, from €20 million in payments due but not made, to airport suppliers following legal action and, finally, from €4 million received as a contribution [50] by the Atitech subsidiary for the construction of a hangar at Naples airport.
Cash flow forecast up to end 2005 (147) In the short term, the expert's Alitalia forecasts show only a slight fall in cash flow to €212 million at 31 May 2005; management improvements and lower investment, together with a fourth MD-11 sale and lease-back transaction will continue to bring benefits.
The forecasts provided by the expert and three market players (BP RiskManager, Shell Trading and Macquarie Energy) indicate a figure ranging between $54 and $58 by end 2005.
THE COMMISSION'S COMMENTS ON THE ALLEGED MISUSE OF THE RESCUE AID (149) The Commission would point out that, in accordance with its decision to initiate the procedure in January 2005, the purpose of the present decision is to assess whether or not the AZ Fly and AZ Servizi recapitalisation measures notified by Italy should be regarded as State aid.
To this end, as indicated in the rescue aid decision, the Italian authorities had given undertakings concerning the development of the company's capacity and the absence of predatory pricing on the new routes.
Comments concerning the lack of new investment and capacity (150) The Commission takes note of the conclusion of the expert appointed by it that, at the time of the expert's report in April 2005, Alitalia's fleet had not been increased by any new aircraft the acquisition of which had not been decided upon by the company before 31 December 2002.
In particular, in reply to comments by the interested parties, it would point out the decision of Alitalia's Board of Directors of 16 February 2004, as mentioned in the decision to initiate the procedure [53] only concerned the arrangements for financing aircraft the acquisition of which had been decided upon before 31 December 2002.
Accordingly, the increase of nearly 15 % reported by the Italian authorities corresponds to the order of magnitude noted by its competitors.
Comments concerning the analysis of the profitability of the new routes opened from summer 2004 (155) On the basis of the data provided by its expert, the Commission has obtained confirmation that all the routes opened since summer 2004 were profitable, in most cases in terms of their individual financial contribution alone and in all cases where the feeder value is included, that is to say the additional gross margin generated by these routes on the rest of the company's network.
Comments concerning the analysis of pricing on the new routes opened from summer 2004 (157) The Commission would point out that the existence of predatory pricing is primarily characterised by a situation in which the marginal variable income does not make it possible to cover the marginal variable cost, thus generating a loss.
This question, which was examined in paragraphs 155 and 156, requires a complex and thorough analysis of the company's accounts, which the interested parties were not in a position to make.
As already indicated, the new routes are economic and most of the routes in question are among the most profitable according to the forecasts for 2005: that is the case with Saint Petersburg-Malpensa, which has already been mentioned, Malpensa-Zagreb, with a high gross margin of […]%, and Thessaloniki-Rome with almost […]%.
Furthermore, as the analysis of the margin obtained on the new routes has indicated, this situation has not affected the Alitalia's profitability; quite the contrary since the marginal variable income from the new routes for the company is higher than their marginal variable cost, which of itself confirms the lack of predatory pricing. (160) The Commission therefore considers that, in the light of the elements in its possession at this juncture, the development noted with regard to the profitability of the new routes opened and the fares charged on them would not appear to be contrary to its rescue aid decision of July 2004.
The delay in the use of the loan also indicates that since the development of the new routes took place on the basis of constant installed capacity and with a profit margin as indicated above, did not have a detrimental effect on the company's cash-flow situation compared with its forecasts but, on the contrary, helped to improve it.
Similarly, the coverage of the future costs of the restructuring operations, essentially in terms of job-shedding, was budgeted for until 30 June 2005 and only gradually has an impact on the cash-flow situation as and when staff leave and sums due are paid. (165) Consequently, the liquid assets of the Alitalia group as at 31 March 2005 amount to €262 million, or approximately €200 million above the figure as at 30 September 2004, that is to say €60 million [55].
Alitalia's liquid assets therefore remain very stretched, whether in terms of gross figures or when compared with those of its main competitors.
The Commission also notes that, all other things being equal, that is to say taking into account the financial efforts made in recent months by Alitalia but without the rescue aid, the company would, as at 31 March be in deficit to the extent of €262-400 million or approximately €140 million, rising to €190 million at the end of May.
Thus, the economic forecasts for Spring 2005 [58] published by the Commission on 4 April 2005 were based on the assumption of an oil price of $50,9 per barrel and an €/$ exchange rate of 1,31 in 2005; on this basis, the recalculated annual charge for 2005 for fuel is approximately €625 million, representing an annual additional cost of approximately €156 million and €40 million for a single quarter. (168) Thus, even taking into account what is known about present and future circumstances, the Commission, noting the negative liquid assets in the absence of the loan, since 31 December 2004, and the contingencies relating in particular to the price of oil, still considers the amount granted as being reasonable in the light of the uncertainties at the time.
State resources (176) The Commission would refer to its analysis in point 63 of the decision to initiate the procedure with regard to the transfer of State resources to Alitalia.
Effect on intra-Community trade and competition (177) The interested parties and Italy have not disputed the Commission's assessment in point 64 of the decision to initiate the procedure with regard to the effect on trade between Member States and the effect on competition, an assessment which the Commission maintains.
In the present case, Alitalia's consultant bank, Mediobanca, has in fact noted that in the case of AZ Fly this demerger could make it possible to focus on investors interested in the aviation sector on account of its current economic problems and growth potential; it will also make it possible for the undertaking, as already indicated in the decision to initiate the procedure, to vary part of its operating costs, which had hitherto been fixed, by concluding contracts for maintenance, handling, etc., a possibility which is particularly attractive in an economic downturn.
The latter was intended exclusively, through a very short-term cash loan of a very limited amount (in particular in relation to the undertaking's short-term due dates, the usual level of liquid assets of comparable airlines, and the undertaking's balance sheet total) and moreover comprising a bank loan provided by Dresdner Bank and simply backed by a State guarantee, to overcome a short-term cash crisis which could, in itself, cause the undertaking to become insolvent.
The Commission also notes that the undertaking given by the Italian authorities that Alitalia should repay the rescue aid immediately following recapitalisation will entail the early disbursement from the undertaking's assets of the €400 million liquid assets in question.
General (185) The Treaty enshrines the principle of neutrality with regard to the system of property ownership in the Member States (Article 295 of the Treaty and 125 of the EEA Agreement) and the principle of equality between public and private undertakings.
State aid is not involved where it is a question of new capital being contributed in conditions which would be acceptable for a private investor operating under the normal conditions of a market economy [62]. (187) The conduct of the public investor should therefore be compared with the hypothetical conduct of a private investor, such as a private holding company or a private group of undertakings pursuing a structural, global or sectoral policy and attracted by prospects of longer-term profitability [63].
Application in the present case (189) The Commission takes the view, first of all, that contrary to other cases that it has criticised, it is not a question here, in the case of the separation of AZ Fly and AZ Servizi, of a dismemberment aimed at leaving the accumulated debt in a public cocoon, while the economic activity itself is transferred to the private sector.
The Commission notes, in this respect, Italy's undertaking with regard to the advance repayment of this loan within eight working days following the recapitalisation of AZ Fly, that is to say the transfer of the corresponding funds to the undertaking, and in any event before 31 December 2005. (190) With regard to the recapitalisation of AZ Fly notified by Italy, the Commission finds that private shareholders are participating in it in fact more than proportionally to the number of shares currently held by those shareholders (38 %) and under the same conditions as the State as shareholder.
The implementation of the undertaking by the Italian State to reduce its participation to 49,9 % of the company capital has resulted in Deutsche Bank agreeing, possibly in collaboration with another financial institution, to underwrite private investors to the extent of a maximum of €650 million, or approximately 54 % of the maximum proposed recapitalisation.
Their shareholding in the capital increase will therefore be a majority one, in order to reduce the public participation to below 50 %.
It is also specified in the letter of intent from Italy that the State will purchase the shares at the same value, to be determined jointly by AZ Fly and Deutsche Bank, and under the same market conditions as the private investors. (191) The successful completion of the operation is therefore guaranteed by Deutsche Bank, a technically competent professional operator, which has assessed the risk inherent in the partial non-subscription of the shares.
The letter of intent specifies that this guarantee will obviously not cover the proportion of the shares which are the subject of the Ministry for Economic and Financial Affairs' preferential option right which must be subscribed by it so as to enable it to reduce its share of the capital of AZ Fly to 49,9 %. (197) So far as concerns, first, the subscription price for the new shares, Deutsche Bank and AZ Fly have agreed that the price or price range for the issue of the new shares will be defined jointly in accordance with market practices in the light of the stock market conditions prevailing at the time of the launch of the operation.
The difference between this price and the theoretical price taking account of the subscription right will be at least […]%.
The Italian authorities have provided reference material drawn up by the bank enabling the Commission to ascertain that this difference is in accordance with market practices since 2003 for various European companies (in particular those undergoing restructuring) which have carried out recapitalisation in respect of a significant proportion of their share capital or of their value in terms of the daily stock market volume traded.
This of course is true only provided that all the shares issued are in fact subscribed at the same price by the various investors, that is to say the State, Deutsche Bank or other potential investors.
Italy has in fact confirmed to the Commission that a single price will be charged for all the subscribers involved and that no specific discount will be granted to the guarantor. (198) So far as concerns, secondly, the remuneration of the banks through commissions, the latter are based on the value of the proportion of the operation to be subscribed by the market, and amount to […]% for the commitment commission and […]% for the management and guarantee commissions, or [of the order of 5 %] of the total amount guaranteed.
Consequently, the commissions paid to the banks do not have the effect of enabling them to participate in the operation on more favourable conditions than the State or the other shareholders. (199) So far as concerns, thirdly, the State participation, the Commission would point out that the formal undertaking by the Italian authorities not to subscribe their share in Alitalia's capital increase until Deutsche Bank and any other participating banks have formally committed themselves is an essential decisive element guaranteeing the existence of a concomitant participation of public and private shareholders.
Deutsche Bank has undertaken to guarantee the participation of a majority of private investors in the recapitalisation provided for in the plan on the basis of an analysis of this plan. (202) The Commission would refer in this connection to the information already presented in the decision to initiate a procedure regarding this plan.
The measures provided for in AZ Fly's restructuring plan should result, from 2005, in an increase of […]% of TKO (tonne-kilometres offered) together with an increase of […] percentage points in the load factor and […]% in the yield.
The turnover for the quarter shows an increase of 9 %, or €77 million compared with 2004, with an increase in costs of only €36 million, or 5 %; even operating costs have fallen if fuel costs, which have risen by €45 million, are excluded; the operating loss is therefore only €120 million compared with €190 million in 2004.
The average staffing levels for the quarter (19075 members of staff) have fallen by 1617, two-thirds being ground staff, thus implementing the restructuring measures negotiated with the trade unions. (203) More generally, the plan provides for an annual improvement of around €1 billion by 2008, including €200 million as a result of the load factor and some €770 million from other aspects of the plan; among the most significant improvements brought about by the latter are arise from savings on purchases, commercial expenses and staff expenses (€~ […] million per annum in each case). (204) In terms of the outturn account, the data for 2004 and the following years are not comparable because of the spinning-off of AZ Servizi; nevertheless, after a small loss in 2005 in terms of pre-tax results and financial and exceptional factors (%quot%operating result%quot%), a margin of […]% is expected for 2008. (In 2004, for the same sectors, the margin announced on 26 May 2005 represents a loss of 10,1 %). (205) The Commission would point out that, where a particularly qualified private investor is involved alongside the State, there is no call for the Commission to take a view as to the profitability of an operation.
In the light of the undertaking given by the Italian authorities, it therefore concludes that the exercise by the shareholders of their preferential subscription right, together with the fact that the operation is underwritten by Deutsche Bank, is in accordance with banking practice in cases of recapitalisation in the Community, and can be treated as an operation by a private investor operating in a market economy, which moreover shows that the recapitalisation offers genuine market prospects.
Given all these conditions, the Commission has decided that the investment notified by the State of a maximum amount of around 46 % of €1,2 billion is tantamount to the conduct of an investor operating in a market economy and does not therefore constitute aid. (206) The Commission must nevertheless lay down the conditions attached to this decision, that is to say first of all the signature of an unconditional formal commitment by Deutsche Bank and any other financial institutions with the exception of the usual conditions concerning cases of force majeure, acts of war, terrorism and other similar cases, following due diligence checks and an agreement on the price.
The State must also undertake to subscribe the shares on the basis of the same rights and under the same conditions, at the same price and at the same rate as priority investors, without prejudice to the implementation timetable proposed by Deutsche Bank and any other guarantor banks.
The Commission also notes that Fintecna's liquid assets situation, which is favourable, as already noted in point 33 of the decision to initiate the procedure, is unconnected with any specific favourable treatment by the Treasury since, on the contrary, the loan of €788 million made by the former IRI to the State in 2000 and confirmed by Fintecna in 2003 still has to be paid back to that company in the next few months.
These operations are in fact presented transparently in Fintecna's annual accounts. (208) The Commission has reviewed the various reports presented by the parties involved in the operation, that is to say Mediobanca for Alitalia and Citigroup for Fintecna, and in particular its own experts, Ernst %amp% Young.
Calculated otherwise, the net present value (NPV) of the investment to be made by Fintecna between 2005 and 2007, taking into account the same final value for 2008, and brought in line with the capital cost, that is to say 10,2 %, would be positive to the tune of €81 million; the operation therefore to a large extent creates value for Fintecna. (209) Since such returns are highly dependent on use (€118 million of the €261 million capital brought in) of preferential shares held by Fintecna, the Commission observes, on the basis of the expert's findings, that recourse to this instrument would be subject to the limits set by Italian law.
Accordingly, with 69.7 % of the shares, Fintecna will have only 51 % of the ordinary voting rights.
The potential result normally expected by Citigroup, the investor's advisor, using this method has proved to be higher than that anticipated by Alitalia's Board used for this study [66]. (211) In its own verification of the valuation which, on the basis of the methods generally used in this connection, combines the activity-based approach and Citigroup's EBITDA multiples and an asset evaluation on the basis of fixed assets only for maintenance, the expert arrives, for the investment value notified, at a minimum value of 28,2 % above that calculated by Mediobanca. (212) The expert also carried out a sensitivity analysis which shows that the key factor is the capital cost, regarded as correct in the cases considered.
The Commission found that the abovementioned 10,2 % capital cost corresponds to a beta levered of 0,88 %, which is comparable to that of the reference quoted companies.
AZ Servizi's debt, forecast at only 16 % of its financial needs, the balance being covered by its own funds, is on the low side; the Commission therefore wished to verify the impact of a beta of 1, which corresponds to that of the reference companies themselves, without reduction to take account of AZ Servizi's low level of indebtness; the capital cost would then be 10,75 % and the NPV for Fintecna still clearly positive at €52 million. (213) If the higher beta applied to comparable companies, that is to say 1,32, is taken, without reducing it to take account of AZ Servizi's low debt, the capital cost would be 12,2 % and the final value for Fintecna, discounted to the capital cost itself, would still generate an increase in NPV of €19 million for Fintecna. (214) Finally, on the most rigorous assumption, the capital cost would need to be 13,27 % to achieve the equilibrium NPV (stress test), that is to say the point where the forecast outgoing and incoming payments cancel each other out, or in other words the limit of profitability of the investment.
This cost corresponds to an equity beta of 1,56 and a beta levered of 1,73 used for such valuations taking account of AZ Servizi's low rate of debt.
In this connection, the Commission takes note of the distribution that has now been agreed between the parties whereby a return for Fintecna in excess of the 25 % IRR envisaged in the business plan would be transferred to the extent of […]% of the part exceeding this figure.
It considers that, in its capacity as a risk capital investor, Fintecna's objective of making a profit therefore falls within a well established range: a) where the return for 2008 turns out to be lower than expected, the presence of preference dividend shares gives Fintecna a guaranteed minimum return; thus, the first €15,5 million of the net annual result will be assigned to it; b) if, on the contrary, this return is very high, with an IRR in excess of 25 %, it will in any event exceed the target which Fintecna has set itself as investor and the partial redistribution is unlikely to reduce its return to below that figure. (217) Fintecna's conduct is in this case indeed that of an informed risk capital investor seeking to limit its risk and having a precise profitability target informing its investment decision. (218) At the request of the Commission, the expert also checked whether the future contractual relations between AZ Fly, as client, and AZ Servizi, as supplier, affect the future valuation of the latter.
For 2008 these differences in margin generate a gain, in terms of EBITDA, of […] and […] € million, that is a total of some €[…] million, which amounts to a significant gain for AZ Servizi. (220) However, the Commission also notes the findings of the expert and Italy in this connection that this additional margin is cancelled out, de facto, and is even negative in terms of owing to AZ Servizi's results owing to the provision relating to the premium to be paid to AZ Fly if the plan's objectives are achieved in full.
This provision amounts to €[…] million of which €[…] million is chargeable in 2008, the year used for the valuation. (221) The logic underlying this two-fold hypothesis is as follows: if AZ Servizi achieves 100 % of its efficiency targets, as set in the plan, the valuation carried out by Fintecna will be correct and there will no longer be any need for the additional margin from 2005 to 2008, which will have to be reassigned to AZ Fly; this is the assumption made and reflected in financial terms in the plan.
Nevertheless, the Commission will lay down the conditions to which this decision shall be subject. (226) These conditions entail compliance with the following calculation parameters: the contractually agreed added value to be reassigned to AZ Fly shall not be transmitted unless all the proposed transfers have taken place, or on 31 December 2008 and according to the valuation carried out, and in either case only in respect of the part exceeding the forecast internal rate of return on Fintecna's investment, that is to say 25 %. (227) The Commission would also point out that the proposed conditions for Fintecna's investment are acceptable for an informed investor in AZ Fly since the commitment by Deutsche Bank to underwrite the successful completion of the recapitalisation of AZ Fly has been entered into in full knowledge of the general business plan of the two undertakings, AZ Fly and AZ Servizi, and in particular Fintecna's abovementioned investment conditions.
The share of the recapitalisation of Alitalia (AZ Fly) notified by the Italian State and amounting to a maximum of approximately 46 % of €1,2 billion, that is to say approximately €550 million, does not constitute State aid. 2.
In accordance with the principle of a private investor operating in a market economy, the operation described in paragraph 1 must take place in compliance with the following conditions: a) recapitalisation will not take place until a formal unconditional commitment to underwrite the successful outcome of the operation has been signed by Deutsche Bank and any other financial institutions with the exception of the usual conditions concerning cases of force majeure, acts of war, terrorism and other similar cases; b) the State's participation is authorised subject to the condition that it subscribes the new shares issued on the basis of the same rights and under the same conditions, at the same price and at the same rate as private investors, without prejudice to the proposed timetable for the underwriting by Deutsche Bank and any other guarantor banks of the successful completion; c) the operation must not be accompanied by any collateral agreement or implicit agreement whereby the Italian State would exonerate the banks from their obligation if the recapitalisation offer was insufficiently subscribed or granted the banks any special discount on the issue price.
The investment of €216 million by the public company Fintecna in the company AZ Servizi notified by the Italian State does not constitute State aid.
In accordance with the principle of a private investor operating in a market economy, based on the analysis of the viability of the business plan submitted to the Commission, the investment can be made only if the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 are complied with. 2.
The contractually agreed added value which will have to be returned to AZ Fly may be transferred to that company only for the part exceeding the forecast internal rate of return on Fintecna's investment, that is to say 25 %: a) once all the proposed transfers have been made, or, b) in any event on 31 December 2008 and in accordance with the valuation of the rate of return.
Article 4 The Italian State shall inform the Commission within two months of the date of notification of this Decision of the measures taken to comply with it.
Article 5 This Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.

Account should be taken only of the worst case scenario, which forecasts the attainment of only 60 % of the efficiency targets and 85 % of the targets for increasing turnover from third-party customers, and associated with the lowest EBITDA multiples in the range for each activity, resulting in profitability of 9,1 % corresponding more or less to AZ Servizi's capital cost, Fintecna's being estimated at around one percentage point lower.
