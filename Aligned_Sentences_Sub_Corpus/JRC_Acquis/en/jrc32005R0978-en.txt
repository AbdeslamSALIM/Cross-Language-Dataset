At present such agreements have been concluded by Council Decision 2001/870/EC [2] with the ACP States referred to in Protocol No 3 on ACP sugar [3] attached to Annex V to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, and with the Republic of India. (2) The agreements in the form of an exchange of letters concluded by Decision 2001/870/EC lay down that the refiners in question must pay a minimum purchase price equal to the guaranteed price for raw sugar, minus the adjustment aid fixed for the marketing year in question.
This minimum price must therefore be fixed by taking account of the factors applying in the 2005/2006 marketing year. (3) The quantities of special preferential sugar to be imported are calculated in accordance with Article 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 on the basis of a Community forecast supply balance.
The minimum purchase price to be paid by Community refiners for the period referred to in Article 1 shall be EUR 49,68 per 100 kg of standard-quality raw sugar.
Article 3 Regulation (EC) No 1159/2003 shall apply to the tariff quota opened by this Regulation.

It shall apply from 1 July 2005.
