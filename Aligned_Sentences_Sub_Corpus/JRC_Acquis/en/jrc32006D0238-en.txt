2006/238/EC: Commission Decision of 9 November 2005 on the measure implemented by France for Mines de potasse d%rsquo%Alsace (notified under document number C(2005) 4204) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 9 November 2005 on the measure implemented by France for Mines de potasse d’Alsace (notified under document number C(2005) 4204) (Only the French text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/238/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above [1] and having regard to their comments, Whereas: 1.
PROCEDURE (1) In 1994, the Commission approved a EUR 76 million capital injection by the French State for Entreprise minière et chimique (hereinafter EMC), to be transferred by EMC to the company Mines de potasses d’Alsace (MDPA) in the form of a capital increase.
In its decision [2], the Commission considered the measure to be compatible with the common market since it was intended to offset the extra social costs of retired workers (heating, accommodation, bridging allowance and severance grant) borne by MDPA by virtue of the special legal status of miners [3]. (2) In 1996, the Commission approved [4] for the same reasons, three capital injections each of EUR 38 million by the French State for EMC for the years 1995, 1996 and 1997, to be transferred by EMC to MDPA in the form of capital increases. (3) On 7 December 1998, the French authorities notified three more capital injections each of EUR 42 million that would be granted in 1998, 1999 and 2000 to EMC and transferred to MDPA.
According to the French authorities, these measures were designed to compensate MDPA for certain social and environmental costs incurred as a result of its closure. (4) The additional information communicated by France to the Commission on 22 January 1999 revealed that, in addition to the transfer of the aid granted by France, EMC had subscribed to capital increases for MDPA every year since 1995.
In its reply of 10 April 2000, the Commission stated that this aid was to be regarded as unlawful. (5) By letter of 10 October 2000, the Commission informed France that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the above measures.
The Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments on the aid. (6) The Commission received comments from the French authorities on 28 November 2000 and on 21 and 23 March 2001.
France sent information to the Commission by letters dated 8 February 2005 and 23 September 2005. 2.
DESCRIPTION OF THE MEASURES 2.1.
In 1967 France set up EMC [6] an industrial/commercial establishment in the public sector, and reorganised MDPA into a Société anonyme à directoire et conseil de surveillance [7], that was a wholly owned subsidiary of EMC. (8) With the deposit being almost worked out, MPDA negotiated in 1996 a social plan for gradually winding down its activity until its complete closure in 2004.
MDPA will be wound up on completion of those tasks, scheduled for the end of 2009. (12) On 1 January 2005, EMC transferred its capital holding in MDPA to the State, free of charge [8]. 2.2.
Table 1: Details of the non-notified aid granted to MDPA between 1995 and 2000 in EUR million | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | Aid approved by the Commission in its 1996 decision | 38 | 38 | 38 | | | | Aid notified 1998 to 2000 = Measure 1 | | | | 42 | 42 | 42 | Result for MDPA | – 84 | – 95 | – 128 | – 118 | – 96 | – 86 | Capital increase granted to MDPA by EMC | 0 | 84 | 98 | 128 | 117 | 79 | Measure 2 | 0 | 46 | 59 | 86 | 75 | 37 | 3.
This latter responsibility would, in any event, be incumbent on the State if MDPA had folded [9].
Consequently, assuming that measures 1 and 2 have benefited MDPA and distorted competition, the Commission concludes that such distortion ended once MDPA ceased its commercial activities and once the mines were closed down.
Article 2 This Decision is addressed to the French Republic.
