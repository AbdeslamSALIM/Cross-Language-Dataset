Case T-56/06: Action brought on 17 February 2006 — France v Commission Action brought on 17 February 2006 — France v Commission Parties Applicant: French Republic (Paris, France) (represented by: G.
de Bergues and S.
Ramet, Agents) Defendant: Commission of the European Communities Form of order sought The applicant claims that the Court should: - primarily, annul the contested decision in its entirety; - in the alternative, annul Article 5 of that decision; - order the Commission to pay the costs.
Pleas in law and main arguments By decision of 30 June 1997, adopted following a proposal from the Commission and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Directive 92/81/EEC [1], the Council authorised Member States to apply or to continue to apply the existing reduced rates of excise duty or exemptions from excise duty to certain mineral oils when used for specific purposes.
By four subsequent decisions, the Council extended this authorisation, the final authorisation period expiring on 31 December 2006.
The applicant's third plea, submitted in the alternative, is that the demand for recovery set out in Article 5 of the contested decision breaches the principles of protection of legitimate expectations, legal certainty and observance of a reasonable period.
