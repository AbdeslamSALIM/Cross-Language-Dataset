RECOMMENDATIONS â€“ AN ACTION PLAN FOR AN EFFICIENT CUSTOMS RESPONSE TO COUNTERFEITING AND PIRACY 7 3.1 Increasing Community level protection 7 3.1.1 Legislation 7 3.1.2 Improving operational performance 9 3.2 Improving the Customs-business partnership 11 3.3 Reinforcing international co-operation 12 4.
CONCLUSION 16 1.
The Communication details the growth in this traffic as evidenced by the 1000% increase in counterfeit seizures made by EU customs between 1998 and 2004.
These seizures amount to over 100 million articles annually [1] but still represent only the tip of the fake iceberg.
Twenty years ago, studies indicated that 7 out of 10 firms affected by counterfeiting were in the luxury sector.
It should be noted that the following assessment of the nature and scale of the problem constitutes the annual report by the Commission envisaged in Article 23 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003.
A seizure in 2004 showed that fake car mechanisms entered the Community from the US although the goods were in reality of Chinese origin.
The small quantities involved make the use of the simple and low cost destruction procedures now permitted under Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1383/2003 of increasing significance. 3.
At the Community level, Customs have worked since 1986 to counter IPR infringements under various legislative instruments.
The situation changed significantly with the new Community Customs legislation (Council Regulation (EC) No. 1383/2003) which entered into force on 1 July 2004.
The completion of the protection of IPR for internationally traded goods will be complemented by similar Community protection for fakes produced and remaining in the Community when the Enforcement Directive adopted in 2004 is implemented in 2006.
Target date for group meetings: End 2005.
These actions need to be further developed and brought together in a new operational control plan based on a Community approach to risk management and using Member States' expertise to spread best practices both in the Community and outside.
This would enable real time risk information to be exchanged between experts via the new Community Risk management system.[10] Target date for Risk management guide: January 2006.
Target date: Ongoing 5.
Target date: during 2006 6.
This will increase the impact of controls, and in particular help cut off distribution networks, by ensuring that when suspected consignments are stopped in one Member State specific actions (sighting, reporting, discreet surveillance or specific checks) can be taken in other Member States to counter this traffic.
Target date: During 2006 3.
The difficulties SMEs face in lodging applications for customs action in the 25 Member States contributes to this problem.
Target date: Meetings 2nd half 2005.
Basic system in place end 2006. 4.
A possibility of a central electronic mailbox monitored by an anti-counterfeiting specialist would enable these requests to be checked and, where justified, transmitted via the Community Risk Management system to anti-counterfeiting specialists in Member States and also to major ports/airports/land frontiers.
Target date: 2006. 5.
Target date: Ongoing. 6.
The signing in April 2005 of the Customs Co-operation Agreement with China (responsible for the majority of all fakes seized by EU customs) is particularly important in this respect.
Enhancement of the WTO TRIPS Agreement The growth in seizures of fakes during customs transhipments, have demonstrated for some time that there is a need to consider enhancing Article 51 of the TRIPS Agreement[13].
Target date: dependent upon WTO negotiations. 2.
Target date: 2005/2006 3.
Target date: ongoing 4.
The recent Customs Co-operation Agreement between the EC and China provides the legal framework for in-depth co-operation.
Target date: 2006. 5.
Target date: 2005/2006 6.
Target date: 2006 and beyond. 4.
The rapid implementation of the package of recommendations presented in section 3 of this Communication would greatly strengthen the anti-counterfeiting controls carried out by Customs in the Community and improve combined international efforts to combat this global threat.
