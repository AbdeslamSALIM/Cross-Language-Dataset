Prepackages of frozen or quick-frozen poultrymeat may be classified by categories of nominal weights as follows: - carcases %lt% 1 100 g: classes of 50 g (1 100 - 1 050 - 1 000 etc.), - carcases %gt% 1 100 g: classes of 100 g (1 100 - 1 200 - 1 300 etc.), - cuts: 250 g - 500 g - 750 g - 1 000 g - 1 500 g - 2 000 g - 2 500 g - 3 000 g - 5 000 g. 4.
Prepackages referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made up in such a way that they satisfy the following requirements: - the actual contents shall not be less, on average, than the nominal weight, - the proportion of prepackages having a negative error greater than the tolerable negative error laid down in paragraphs 9 and 10 shall be sufficiently small for batches of prepackages to satisfy the requirements of the tests specified in paragraph 11, - no prepackage having a negative error greater than twice the tolerable negative error given in paragraphs 9 and 10 shall be marketed.
The definitions of nominal weight, actual content and negative error laid down in Annex I to Directive 76/211/EEC shall apply to this Regulation. 5.
The checking of prepackages shall be carried out by sampling and shall be in two parts: - a check covering the actual content of each prepackage in the sample, - a check on the average actual contents of the prepackages in the sample.
A batch of prepackages shall be considered acceptable if the results of both these checks satisfy the acceptance criteria referred to in paragraphs 11 and 12. 7.
The batch size shall be limited to the quantities laid down below: - when prepackages are checked at the end of the packing line, the number in each batch shall be equal to the maximum hourly output of the packing line, without any restriction as to batch size; - in other cases the batch size shall be limited to 10 000. 8.
A sample consisting of the following numbers of prepackages shall be drawn at random from each batch to be inspected: Batch size Sample size 100 to 500 30 501 to 3 200 50 %gt% 3 201 80 For batches of fewer than 100 prepackages, the non-destructive test, within the meaning of Annex II to Directive 76/211/EEC, where carried out, shall be 100 %. 9.
In the case of prepackaged individual carcases, the following tolerable negative errors are permitted: (in g) Nominal weight Tolerable negative error less than 1 100 25 1 100 and more 50 10.
In the case of prepackaged poultry cuts, the following tolerable negative errors apply: Nominal weight (in g) Tolerable negative error (in g) (in %) 250 9 500 15 750 15 1 000 1,5 1 500 1,5 2 000 1,5 2 500 1,5 3 000 1,5 5 000 1,5 11.
The batch of prepackages checked shall be considered acceptable or rejected, if the number of defective units found in the sample is less than or equal to the acceptance criterion or equal to or greater than the criterion for rejection shown below: Number in sample Number of defective units Acceptance criterion Rejection criterion 30 2 3 50 3 4 80 5 6 12.
Mention of the age at slaughter or length of fattening period shall be permitted only when use is made of one of the terms referred to in paragraph 1 and for an age of not less than that indicated in Annex IV (b), (c) or (d).

Article 14 The names of the products and other terms provided for in this Regulation shall be indicated at least in the language or languages of the Member State in which retailing or any other use takes place.
