At its 422nd plenary session, held on 14 and 15 December 2005 (meeting of 15 December), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 98 votes to one, with five abstentions. 1.
Introduction 1.1 The new food-hygiene legislation [1], which came into force on 20 May 2004, seeks to ensure a high level of consumer-protection as regards the safety of food products by pursuing an integrated approach covering the whole of the food chain ("from farm gate to plate").
This is to be ensured by means of the observance of fundamental, specific hygiene standards and the application of the principles of risk analysis systems (HACCP [2]). 1.3 The new food hygiene legislation comprises several regulations: - Regulation (EC) 178/2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law (the "basic Regulation"), - Regulation (EC) 852/2004 on food hygiene, - Regulation (EC) 853/2004 setting out specific food hygiene rules in respect of food products of animal origin, - Regulation (EC) 854/2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption, - Regulation (EC) 882/2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, and - the Regulation on microbiological criteria (available in draft form). 1.4 In order to ensure that Regulations (EC) 852/2004 and 853/2004 are applied as uniformly as possible, the following guidance documents have been drawn up by the Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection (SANCO).
They are in the nature of recommendations and are addressed to the food businesses themselves and to the local authorities: - Guidance document on the implementation of certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004, SANCO/1513/2005 rev. 1 of 8 September 2005. - Guidance document on the implementation of certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004, SANCO/1514/2005 (rev. 1) of 8 September 2005. - Guidance document on the facilitation of the implementation of the HACCP principles in food businesses, SANCO/1955/2005 of 30 August 2005. 1.5 As part of the EU legislative procedure, the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) inter alia issued opinions [3] on 28/ 29 March 2001 on Regulations 852/2004, 853/2004 and 854/2004, which were adopted in 2004.
Furthermore, the alignment at EU level of food law concepts, principles and procedures, which hitherto were still, to a large extent, marked by a national approach, should ensure a high level of consumer protection. 2.2 Regulation (EC) 852/2004 on food hygiene gives concrete expression to the objectives of Regulation 178/2002 and sets out basic rules governing the hygienic production of all food products.
A draft separate Regulation on microbiological criteria for food products, on the basis of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) 852/2004, already exists, however. 2.6 In view of the fact that food products of animal origin may give rise to a number of special risks, two specific regulations have been introduced covering these products, namely: - Regulation (EC) 853/2004 setting out specific food hygiene rules in respect of food products of animal origin; and - Regulation (EC) 854/2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption. 2.7 Food businesses working with food products of animal origin must: - obtain approval.
The procedures for the approval of businesses will be laid down by the national authorities on the basis of Article 31 of Regulation 882/2004; - comply with specific hygiene rules laid down in the annexes to Regulation 853/2004 covering inter alia, the transport of animals, slaughtering procedures, the cutting-up and processing of meat (red meat, poultry and game meat), the production of raw milk and processing of milk etc., as well as eggs, egg products, fish and fisheries products, mussels and other sea food; - small food businesses handling products of animal origin must also obtain approval.
In point 4.2 of its guidance document SANCO 1514/2005 rev. 1 the Commission makes it clear that the approval requirements should not place any additional burdens on businesses. 2.8 Products and procedures not covered by Regulation 853/2004.
Point 3.4 of SANCO guidance document 1513/2005 rev. 1 of 8 September 2005 specifically calls on the Member States to allow direct marketers, who are excluded from the scope of Regulations 852/2004 and 853/2004, to engage in cross-border trade in border areas.
SANCO guidance document 1555/2005 of 30 August 2005 puts forward guidelines for adapting the HACCP concepts to different types of enterprise.
As, in future, there will only be EU-authorised enterprises, artisanal meat-processing enterprises will also have to comply with the strict temperature requirements (2Â°C) set out in the new Regulation [6].
