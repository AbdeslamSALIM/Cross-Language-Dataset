summary This is the sixth report to the European Parliament and the Council covering activities financed by the three pre-accession instruments, Phare, ISPA and SAPARD in 2005.
The Report focuses on the coordination between these instruments in accordance with Article 13 of the ‘Council Regulation on the co-ordination of pre-accession assistance’ (EC) No 1266/99 [1] (in the following "Coordination Regulation").
For financial figures on the pre-accession instruments, see section 5 “Financial Overview”.
A ‘General Assistance Document’ covering all instruments was presented in May 2006 to the Phare Management Committee, the body assisting the Commission in co-ordinating the instruments.
For Phare and ISPA, this process was governed in 2005 by the Decentralised Implementation System (DIS), except for Croatia.
Croatia submitted a request to the Commission for accreditation of its DIS system for Phare and ISPA in the second quarter of 2005.
Based on this assessment, the Commission decided in February 2006 to confer the management of Phare [4] and ISPA on a partially decentralised basis to the designated Croatian body in the Ministry of Finance.
Whilst Phare and ISPA continued to be implemented through the DIS in 2005 in Bulgaria and Romania, further progress to move to EDIS on the basis of the Co-ordination Regulation was noted in these countries, with the target set for EDIS accreditation being Summer 2006.
Stages 1 to 3 are the responsibility of the Candidate countries and contain a Gap assessment, a Gap Plugging and a Compliance assessment of the management and control systems.
In Bulgaria and Romania, whilst the responsibility for monitoring was decentralised in 2001, the IE function remained centralised.
As a preparation for decentralising the IE function, both countries started in 2005 to draft their Action Plans on decentralised monitoring and interim evaluation.
In 2005, DG Enlargement centralised IE function generated 27 individual country, sectoral, ad-hoc or thematic reports on Phare support to Bulgaria and Romania.
Co-ordination 4.1.
The cooperation and co-financing of projects with the EIB and other IFIs, in particular the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("EBRD"), the World Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank ("CEB"; in cooperation with the German Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau "KfW"), is organized under the amended Memorandum of Understanding between the European Commission and participating IFIs for the enlargement countries of 20 May 2003.

This programme is only implemented with the EIB in border regions and is still in the process of implementation. 5.
