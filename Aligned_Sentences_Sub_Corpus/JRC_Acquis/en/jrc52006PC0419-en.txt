Given that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification , the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. 4.
The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Decision 2000/24/EC of 22 December 1999 granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for projects outside the Community (Central and Eastern Europe, Mediterranean countries, Latin America and Asia and the Republic of South Africa)[3].
In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Decision should be codified. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 1 (2) The European Council meeting in Madrid on 15 and 16 December 1995 confirmed the importance of the European Investment Bank, hereinafter referred to as ‘the EIB’, as an instrument of cooperation between the Community and Latin America and called on the EIB to intensify its activities in the region.
These projects should be of interest to both the Community and the countries concerned. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 2 (3) The European Council meeting in Florence on 21 and 22 June 1996 welcomed the results of the Asia-Europe summit, which marked a turning-point in relations between the two continents. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 3 (4) The European Council meeting in Amsterdam on 16 and 17 June 1997 welcomed the conclusions adopted at the Second Euro-Mediterranean Conference, which was held at Valletta, Malta, on 15 and 16 April 1997 and reaffirmed the principles and objectives agreed at Barcelona in 1995. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 4 (5) The European Council meeting in Luxembourg on 12 and 13 December 1997 launched the enlargement process with the Central and Eastern European countries and Cyprus. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 5 (6) The European Council meeting in Cardiff on 15 and 16 June 1998 welcomed the efforts which the Republic of South Africa was making to modernise its economy and integrate it into the world trading system. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 6 (7) The EIB is completing the current loan programmes for Central and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean region, Asia and Latin America and the Republic of South Africa pursuant to Council Decision 97/256/EC[9], as well as the lending that is governed by the Protocol on Financial Cooperation with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, according to Council Decision 98/348/EC[10]. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 7 (8) The Council has invited the EIB to start operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
These operations may be continued, subject to a positive report being drawn up as stipulated in Council Decision 98/729/EC[11]. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 8 (9) Although Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have been included in the Central and Eastern Europe region since the adoption of Decision 97/256/EC, the EIB's total lending effort to applicant countries within this region should increase given the importance of the pre-accession facility the EIB plans to create for EIB lending for projects in these countries without a guarantee from the Community budget or Member States. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 9 (10) In these circumstances, the EIB should ensure that its guaranteed lending within the Central and Eastern Europe mandate will finance particularly projects in those countries which have fewer projects suitable for financing from the pre-accession facility or projects in non-applicant countries. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 10 (11) The Cooperation Agreements between the European Community and Nepal, between the European Community and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and between the European Community and Yemen entered into force on 1 June 1996, 1 December 1997 and on 1 July 1998 respectively.
The Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and South Korea was signed on 28 October 1996.
Nepal, Yemen, Laos and South Korea should become beneficiaries of EIB funding under the EIB's mandate for Asia and Latin America. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 11 (12) It is appropriate to make certain improvements in the programmes of operations in respect of duration and country coverage.
It is appropriate to adjust the blanket guarantee rate and the portion of lending for which the EIB is invited to cover the commercial risk from non-sovereign guarantees. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 12 (13) The Council is calling on the EIB to continue its operations in support of investment projects carried out in those countries by offering it the guarantee provided for in this Decision. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 13 (14) In June 1996, the Commission, in agreement with the EIB, presented to the Council a proposal for a new guarantee system for EIB lending to third countries. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 14 (adapted) and 2005/47/EC Recital 5 (adapted) (15) On 2 December 1996 the Council approved conclusions on new guarantee arrangements for EIB lending to third countries, according to which the approach of a global guarantee, without distinguishing between the regions and projects, is approved and a risk-sharing scheme accepted.
Thus the transparency of the EIB lending under this Decision should be substantially enhanced. ê 2005/47/EC Recital 8 (21) Close cooperation between the EIB and the Commission should ensure consistency and synergy with the European Union's geographical cooperation programmes and ensure that the EIB loan operations complement and strengthen the European Union's policies for those regions. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 19 (22) As from the date on which this Decision takes effect, the Community guarantee covering the special earthquake facility for Turkey under Council Decision 1999/786/EC[15] shall take the form of an extension of the global guarantee under this Decision. ê 2000/24/EC Recital 20 (23) The EIB and the Commission will adopt the procedures for granting the said guarantee, ê 2000/24/EC è1 2005/47/EC Art. 1 pt. 1(a)(i) è2 2005/47/EC Art. 1 pt. 1(a)(ii) HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: Article 1 1. è1 The Community shall grant the European Investment Bank (EIB) a global guarantee in respect of all payments not received by it but due in respect of credits opened, in accordance with its usual criteria, and in support of the Community’s relevant external policy objectives, for investment projects carried out in the South-eastern Neighbours, the Mediterranean countries, Latin America and Asia and the Republic of South Africa. ç This guarantee shall be restricted to 65% of the aggregate amount of the credits opened, plus all related sums. è2 The overall ceiling of the credits opened shall be equivalent to EUR 19 460 million, broken down as follows: ç ê 2005/47/EC Art. 1 pt. 1(a)(ii) - South-eastern Neighbours: EUR 9 185 million, - Mediterranean countries: EUR 6 520 million, - Latin America and Asia: EUR 2 480 million, - Republic of South Africa: EUR 825 million, - Special action supporting the consolidation and intensification of the EC-Turkey Customs Union: EUR 450 million; and may be used by 31 January 2007 at the latest.
