Commission Regulation (EC) No%nbsp%1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No%nbsp%3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products [1], and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 8(3) thereof, Whereas: (1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3615/92 of 15 December 1992 on the determination of the quantities of agricultural products to be taken into account for the calculation of refunds payable in the case of the export of goods referred to in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80 [2], Commission Regulation (EC) No 3223/93 of 25 November 1993 on statistical information relating to the payment of export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods covered by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80 [3] and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amounts of such refunds [4], all relate to the export of certain agricultural products in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty.
It is necessary to amend all of those regulations, and in the interests of clarity, simplification and administrative efficiency it is appropriate that they be replaced by a single regulation. (2) Council Regulations (EEC) No 2771/75 [5] and (EC) Nos 1255/1999 [6], 1260/2001 [7], 1784/2003 [8] and 1785/2003 [9] on the common organisation of the markets in eggs, milk and milk products, sugar, cereals and rice provide that, to the extent required to allow the agricultural products in question to be exported in the form of certain processed goods not listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the basis of world market quotations or prices for such products, the difference between such quotations or prices and prices in the Community may be covered by an export refund.
The method for determining the amount of the export refund in each of those cases should be established. (4) To ensure correct application of the provisions of Regulations on the common organisation of markets relating to the granting of export refunds, such refunds should not be granted on goods from third countries used in the manufacture of goods which are exported after having been in free circulation in the Community. (5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 [10] laid down common rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products.
Account should be taken of this when rates of refund are fixed and assimilation rules drawn up. (7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 of 15 October 1993 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the fixing and granting of adjusted refunds in respect of cereals exported in the form of certain spirit drinks [11] provides that the rate of the export refund is to be that applicable on the day on which the cereals are placed under control for the manufacture of spirit drinks.
However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirit drinks obtained from cereals. (9) Potato starch should be assimilated to maize starch for the purposes of determining export refunds.
Exporters should be required to identify the nature of the base materials and to make certain declarations in respect of the manufacturing process where such information is necessary to determine entitlement to a refund or the appropriate refund rate to apply. (15) It is appropriate when calculating the quantities of agricultural products actually used to have regard to the dry matter content in the case of starches, and certain glucose and maltodextrin syrups. (16) Where the world trade situation, the specific requirements of certain markets or international trade agreements so require, it should be possible to differentiate the refund on certain goods according to destination. (17) Management of the amounts of refunds which may be granted during a budget year on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may result in a need to fix different rates for exports with or without advance fixing of the rate of refund on the basis of developments on Community and world markets. (18) The amount of refunds that may be granted in any budget year is limited in accordance with the international commitments entered into by the Community.
It is therefore necessary to specify which general provisions applicable to agricultural licences and certificates, currently laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products [12], should not apply in respect of refund certificates. (20) Furthermore, it is necessary to specify how certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 relating to certificates fixing the export refund in advance applied for in connection with an invitation to tender issued in an importing third country should apply to refund certificates.
In order to reduce the risk of applications for advance fixing in respect of products being lodged for speculative reasons, where an application for advance fixing is lodged on a Thursday, the application should be deemed to have been submitted on the following working day. (21) The conditions for the release of the security pertaining to certificates subject to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products [13], should be laid down.
Such exports should be free from any obligation to present a refund certificate. (24) Most exporters receive less than EUR 75000 a year in refunds.
However, in order to prevent exploitation it is necessary to limit application of this exemption to the Member State in which the exporter is established. (25) Monitoring arrangements should be established, based on the principle that the exporter should declare to the competent authorities, each time goods are exported, the quantities of products used to manufacture the exported goods.
Therefore, the competent authorities of the exporting Member State should be able, if necessary, to obtain directly from the competent authorities of the other Member States all the information which the latter authorities are able to obtain concerning the conditions of manufacture of the goods. (27) In consultation with the competent authorities of the Member State in which the goods are manufactured, operators should be permitted to make a simplified declaration of the products used, in the form of aggregated quantities of those products, provided they keep a detailed record of the products used and make it available to the said authorities. (28) It is not always possible for the exporter to know the precise quantities of agricultural products used in respect of which he can claim a refund, particularly if he is not the manufacturer.
This should be taken into account when refunds are calculated on the basis of chemical analysis. (30) Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that no refund is to be granted on products that are not of sound and fair marketable quality on the day of acceptance of the export declaration.
Measures should therefore be introduced for implementing and monitoring that requirement. (32) Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 limits the period during which basic agricultural products or goods may remain under prefinancing of the refund arrangements to the unexpired term of the export licence.
However, refund certificates issued towards the end of the budget period have a shorter validity period, which cannot, due to the international commitments of the Community, extend beyond 30 September.
This Regulation lays down rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds established pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75, Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999, Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003.

CHAPTER II EXPORT REFUNDS SECTION 1 Method of calculation Article 5 1.
Where, pursuant to Article 15(2), different refund rates are fixed for a particular basic product, a separate amount shall be calculated for each of the quantities of the basic product for which there is a different refund rate. 3.
Where goods are used in the manufacture of the goods exported, the refund rate to be used in calculating the amount applying to each of the basic products, to products derived from the processing thereof, or to products assimilated to one of those two categories in accordance with Article 3 which were used in the manufacture of the goods exported, shall be the rate applicable when the former goods are exported unprocessed.
SECTION 2 Reference quantity Article 6 In respect of goods, the quantity of each of the basic products to serve as a basis for calculating the amount of the refund, hereinafter "the reference quantity", shall be determined in accordance with Articles 7, 8 and 9, except where reference is made to Annex III or where the second paragraph of Article 51 applies.
Article 7 In the case of use of a basic product, unprocessed, or of an assimilated product, the reference quantity shall be the quantity which is actually used in the manufacture of the exported goods, account being taken of the conversion rates set out in Annex VII.
Article 8 In the case of use of a product covered by Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003, the reference quantity shall be the quantity which is actually used in the manufacture of the exported goods, adjusted to correspond to a quantity of the basic product by applying the coefficients set out in Annex V to this Regulation if one of the following applies to the product concerned: (a) the product results from the processing of a basic product or of a product assimilated to that basic product; (b) the product is assimilated to a product resulting from the processing of a basic product; (c) the product results from the processing of a product assimilated to a product resulting from the processing of a basic product.
Article 9 Subject to Article 11, in the case of use of either of the following products, the reference quantity for each of the basic products in question shall be equal to the quantity established by the competent authorities in accordance with Article 49: (a) a product, not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, which is derived from the processing of a product referred to in Articles 7 or 8 of this Regulation; (b) a product derived from the mixture or processing of several products referred to in Articles 7 or 8, or of products referred to in point (a) of this paragraph.
Article 10 For the purposes of Articles 6 to 9, the products used unprocessed in the manufacture of exported goods shall be considered as actually used.
However, in the case of regular exports of goods manufactured by a particular undertaking under clearly defined technical conditions and having constant characteristics and quality, those quantities may, by agreement with the competent authorities, be determined either from the manufacturing formula for the goods in question or from the average quantities of product used over a specified period in the manufacture of a given quantity of these goods.
Article 11 In respect of the goods listed in Annex III, the reference quantity in kilograms of basic product per 100 kg of goods shall be that shown in that Annex against each of those goods.
Where the goods in question have been manufactured partly from products for which the payment of export refund is covered by the Regulations referred to in Article 1(1) and partly from other products, the reference quantity in respect of those former products shall be determined in accordance with Articles 6 to 10.
For the purposes of determining the quantities of agricultural products actually used, paragraphs 2 and 3 shall apply. 2.
All agricultural products, used within the meaning of Article 10 and conferring a right to a refund, which disappear during the normal course of the manufacturing process in such forms as steam or smoke or by conversion into non-recoverable powder or ash, shall be eligible for that refund in respect of all of the quantities used. 3.
The quantities of agricultural products actually used incorporated in residues shall be taken into account for the granting of refunds. 4.
SECTION 3 Rates of refund Article 14 The fixing of the rate of refund, as provided for in Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and the corresponding provisions of the other Regulations referred to in Article 1(1) of this Regulation, shall be effected each month per 100 kg of basic products.
The rate of the refund shall be determined with particular reference to the following: (a) the average cost incurred by the processing industries in obtaining supplies of basic products on the Community market and the prices prevailing on the world market; (b) the level of the refund on exports of processed agricultural products covered by Annex I to the Treaty which are manufactured under similar conditions; (c) the need to ensure equal conditions of competition between industries which use Community products and those which use third country products under inward processing arrangements; (d) on the one hand, the trend in expenditure and, on the other hand, the trend in prices in the Community and on the world market; (e) compliance with the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty. 2.
A reduced rate shall be applied in respect of the export of goods falling under CN code 35051050 where a production refund is applicable to the basic product used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 [18].

Article 16 In the case of potato starch falling within CN code 11081300, the rate of the refund shall be fixed separately, in maize equivalent, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 by applying the criteria indicated in Article 15(1) of this Regulation.
The quantities of potato starch used shall be converted into equivalent quantities of maize in accordance with Article 8 of this Regulation.
In the case of D-glucitol (sorbitol) mixtures falling within CN codes 290544 and 382460, where the party concerned does not draw up the declaration referred to in Article 49 giving the information required under Article 52(1)(d) or where he does not provide satisfactory documentation in support of his declaration, the rate of refund on those mixtures shall be that for the basic product to which the lowest rate of refund applies.
Article 17 Refunds for starches falling within CN code 11081100 to 11081990 or products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 resulting from the processing of such starches shall be granted only on production of a declaration from the supplier of those products attesting that they have been directly produced from cereals, potatoes or rice, excluding all use of sub-products obtained in the production of other agricultural products or goods.
It shall be verified in accordance with Article 49.
Where the dry-extract content of potato starch assimilated to maize starch pursuant to Article 3(1) is 80 % or higher, the rate of the export refund shall be that laid down in accordance with Article 14.
Where the dry-extract content is less than 80 %, the rate of the refund shall be that laid down in accordance with Article 14 multiplied by 1/80 of the actual dry-extract percentage.
For all other starches with a dry-extract content of 87 % or more, the rate of the export refund shall be that laid down in accordance with Article 14.
Where the dry-extract content is less than 87 %, the rate of the refund shall be that laid down in accordance with Article 14 multiplied by 1/87 of the actual dry-extract percentage.
Where the dry-extract content of glucose or maltodextrin syrups falling within CN codes 17023059, 17023099, 17024090, 17029050 or 21069055 is 78 % or more, the rate of the export refund shall be that laid down in accordance with Article 14.
Where the dry-extract content of such syrups is less than 78 %, the rate of the refund shall be that laid down in accordance with Article 14, multiplied by 1/78th of the actual dry-extract percentage. 2.
For the purposes of paragraph 1, the dry-extract content of starches shall be determined using the method referred to in Annex IV to Commission Regulation (EC) No 824/2000 [19] and the dry-matter content of glucose or maltodextrin syrups shall be determined using method 2 referred to in Annex II to Commission Directive 79/796/EEC [20] or any other suitable method of analysis offering at least the same guarantees. 3.
Where the world trade situation in casein falling within CN code 350110, in caseinates falling within CN code 35019090 or in ovalbumin falling within CN codes 35021190 and 35021990 or the specific requirements of certain markets so require, the refund on those goods may be differentiated according to destination. 2.
The rate of refunds on goods falling within CN codes 19021100, 190219 and 19024010 may be differentiated according to destination. 3.
The rate of the refund shall be that applying on the day on which the goods are exported, except in the following cases: (a) an application has been made in accordance with Article 29, for the refund rate to be fixed in advance; (b) an application has been made in accordance with Article 41(2) and the refund rate has been fixed in advance on the day the application for the refund certificate was lodged. 2.
Where the system of advance fixing of the rate of the refund is applied, the rate in force on the day on which the application for advance fixing is lodged shall apply to goods exported at a later date during the period of validity of the refund certificate as provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 39(2).
Article 21 If the exported goods are referred to in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2571/97, the rate of the refund on milk products shall be that applicable to the use of reduced price dairy products, unless the exporter provides evidence that the goods do not contain reduced price dairy products.
CHAPTER III REFUND CERTIFICATES SECTION 1 General provisions Article 22 1.

Article 36 The total amount in respect of which certificates may be issued for each of the tranches referred to in Article 33 shall be: (a) 30 % of the amount calculated in accordance with Article 35, as determined on 14 September, in the case of the tranche referred to in point (a) of the first paragraph of Article 33; (b) 27 % of the amount calculated in accordance with Article 35, as determined on 14 November, in the case of the tranche referred to in point (b) of the first paragraph of Article 33; (c) 32 % of the amount calculated in accordance with Article 35, as determined on 14 January, in the case of the tranche referred to in point (c) of the first paragraph of Article 33; (d) 44 % of the amount calculated in accordance with Article 35, as determined on 14 March, in the case of the tranche referred to in point (d) of the first paragraph of Article 33; (e) 67 % of the amount calculated in accordance with Article 35, as determined on 14 May, in the case of the tranche referred to in point (e) of the first paragraph of Article 33; (f) 100 % of the amount calculated in accordance with Article 35, as determined on 14 July, in the case of the tranche referred to in point (f) of the first paragraph of Article 33.
If the total amount represented by the applications received in respect of each of the periods concerned exceeds the maximum referred to in Article 35, the Commission shall set a reduction coefficient applicable to all applications lodged before the corresponding date referred to in Article 33 so as to comply with the maximum referred to in Article 35.
The Commission shall publish the coefficient in the Official Journal of the European Union within five working days of the dates referred to in Article 34. 2.
However, in respect of the tranche referred to in point (f) of the first paragraph of Article 33, applicants may withdraw their applications within five working days from publication of the coefficient in the Official Journal of the European Union. 3.
If the total amount of the applications received in a particular application week exceeds the remaining amount available under paragraph 1 the Commission shall take one or more of the following steps: (a) set a reduction coefficient applicable to applications for refund certificates lodged in that particular application week, which have been notified to the Commission and for which refund certificates have not yet issued; (b) direct Member States to reject applications, lodged in that particular application week, which have yet to be notified to the Commission; (c) suspend the lodging of applications for refund certificates. 4.
Any regulation adopted pursuant to paragraph 3 shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union within four days from notification of the applications lodged in accordance with paragraph 2.
The refund certificates referred to in Article 40, however, shall be valid until the last day of the fifth month following the month in which the application for the certificate was made.
If refund rates are fixed in advance in accordance with Article 29, those rates shall remain valid until the last day of the fifth month following the month in which the application for advance fixing was lodged, or until the last day of the period of validity of the certificate, whichever is the earlier.
Article 40 Commission Regulation (EC) No 2298/2001 [21] shall apply to applications for refund certificates and refund certificates issued for export of goods, which are part of an international food aid operation within the meaning of Article 10(4) of the Agreement.
However, that limit may be increased to EUR 4 million if none of the reduction coefficients published since the beginning of the budget period and referred to in Article 37(1) exceeds 50 %. 3.
Where the amounts notified under paragraph 4, when added to the amounts in respect of which one or more certificates have already been applied for as part of the same invitation to tender, exceed the applicable limit referred to in paragraph 2 the Commission shall inform the Member States within two working days of the receipt of the additional information referred to in paragraph 4 that the refund certificate shall not be issued to the operator. 6.
The Commission may suspend application of paragraph 2 where the cumulative sum of the amounts of refund certificates which may be issued in accordance with Article 49 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 exceeds EUR 4 million in a budget period.
By way of exception from Article 39(1) and (2) of this Regulation refund certificates issued in accordance with Article 49 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 shall be valid with effect from the day on which they are issued within the meaning of Article 23(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000.
Refund certificates shall be valid until the end of the eighth month following the month of issue, or until 30 September, whichever is the sooner.
Rates fixed in advance are valid until the last day of the certificate’s validity. 8.
Where the competent authority has been satisfied in accordance with Article 49(9)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 that the agency that issued the invitation to tender has cancelled the contract for reasons which are not attributable to the successful tenderer and are not considered to constitute force majeure, it shall release the security in cases where the rate of the refund fixed in advance in respect of the basic product corresponding to the largest refund compared with the other basic products used is higher than or equal to the rate of the refund valid on the last day of the certificate's validity. 9.
Where the successful tenderer furnishes proof in accordance with Article 49(9)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 that the invitation to tender or the contract concluded following the award provided for a downward tolerance or option of more than 5 % and that the agency that issued the invitation to tender is invoking the relevant clause, the obligation to export shall be deemed to have been fulfilled where the quantity exported is not more than 10 % less than the quantity corresponding to the amount for which the certificate was issued.
The first subparagraph shall apply on condition that the rate of the refund fixed in advance in respect of the basic product corresponding to the largest refund compared with the other basic products used is higher than or equal to the rate of the refund valid on the last day of validity of the certificate.
In such cases the rate of 95 % referred to in Article 44(4) of this Regulation shall be replaced by 90 %. 11.
Article 42 Without prejudice to Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000, extracts valid throughout the Community may be taken from certificates registered as valid in a single Member State.
SECTION 2 Securities Article 43 Applications for refund certificates, save those in respect of food aid operations referred to in Article 40, shall be valid only if a security equal to 25 % of the amount applied for has been lodged in accordance with the conditions set out in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000.
The security shall be released in accordance with the conditions set out in Article 44 of this Regulation.
If the applicant withdraws his application for a certificate, in accordance with Article 37(2), 80 % of the original security shall be released. 3.
The security shall be released in full once the holder of the certificate has applied for refunds totalling 95 % of the amount in respect of which the certificate was issued.
On application by the titular holder, Member States may release the security by instalments in proportion to the amounts in respect of which the conditions referred to in Article 31(2) and (3) have been fulfilled, provided that evidence has been produced that an amount equal to at least 5 % of that indicated on the certificate has been applied for. 4.
Where applications have been made for refunds in respect of less than 95 % of the amount for which the certificate was issued, part of the security, equal to 25 % of the difference between 95 % of the amount for which the certificate was issued and the amount of refunds actually used, shall be forfeited.
However, if the amount in respect of which the conditions referred to in Article 31(2) and (3) have been fulfilled is less than 5 % of the amount indicated on the certificate, the whole of the security shall be forfeit.
If the total amount of the security which would be forfeited comes to EUR 100 or less for a given certificate, the Member State concerned shall release the whole of the security.
Where the certificate or an extract from the certificate is returned to the issuing authority within a period corresponding to the initial two-thirds of its term of validity, the corresponding amount of security to be forfeited shall be reduced by 40 %, for which purpose, any part of a day shall count as a whole day.
Where the certificate or extract from the certificate is returned to the issuing authority within a period corresponding to the last third of its term of validity or during the month following the expiry date, the corresponding amount of security to be forfeited shall be reduced by 25 %. 2.
CHAPTER IV EXPORTS NOT COVERED BY CERTIFICATES Article 46 For each budget period from 1 October 2004, exports not covered by a certificate shall be eligible for payment of a refund within the limit of a total reserve of EUR 40 million for each budget year.
Article 46 shall not apply to exports which are part of an international food aid operation within the meaning of Article 10(4) of the Agreement, nor to the supplies referred to in the third indent of the second subparagraph of Article 4(1) and in Articles 36(1), 40(1), 44(1) and 46(1) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999. 2.
Article 46 shall apply to exports by operators that have not held a refund certificate since the beginning of the budget period in question and do not hold such a certificate on the date of export.
The applications submitted by the operator on the terms set out in Article 32(1) during the budget year, including the submission of the application for the export in question, shall not give rise to payment of more than EUR 75000.
If the specific application is regarded by the competent authority as being the customs declaration within the meaning of Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, the date of the application may, if the competent authority agrees, be the date on which the customs authority accepted the export declaration in question. 3.
Article 46 shall apply only in the Member State in which the operator is established.
If the sum of the amounts notified by the Member States reaches EUR 30 million the Commission may, taking account of the Community’s international commitments, suspend the application of Article 46 to exports not covered by a refund certificate, for a maximum of 20 working days.
Under the same circumstances, the Commission may, in accordance with Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 3448/93, suspend the application of Article 46 of this Regulation to exports not covered by a refund certificate, for a period exceeding 20 working days.
CHAPTER V OBLIGATIONS FOR THE EXPORTER Article 49 1.
When goods are to be exported, the party concerned shall declare the quantities of basic products, of products derived from the processing thereof, or of products assimilated to one of those two categories in accordance with Article 3, which have actually been used, within the meaning of Article 10, in the manufacture of those goods, on which a refund will be requested, or otherwise refer to that composition if it has been determined in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 10. 2.
Article 50 By way of derogation from Article 49, and in consultation with the competent authorities, the declaration of the products or goods used may be replaced by an aggregated declaration of the quantities of products used or by a reference to a declaration of those quantities, if the latter have already been determined pursuant to the third paragraph of Article 10 and on condition that the manufacturer places at the disposal of the authorities all the information necessary to verify the declaration.
Article 51 Where the exporter does not draw up the declaration referred to in Article 49 or does not provide satisfactory information in support of his declaration, he shall not be entitled to a refund.
Article 49 shall not apply to the quantities of agricultural products determined in accordance with Annex III, with the exception of the following: (a) quantities of products as referred to in Article 49(1) exported in the form of goods obtained partly from products for which the payment of export refund is covered by the Regulations referred to in Article 1(1) and partly from other products, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the third paragraph of Article 11; (b) quantities of eggs or egg products exported in the form of pasta falling within CN code 19021100; (c) the quantity of dry-matter contained in fresh pasta, as referred to in the second paragraph of Article 11; (d) the nature of the basic products actually used in the manufacture of D-glucitol (sorbitol) falling within CN codes 290544 and 382460, and, where necessary, the proportions of D-glucitol (sorbitol) obtained from amylaceous products and sucrose; (e) quantities of casein exported in the form of goods falling within CN code 35019090; (f) the degree plato of beer made from malt falling within CN code 22029010; (g) the quantities of unmalted barley accepted by the competent authorities.
When goods are analysed for the purposes of Articles 49, 50, 51 or of paragraphs 1 or 3 of this Article, the methods of analysis shall be those referred to in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 4056/87 [22] or, in their absence, those applicable for the Common Customs Tariff classification of similar goods which are imported into the Community. 3.
The quantities of goods exported and the quantities of the products referred to in Article 49(1) or a reference to the composition determined in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 10 shall be entered on the document certifying exportation.
However, where the second paragraph of Article 51 applies, the latter quantities shall be replaced by the quantities of basic products listed in column 4 of Annex IV, corresponding to the results of the analysis of the goods exported. 4.
In order for a refund to be granted on goods falling within CN codes 04031051 to 04031099, 04039071 to 04039099, 04052010, 04052030, and 21050099, the goods shall meet the requirements in Directive 92/46/EEC, in particular the requirement of having been prepared in an approved establishment and of complying with the health marking requirements specified in point A of Chapter IV of Annex C thereto.
In order for a refund to be granted on goods falling within CN codes 35021190 and 35021990, the goods shall comply with the provisions laid down in Chapter XI of the Annex to Directive 89/437/EEC. 5.
For the purposes of Articles 49 and 50, each Member State shall inform the Commission of the checks carried out in its territory on the various kinds of goods exported.
Pursuant to Articles 49 and 50, for goods falling within CN codes 04052010, 04052030, 18069060 to 18069090, 1901 or 21069098 containing a high percentage of milk products falling within CN codes 04021019, 04022119, 0405 or 0406, the party concerned shall provide a declaration that none of those milk products have been imported from third countries or a specification of the quantities of those milk products imported from third countries. 2.
CHAPTER VI PAYMENT OF THE REFUND Article 54 1.
As regards exports effected with presentation of a refund certificate issued in respect of a budget period, and where the Commission considers that there is a danger that the Community does not meet its international commitments, refund payments scheduled after the end of that period shall not be made before 16 October.
In that case the time-limit referred to in Article 49(8) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 may be temporarily extended to three months and 15 days by way of a regulation to be published before 20 September in the Official Journal of the European Union. 2.
By way of derogation from Article 28(6) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, in the case of refund certificates issued for use as from 1 June in respect of goods to be exported before 1 October, the basic products as listed in Annex I to this Regulation may remain under customs control with a view to processing for three months from the date of acceptance of the payment declaration.
