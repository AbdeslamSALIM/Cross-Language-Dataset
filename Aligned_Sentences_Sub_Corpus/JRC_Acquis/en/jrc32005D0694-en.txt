The Commission addressed such an opinion on Italy to the Council on 29 June 2005.
In delivering its assessment, the Commission has taken into account the Ecofin Report to the European Council on "Improving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact", endorsed by the latter on 22 March 2005. (5) Article 104(6) of the Treaty lays down that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists.
The breach of the 3 % of GDP Treaty reference value in 2003 and 2004 did not result from an unusual event outside the control of the Italian authorities, nor was it the result of a severe economic downturn in the sense of the Stability and Growth Pact.
The rate of economic growth over the last three years was positive but low (0,4 %, 0,3 % and 1,2 %, in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively).
The output gap is estimated to have turned from 2,1 % of potential GDP in 2001 to Ã¢&#x20AC;&#x201C; 1,3 % of potential GDP in 2004.
Moreover, the present level of the primary surplus (below 2 % of GDP in 2004) does not ensure a satisfactorily declining path of the debt ratio.
This indicates that the Treaty requirement concerning the debt criterion is not fulfilled either. (9) Other relevant factors included in the Commission report in accordance to Article 104(3) of the Treaty, as well as additional ones put forward by the Italian authorities with their letter dated 6 June 2005, have been analysed by the Council.
Article 2 This Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.
