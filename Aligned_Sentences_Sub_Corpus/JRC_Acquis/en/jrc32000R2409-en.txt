Such a provision should therefore be inserted in the Articles fixing the level of aid. (3) A tolerance should be laid down for the volumes delivered for compulsory distillation under Articles 27 and 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
The provision was inserted by error in Section II of Chapter I, which refers only to one compulsory distillation measure.
It shall apply from 1 August 2000.
