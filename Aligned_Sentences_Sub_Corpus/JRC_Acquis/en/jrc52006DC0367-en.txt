Communication from the Commission - Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child {SEC(2006) 888} {SEC(2006) 889} /* COM/2006/0367 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 4.7.2006 COM(2006) 367 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION Towards an EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child {SEC(2006) 888}{SEC(2006) 889} COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION Towards an EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child I.
From the age of 5 to 12 years, children are still in need of protection but also develop other needs: the right to education is obviously essential for children to be able to develop in society.
One third of all girls are subject to coercive sexual relations, one fifth are subjected to forced marriages[13] and some 14 million girls between the ages of 15 and 19 give birth each year.
There are also children who deserve particular attention to their rights and needs: over 200 million children live with serious disabilities and 140 million children are orphans, a number that is growing due to HIV/AIDS.
The European Union can bring essential and fundamental added value in the field of children’s rights.
CONCLUSION The Commission: - will develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure that the European Union contributes to promoting and safeguarding children’s rights in all its internal and external actions and supports the efforts of the Member States in this field; - calls on the Member States, on the European institutions and on other stakeholders to take an active part in the development of this strategy and so to contribute to its success.
