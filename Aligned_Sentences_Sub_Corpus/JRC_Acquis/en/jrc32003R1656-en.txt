Most of this increase took place in the fourth quarter of 2000 and in the first half of 2001.
The findings stated in recitals 60 and 61 of the provisional Regulation can therefore be confirmed. (24) In the absence of any other comments, the facts and figures as set out in recitals 52 to 65 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.
Conclusion on injury (25) A deterioration in the situation of the Community industry during the period 2001 and the IP has been found, in particular in terms of reduced production, capacity utilisation, sales, market share, profitability, return on investment and cash flow.
In addition, significant price undercutting as well as a serious deterioration in profitability and return on investment occurred. (26) In the absence of any comments on the findings, the conclusions reached as set out in recitals 66 to 70 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.
The conclusion in the provisional Regulation can therefore be maintained. (29) In the absence of any other comments on causation, the findings and the conclusion reached as set out in recitals 71 to 85 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.
