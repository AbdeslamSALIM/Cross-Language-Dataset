PROVISIONAL UTILISATION OF APPROPRIATIONS The uptake of appropriations under heading 1 of the budget for the month of October 2004 (Member States' expenditure from 16 October 2003 to 31 August 2004) amounts to EUR 39 335.8 million, i.e. 84.1% of appropriations.
Before the clearance of the accounts, this expenditure is approximately –EUR 3 363.0 million under the indicator for both subheadings 1a and 1b.
However, when the clearance of accounts is included, this under-execution rises to –EUR 3 751.5 million for both subheadings.

COMMENTS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2004 BUDGET The budget’s implementation is influenced by the following main factors: 2.1.
The following comments are called for: Article 05 02 01: Market measures for cereals | Divergence: –EUR 208 million (–37.0%) | (expenditure: EUR 304 million) (indicator: EUR 512 million) | At this point in time, the Commission expects that this article will be under-executed by approximately –EUR 200 million by the end of the budget year.
Article 05 02 05: Sugar | Divergence: –EUR 300 million (–17.5%) | (expenditure: EUR 1 226 million) (indicator: EUR 1 526 million) | The current under-execution by comparison to the level of the indicator is due to the reduced quantities of sugar exported with refunds.
Article 05 02 08: Fruit and vegetables | Divergence: –EUR 73 million (–4.5%) | (expenditure: EUR 1 394 million) (indicator: EUR 1 467 million) | At this point in time, the Commission expects that this article’s current under-execution will continue to the end of the budget year.
Article 05 02 09: Wine | Divergence: –EUR 67 million (–5.6%) | (expenditure: EUR 1 025 million) (indicator: EUR 1 092 million) | This under-execution by comparison to the level of the indicator is due to the fact that crisis distillation was not used at all in the course of this budget year while the quantities of alcohol bought into intervention were lower than the quantities retained when the budget was established.
The Commission’s services expect that this article’s under-implementation will continue to the end of the budget year and it is expected to amount to approximately –EUR 70 million.
Article 05 02 11: Other plant products/measures | Divergence: –EUR 66 million (–8.5%) | (expenditure: EUR 610 million) (indicator: EUR 676 million) | This under-execution is due to the slowdown in the implementation of the POSEI programmes when compared to the level pointed out by the indicator.
Article 05 03 01: Milk and milk products | Divergence: –EUR 386 million (–13.1%) | (expenditure: EUR 2 349 million) (indicator: EUR 2 735 million) | The Commission services expect that there will be an under-implementation of the budget’s appropriations for this article of approximately –EUR 550 million by the end of the budget year.
Article 05 03 02: Beef and veal | Divergence: –EUR 124 million (–1.5%) | (expenditure: EUR 7 640 million) (indicator: EUR 7 764 million) | The Commission services expect that there will be an under-implementation of the budget’s appropriations for this article by the end of the budget year amounting to approximately –EUR 250 million.
Article 05 03 04: Pigmeat, eggs and poultry, beekeeping and other animal products | Divergence: EUR 3 million (1.7%) | (expenditure: EUR 146 million) (indicator: EUR 143 million) | In order to stabilise the pigmeat market, the Commission introduced the private storage of pigmeat in late December 2003 and the payment of export refunds on fresh and frozen pigmeat exports as of the end of January 2004.
However, the 2004 budget did not include appropriations for any of these schemes.
Subheading 1b Article 05 04 04: Transitional instrument for rural development in the new Member States | Divergence: –EUR 1 710 million (–98.7%) | (expenditure: EUR 23 million) (indicator: EUR 1 733 million) | This article relates to the transitional instrument for the financing of rural development by the EAGGF-Guarantee for the new Member States.
CONCLUSIONS Implementation of appropriations at 31 August 2004 The uptake of appropriations for October 2004 (Member States' expenditure from 16 October 2003 to 31 August 2004) shows an under-implementation for subheading 1a.
These savings will be primarily attributable to articles 05 02 01, 05 02 05, 05 02 08, 05 02 09, 05 03 01, 05 03 02 and 05 03 03 of the budget.
