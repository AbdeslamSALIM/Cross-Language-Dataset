THE EU MUST DO MORE THIS YEAR WILL BE A CRUCIAL ONE IF WE ARE TO ACHIEVE THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDGs): 2005 will be development year.
At its meeting on 22 and 23 March 2005, the European Council called “on the Commission and the Council to step up their work, particularly on the various development components, so as to finalise our positions on the various topics and enable the European Union to play an active part in the discussions ahead”.
Since 2000 the EU has advocated a process to bring about a review of progress, the adoption of guidelines on common security issues, agreements to improve the implementation of commitments made pursuant to the Millennium Declaration and the MDGs, and decisions on the organisational reforms needed to achieve the objectives[1].
The proposals on development financing and policy coherence are set out in detail in two other communications[6].
Together these proposals are crucial in order to contribute to the three pillars of sustainable development (economic, social and environmental). 2.
Taking account of additional ODA needs not directly related to the MDGs, the report recommends that donors commit themselves to reaching the target of 0.7% of GNI by 2015 at the latest.
These targets have to be sufficiently ambitious in order to credibly ensure that it is possible to reach 0.7% by 2015 .
In line with the Council request to set a “ new and adequate target ” this means going halfway by 2010 bridging the gap.
Member States which joined after 2002 (EU10) reach an individual baseline of (0.17)% ODA/GNI in 2010, thereby reaching the midpoint towards the “Barcelona acquis” of 0.33% in 2015.
The figure of 0.51% in 2010 represents the midpoint between the individual Member State baseline of 0.33% in 2006 and 0.7% in 2015.
If all the political and technical issues can be dealt with (on the basis of detailed assessment criteria), the Commission is ready to work to find an EU position in favour of a double strategy: increased ODA by 2010 plus innovatory financing proposals.
They will enter into force in 2008.
UN Millennium Project Report January 2005. [16] Annex 1 provides further details on each of the areas and EU commitments. [17] The Commission proposed support of up to EUR 50 million as part of the “conditional billion”. [18] The intra-ACP resources will provide an initial amount.
Until end 2007 financing is foreseen under the 9th EDF. [21] This will be done in the framework of the allocations within the new financial perspectives and notably with the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument. [22] At the Kananaskis Summit (2002) the G8 pledged to allocate at least 50% of additional ODA to Africa.
If this pledge were made at EU level and if current trends continue (keeping of Barcelona commitments for 2006), this would mean an additional allocation of more than EUR 6.5 billion a year for Africa. [23] In the context of the NEPAD African Forum for Science and Technology and in line with the Millennium Goals Project Report Promoting Innovation to Improve Lives in Developing Nations, [24] The Commission proposed a support of up to EUR 50 million in the framework of the so called “Conditional Billion”. [25] The intra-ACP resources will provide an initial amount.
