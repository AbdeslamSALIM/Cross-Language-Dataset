The Portuguese Government has decided to apply the provisions of Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92, with a view to revising the Commission notices (98/C 267/05) and (98/C 267/06) published in the OJEC of 26 August 1998 on the amendment of public service obligations imposed on scheduled air services operated on the following routes: - Lisbon/Funchal/Lisbon - Lisbon/Porto Santo/Lisbon - Porto/Funchal/Porto - Funchal/Porto Santo/Funchal 2.
This surcharge will be revised quarterly and calculated according to the following formula (rounded off to the nearest unit): SC = k × (b - 50,00) Where: SC = Additional cost of fuel on return trips between Funchal and Porto Santo and single trips on the other routes.
k = 0,684862 × average USD/Euro exchange rate for the preceding quarter B = average barrel price in USD in the preceding quarter 3.
