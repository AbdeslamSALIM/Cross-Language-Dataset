According to the Strategic objectives 2005-2009, Europe 2010: A Partnership for European Renewal - Prosperity, Solidarity and Security adopted by the Commission on 26 January 2005, the protection of fundamental rights must be put at the forefront of European action by establishing a European Agency of Fundamental Rights.
The European Parliament called on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal concerning the Agency in its Report on Promotion and protection of fundamental rights: the role of national and European institutions, including the Fundamental Rights Agency, adopted on 26 May 2005.
The contributors included ten Member States, European and international bodies, national bodies for human rights, and equal opportunities, members of academia, private citizens and almost 60 non-governmental organisations.
The public hearing took place on 25 January 2005.
There were more than 200 registered participants, representing the above-mentioned stakeholders.
The issue of the possible competence of the Agency with respect to Article 7 TEU was the subject of divergent views: while Member States were in general very prudent on this issue, NGOs wished the Agency to play a strong role in this respect.
The Council may exploit the expertise of the Agency if it finds it useful when acting on a proposal by one third of the Member States, by the European Parliament or by the Commission during the procedure under Article 7 TEU.
It aims to collaborate closely with relevant organisations and bodies in order to gain synergies, as presented in Chapter 7 of the Impact Assessment Report.
In order to cooperate and to avoid any overlapping, the Agency will build close institutional relationship with the Council of Europe and the relevant Community agencies and Union bodies, especially with the European Institute for Gender Equality, concerning which the Commission presented a proposal on 8 March 2005.
Indicative financial planning is as follows: Budget 2007: €16 million; 2008: €20 million; 2009: €21 million; 2010: €23 million; 2011: €26 million; 2012: €28 million; 2013: €29 million.
