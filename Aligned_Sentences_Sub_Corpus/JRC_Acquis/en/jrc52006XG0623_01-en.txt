STATES that health determinants have an impact on diabetes and that, apart from family history and increasing age, the main risk factors of Type 2 diabetes are excess body weight, a sedentary lifestyle, tobacco use and/or high blood pressure, which can be influenced by taking action in respect of the underlying factors.

The impact of Type 2 diabetes on women in their early reproductive years is of particular concern. 11.

Socio-economically disadvantaged groups, persons with lower education and minority groups, including women in their reproductive years, need particular attention, acknowledging the fact that they are more often affected by Type 2 diabetes and with regard to bridging inequalities in health. 3.
In order to have a sound basis for policy planning and evaluation, the occurrence of Type 2 diabetes and its risk factors as well as the immediate and long term outcomes of improved programmes of care need to be systematically monitored and reported both in the member states and at EU level using a valid methodology and comparative data. 6.
