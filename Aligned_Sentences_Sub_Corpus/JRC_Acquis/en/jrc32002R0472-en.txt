It is therefore appropriate to establish maximum limits for the species of spices which are used in large quantity and which have a high incidence of contamination. (6) The maximum limits should be reviewed and, if necessary, reduced before 31 December 2003 taking into account possibilities to reduce aflatoxin contamination in spices by improvements in production, harvesting and storage methods and the progress of scientific and technological knowledge. (7) Ochratoxin A is a mycotoxin produced by several fungi (Penicillium and Aspergillus species).
The Commission shall review the maximum limits for aflatoxins laid down in point 2.1.4 of section 2 of Annex I by 31 December 2003 at the latest and, if appropriate, reduce them to take account of the progress of scientific and technological knowledge.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the 10th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
It shall apply from 5 April 2002.
