Communication from the Commission to the Council on risk and crisis management in agriculture {SEC(2005) 320} /* COM/2005/0074 final */ Brussels, 09.03.2005 COM(2005) 74 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL on risk and crisis management in agriculture {SEC(2005) 320} 1.
The Spanish Presidency took up the issue of agricultural insurance as a risk management tool in arable and livestock farming with a memorandum in March 2002, followed by an international conference on “Agricultural insurance and income guarantees”, held in Madrid on 13 and 14 May 2002.
A Greek Presidency memorandum on natural risks and insurance in the agricultural sector was submitted to the Council in May 2003 and a seminar to examine possible responses to natural disasters in the agricultural sector was held in Thessaloniki on 6 June 2003.
Most recently, on 15 and 16 December 2004, the Dutch Presidency organised a conference on the “Material and immaterial costs of eradication of animal diseases”.
The CAP reform decided in Luxembourg in June 2003 provides for a modified system of farm income support to farmers, decoupled from production.
The wide range of risk management tools available is described in a Commission Staff Working Document accompanying this Communication.
The Commission has looked at a number of options for encouraging the development of risk management tools and providing an improved response in the event of crisis.
Finally, three options are described that, in combination or individually, could in time complete or partially replace Community and Member States’ ad hoc emergency measures.
These possible new measures are presented in section 3.3. 3.1 Generalising safety net provisions in the event of market crisis While CAP reform has decoupled income support for the main production sectors, a number of instruments remain to influence the market and price situation and address possible crises.
Under the 2003 CAP reform, modulation will progressively reduce direct payments on a compulsory community-wide basis, by 3% in 2005, 4% in 2006 and 5% in the years 2007 to 2012.
Finally, in order to guarantee fair competition throughout the Community, the possibility of using state aids or top ups in this context would have to be carefully assessed by the Commission.
