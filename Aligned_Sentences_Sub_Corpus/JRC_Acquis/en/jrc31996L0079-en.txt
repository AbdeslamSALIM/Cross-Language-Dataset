Position of the front seat-backs If adjustable, the seat-backs must be adjusted so that the resulting inclination of the torso of the dummy is as close as possible to that recommended by the manufacturer for normal use or, in the absence of any particular recommendation by the manufacturer, to 25 ° towards the rear from the vertical. 1.4.3.11.3.
Front seats 2.1.1.
A dummy corresponding to the specifications for Hybrid III (1) fitted with a 45 ° ankle and meeting the specifications for its adjustment is installed in each of the front outboard seats in accordance with the conditions set out in Appendix 3.

Measurements in the femur and tibia of the dummy 5.2.4.1.
The displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur is measured at the knee sliding joint with a CFC of 180. 6.
To enable the simplified test described in Appendix 4 to be carried out, the deceleration curve of the structure must be determined on the basis of the value of the longitudinal accelerometers at the base of the 'B` pillar on the struck side of the vehicle with a CFC of 180 by means of data channels corresponding to the requirements set out in Appendix 5. 6.2.
The speed curve which will be used in the test procedure described in Appendix 4 must be obtained from the longitudinal accelerometer at the 'B` pillar on the side struck. (1) The technical specifications and detailed drawings of Hybrid III, corresponding to the principal dimensions of a 50th percentile male of the United States of America, and the specifications for its adjustment for this test are deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and may be consulted on request at the secretariat of the Economic Commission for Europe, Palais des Nations, Geneva, Switzerland.
Appendix 2 DETERMINATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 1.
Values of HPC for which the time interval (t1 - t2) is greater than 36 ms are ignored for the purposes of calculating the maximum value. 1.3.
The value of the resultant head acceleration during forward impact which is exceeded for 3 ms cumulatively is calculated from the resultant head acceleration measured according to paragraph 5.2.1 of Appendix 1 to this Annex. 2.
These criteria are determined by the compressive axial force, the axial tensile force and the fore/aft shear forces at the head/neck interface, expressed in kN and measured according to paragraph 5.2.2 of Appendix 1 to this Annex and by the duration of these forces expressed in ms. 2.2.
The neck bending moment criterion is determined by the bending moment, expressed in Nm, about a lateral axis at the head/neck interface and measured according to paragraph 5.2.2 of Appendix 1 to this Annex. 2.3.
The thorax compression criterion is determined by the absolute value of the thorax deformation, expressed in mm and measured according to paragraph 5.2.3 of Appendix 1 to this Annex. 3.2.
The viscous criterion (V*C) is calculated as the instantaneous product of the compression and the rate of deflection of the sternum, measured according to paragraph 6 and also paragraph 5.2.3 of Appendix 1 to this Annex. 4.
This criterion is determined by the compression load expressed in kN, transmitted axially on each femur of the dummy and measured according to paragraph 5.2.4 of Appendix 1 to this Annex and by the duration of the compressive load expressed in ms. 5.
TIBIA COMPRESSIVE FORCE CRITERION (TCFC) AND TIBIA INDEX (TI) 5.1.
The tibia compressive force criterion is determined by the compressive load (Fz) expressed in kN, transmitted axially on each tibia of the dummy and measured according to paragraph 5.2.4 of Appendix 1 to Annex II. 5.2.
The tibia index is calculated on the basis of the bending moments (MX and MY) measured according to paragraph 5.1 by the following expression: TI= | %gt%NUM%gt%MR/ %gt%DEN%gt%(MC)R| + | %gt%NUM%gt%FZ/ %gt%DEN%gt%(FC)Z | where: MX= bending moment about the x axis MY = bending moment about the y axis (MC)R = critical bending moment and shall be taken to be 225 Nm FZ = compressive axial force in the z direction (FC)Z = critical compressive force in the z direction and shall be taken to be 35,9 kN MR = %amp%radic;(MX)² + (MY)² The tibia index is calculated for the top and the bottom of each tibia; however, Fz may be measured at either location.
Moments MX and MY are both measured separately at both locations. 6.
PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATING THE VISCOUS CRITERION (V*C) FOR HYBRID III DUMMY 6.1.
Both are derived from the measurement of sternum deflection. 6.2.
The sternum deflection response is filtered once at CFC 180.
The compression at time t is calculated from this filtered signal as: C(t) = %gt%NUM%gt%D(t) %gt%DEN%gt%0,229 The sternum deflection velocity at time t is calculated from the filtered deflection as: V(t) = %gt%NUM%gt%8×(D(t+1) - D(t-1)) - (D(t+2) - D(t-2)) %gt%DEN%gt%12ät where D(2) is the deflection at time t in metres and ät is the time interval in seconds between the measurements of deflection.
The maximum value of ät is 1,25 × 10-4 seconds.
