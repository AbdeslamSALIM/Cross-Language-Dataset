The test portion shall be delivered as completely as possible into the lower (small) bulb of the extraction flasks. 6.3.
Blank test Carry out the blank test simultaneously with the determination using the same procedure and same reagents, but replacing the test portion by 10 to 11 ml of water.
The change in apparent mass of the fat collecting vessel, corrected for apparent change in mass of the control vessel, should not be greater than 2,5 mg. 6.4.
Determination 6.5.1.
Add 10 ml of the ethanol (4.2.) and mix gently but thoroughly by allowing the contents of the flask to flow backwards and forwards between the two bulbs; avoid bringing the liquid too near to the neck of the flask.
If desired, add two drops of the Congo red or Cresol red solution (4.3.). 6.5.3.
Add 25 ml of diethyl ether (4.4.), close the flask with a cork saturated with water or with a stopper wetted with water (see 5.6.), and shake the flask vigorously, but not excessively (in order to avoid the formation of persistant emulsions), for one minute with the flask in a horizontal position and the small bulb extending upwards.
If necessary, cool the flask in running water, then carefully remove the cork or stopper and rinse it and the neck of the flask with a little of the mixed solvent (4.6.) using the wash bottle (5.8.) so that the rinsings run into the flask. 6.5.4.
Centrifuge the closed flask for one to five minutes at a rotational frequency of 500 to 600 rev min 1 (5.2.).
If a centrifuge is not available (see note to 5.2.) allow the closed flask to stand in the rack (5.7.) for at least 30 minutes until the supernatant layer is clear and distinctly separated from the aqueous layer.
If necessary, cool the flask in running water. 6.5.6.
Holding the extraction flask by the small bulb, carefully decant as much as possible of the supernatant layer into the prepared fat-collecting vessel (6.4.) containing a few boiling aids (5.10.) in the case of flasks (optional with metal dishes), avoiding decantation of any of the aqueous layer. 6.5.8.
Rinse the outside of the neck of the extraction flask with a little of the mixed solvent (4.6.), collecting the rinsings in the fat-collecting vessel and taking care that the mixed solvent does not spread over the outside of the extraction flask.
Add 5 ml of the ethanol (4.2.) to the contents of the extraction flask, using the ethanol to rinse the inside of the neck of the flask and mix as decribed in 6.5.2. 6.5.10.
Remove the fat-collecting vessel from the oven, allow to cool (not in a desiccator, but protected from dust) to the temperature of the weighing room (for glass vessels allow at least one hour, for metal dishes allow at least 30 minutes) and weigh to the nearest 0,1 mg.
Add 25 ml of light petroleum to the fat-collecting vessel in order to verify whether or not the extracted matter is wholly soluble.
If the extracted matter is wholly soluble in the light petroleum, take the mass of fat as the difference between the final mass of the vessel containing the extracted matter (6.5.14.) and its initial mass (6.4.). 6.5.16.
EXPRESSION OF RESULTS 7.1.
Precision 7.2.1.
Reproducibility (R): - for whole milk: 0,04 g of fat per 100 g of product, - for partly skimmed milk: 0,03 g of fat per 100 g of product, - for skimmed milk: 0,025 g of fat per 100 g of product.
DETERMINATION OF TOTAL NON-FAT SOLIDS 1.
SCOPE AND FIELD OF APPLICATION This procedure specifies the reference method for the determination of the content of total non-fat solids in heat-treated milk. 2.
DETERMINATION OF TOTAL NITROGEN CONTENT 1.
Potassium sulphate (K2SO4). 4.2.
Dissolve 5,0 g of copper (II) sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4, 5H2O) in water and dilute to 100 ml (at 20 oC) in a volumetric flask. 4.3.
Sodium hydroxide solution, 47 % (m/m) 704 g NaOH/l (20 oC).
Note: A less concentrated sodium hydroxide solution may be used for example: 40 % (m/m) 572 g/l, 20 oC; or 30 % (m/m) 399 g/l, 20 oC. 4.5.
Dissolve 40 g of boric acid (H3BO3) in one litre of hot water, allow to cool, and store in a borosilicate glass bottle. 4.6.
Dissolve 0,01 g methyl red, 0,02 g bromothymol blue and 0,06 g bromocresol green in 100 ml of ethanol.
Store the solution in a brown closed bottle, in a cool, dark place. 4.7.
Ammonium salt, pure, such as ammonium oxalate (NH4)2C2O4, H2O or ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4. 4.10.
Tryptophan (C11H12N2O2), phenacetin (C10H7CH2CONH2) or lysine mono- or di-hydrochloride (C6H14N2O2 7 HCl or C6H14N2O2 7 2HCl).
APPARATUS AND GLASSWARE Usual laboratory equipment and, in particular: 5.1.
Kjeldahl flasks of capacity 500 ml. 5.2.
Pipette or automatic pipette, to deliver 0,10 ml. 5.8.
Conical flasks, of capacity 500 ml, graduated at 200 ml. 5.9.
Burette of capacity 50 ml, gratuated in 0,1 ml, maximum error ±0,05 ml. 5.10.
Automatic burette. 6.
Note: Because organic matter consumes sulphuric acid during boiling, use 30 ml of H2SO4 (4.3.), instead of 25 ml for digestion, if the milk contains more than 5,0 % (m/m) of fat.
This should also be done in the blank test. 6.2.
If the residual volume of H2SO4 is less than approximately 15 ml at the end of the digestion time, nitrogen may have been lost because of excessive heating.
Then to each flask, add 70 ml of sodium hydroxide solution (4.4.) (see note) by gently pouring the solution down the inclined neck of the flask to form a bottom layer in the bulb; do not wet the top of the neck with the sodium hydroxide solution.
Note: It is necessary that the combined volume of water and sodium hydroxide solution total 370 ml to enable approximately 150 ml of distillate to be collected just before irregular boiling ('bumping`) ensues (6.4.).
For example, if 85 ml of 40 % (m/m) or 125 ml of 30 % (m/m) sodium hydroxide solution are to be added, the volume of water added shall be 285 ml or 245 ml respectively. 6.4.
Immediately connect each Kjeldahl flask to a distillation apparatus (5.6.).
Ensure that the tip of the condenser outlet-tube is immersed in 50 ml of boric acid solution (4.5.) together with 0,20 ml (5 6 drops) of indicator solution (4.6.) all contained in a conical flask (5.8.).
Swirl the contents of each Kjeldahl flask to mix thoroughly and boil, but gently at first to prevent excessive frothing.
When 100 to 125 ml of distillate have been collected, lower each conical flask until the tip of the condenser outlet-tube is approximately 40 mm above the 200 ml mark.
Disconnect each Kjeldahl flask and rinse the tip of each condenser outlet-tube with a little water, collecting the rinsings in the conical flask.
Titrate until the colour of the distillate corresponds to that of a solution recently prepared from 150 ml of water to which has been added 50 ml of the boric acid solution and 0,20 ml of the indicator contained in a conical flask (5.8). 6.6.
inclusive, taking 5 ml of distilled water together with about 0,1 g of sucrose (4.8.) through the procedure instead of the milk sample.
Check that the digestion procedure is sufficient to release all the protein nitrogen by using a test portion of 0,20 g of pure tryptophan, 0,35 g of phenacetin or 0,20 g of lysine hydrochloride (4.10.).
EXPRESSION OF RESULTS 8.1.
Precision 8.2.1.
Repeatability (r): 0,007 g per 100 g. 8.2.2.
Reproducibility (R): 0,015 g per 100 g. 9.
MODIFIED PROCEDURES 9.1.
A test portion of 1 g of milk (semi-macro Kjeldahl) can be used instead of 5 g (6.1.) provided: - the amounts of the reagents used for mineralization (6.1.): H2SO4, CuSO4 7 5 H2O, K2SO4, are reduced to the same ratio (1/5). - the total digestion time (6.2.) is reduced to 75 minutes. - the amount of sodium hydroxide solution (6.3.) is reduced to the same ratio (1/5). - an acid standard solution (4.7.) of lower concentration (0,02 to 0,03 mol/l) has to be used.
SCOPE AND FIELD OF APPLICATION This procedure specifies the reference method for the determination of the content of protein in heat treated milk (Article 3 A3 in Directive 85/397/EEC). 2.
DETERMINATION OF SPECIFIC MASS 1.
SCOPE AND FIELD OF APPLICATION This procedure specifies the reference method for the determination of the specific mass at 20 oC of raw milk and of whole milk, partly skimmed milk and skimmed milk. 2.
DEFINITION The specific mass of the milk is the ratio of the mass of a certain volume of milk at 20 oC to that of the mass of the same volume of water at 20 oC. 3.
PRINCIPLE The specific mass at 20 oC is determined by a hydrometer. 4.
APPARATUS AND GLASSWARE Usual laboratory equipment and, in particular: 4.1.
The rod includes a graduated scale from 1,025 to 1,035 g/ml.
Water bath regulated at 20±0,1 oC. 4.4.
Water bath regulated at 40±2 oC. 4.5.
Cool to 20 oC in the second water bath (4.3). 5.2.
TEMPERATURE CORRECTION 6.1.
If the temperature of the milk sample is not exactly 20 oC when the measurement of its specific mass is made, then the result obtained must be corrected adding to the determined specific mass 0,0002 for each degree Celcius above 20 oC, or subtracting 0,0002 for every degree Celsius below 20 oC.
This correction is only valid if the temperature of the milk sample differs by not more than 5 oC from 20 oC. 7.
Repeatability (r): 0,0003 g/ml. 8.2.
PROCEDURE A.1.1.
Blank test See 6.3.
Preparation of fat-collecting vessel See 6.4.
Determination A.1.5.1.
Add 10 ml of the ethanol (4.2.) and mix gently but thoroughly at the bottom of the tube.
Add 25 ml of light petroleum (4.5.), close the tube with the rewetted cork or stopper (rewet by dipping in water), and shake the tube gently for 30 seconds as described in A.1.5.3.
Centrifuge the closed tube for one to five minutes at a rotational frequency of 500 to 600 rev min-1 (5.2.).
If the centrifuge is not available (see note to 5.2.), allow the closed tube to stand in the rack (5.7.) for at least 30 minutes until the supernatant layer is clear and distincly separated from the aqueous layer.
If necessary, cool the tube in running water.
Insert a siphon fitting or a wash-bottle fitting into the tube and push down the long inner limb of the fitting until the inlet is approximately 3 mm above the interface between the layers.
The inner limb of the fitting shall be parallel to the axis of the extraction tube.
Again loosen the fitting from the neck, slightly raise the fitting and add 5 ml of the ethanol to the contents of the tube, using the ethanol to rinse the long inner limb of the fitting; mix as described in A.1.5.2.
Carry out the second extraction by repeating the operations described in A.1.5.3.
