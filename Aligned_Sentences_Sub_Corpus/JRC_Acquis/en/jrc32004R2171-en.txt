In the case of such operators, the competent authorities may authorise imports not exceeding the quantities imported in 2004 from given third countries and in given categories, provided that enough quota capacity is available.
Article 3 Any importer who has already used up 50 % or more of the amount allocated to him under this Regulation may make a further application, in respect of the same category and country of origin, for amounts not exceeding the maximum quantities laid down in Annex I.
They shall issue authorisations only if an operator: (a) proves the existence of a contract relating to the provision of the goods and, (b) certifies in writing that, in respect of the categories and countries concerned: (i) he has not already been allocated an authorisation under this Regulation, or (ii) he has been allocated an authorisation under this Regulation but has used up at least 50 % of it. 3.
Import authorisations shall be valid for nine months from the date of issue, but until 31 December 2005 at the latest.
The competent national authorities may, however, at the importerâ€™s request, grant a three-month extension for authorisations which are at least 50 % used up at the time of the request.
Such extension shall in no circumstances expire later than 31 March 2006.
