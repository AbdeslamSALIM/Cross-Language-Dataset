Costs of soil degradation Though difficult to estimate, several studies demonstrate significant annual costs of soil degradation to society in the ranges of: erosion: | €0.7 – 14.0 billion [7], | organic matter decline: | €3.4 – 5.6 billion, | compaction: | no estimate possible, | salinisation: | €158 – 321 million [8], | landslides: | up to €1.2 billion per event, | contamination: | €2.4 – 17.3 billion [9], | sealing: | no estimate possible, | biodiversity decline: | no estimate possible. | These costs do not include the damage to the ecological functions of soil as these were not possible to quantify.
On the other hand it must be highlighted that these costs of soil degradation do not take into account the effect of standards adopted in January 2005 under cross-compliance, or the effect of other measures recently taken by Member States.
The costs for this first five-year stage are estimated at about €51 million per year for EU25.
