At its 427th plenary session, held on 17- 18 May 2006 (meeting of 17 May), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 133 votes to one with eight abstentions. 1.
The EESC restates the position expressed on this matter in its opinions of 24 September 2003 [1] and 28 October 2004 [2], which was that the constitutional treaty was a key instrument to enable the Union to address the challenges it faces.
Having regard also to the European Parliament resolution of 19 January 2006 on The period of reflection (the structure, subject and context for an assessment of the debate on the European Union). 4.
The EESC takes the view that: - the absence of a clear vision and of a consensus on the aims and purposes of European integration have fuelled doubts, despite the successes and achievements of 50 years of European integration; - public scepticism relates more to the EU's functioning and current policies than to the Constitutional Treaty itself, whose innovative nature has not been adequately explained to the public; - the current institutional system, set up by the Nice Treaty, will not enable the European Union to progress on the path of integration.
In this context, the EESC welcomes the fact that the inter-institutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission reached on 4 April 2006 commits to an increase in the 2007-2013 financial perspective above that initially agreed by the European Council.
On this matter, it refers to the opinion it issued on the subject on 15 September 2004 [3]; - for a communication strategy on Europe to be successful, it is important first to: - set out a clear vision of the future of Europe; - formulate and implement policies that give real added value to the public; - raise the profile of European integration and its aims, and make them easier to understand; - make the workings of the Union more democratic, in particular ensuring greater involvement of citizens and a more structured dialogue with organised civil society. 5.
The EESC issues the following recommendations to the European Council of 15 and 16 June 2006: 5.1 Responsibilities 5.1.1 The responsibility for finding a rapid way out of the identity crisis the European Union is currently experiencing is largely in the hands of the Member States, and thus of the European Council.
The June 2006 summit must therefore put out a clear message on the future of Europe and open up avenues that will provide a way out of the current political impasse.
