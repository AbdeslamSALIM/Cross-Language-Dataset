At its 413th plenary session of 15 and 16 December 2004 (meeting of 15 December 2004), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 142 votes to one with nine abstentions.
In the meantime, these interventions have gradually been abolished. 1.6 New views of industrial policy are being examined.
The ultra-rapid developments in world markets do not leave much choice for Europe. 2.21 What is especially new in this Commission document is the sectoral dimension.
For several years the Commission has been conducting in-depth studies on sectors, often based on consultations with sectoral organisations on EU level. 2.22 Interesting proposals have been made which have also been discussed by the EESC, regarding for example the pharmaceutical industry (CESE 842/2004), textiles and clothing (CESE 62/2004 fin; CCMI Supplementary Opinion CESE 528/2004), shipbuilding and ship-repair (CESE 397/2004 fin; CCMI Supplementary Opinion CESE 478/2004), space (CESE 501/2004), the chemical industry (CESE 524/2004; CCMI Information Report CESE 242/2004, currently under preparation) and life sciences and biotechnology (CESE 1010/2002; CESE 920/2003). 2.23 The picture varies from sector to sector.
Certain aspects of Europe's industry (such as the environment) have been on the EU agenda for the last decade, but the Council of Ministers has neglected to discuss policies that would improve coherently the conditions for overall output and that would sustain pro-actively the environment for (value-added) investments. 3.2 In retrospect, and in view of the present change to a more focused industrial approach, it is worthwhile to summarize the main factors that have contributed to a certain taboo on industrial policy: - the failure of state intervention, in the large majority of cases, to make industry stronger and more competitive in the long run; - the abolition of economically unjustified market distortions and promotion of a level playing field for industrial activities in Europe (although specific measures adopted in some Member States which distort competition need still to be scrutinised in a appropriate way at EU-level); - the overall and successful emphasis on liberalisation of markets; - the exaggerated expectations of the "new economy" and of a post-industrial era; - the focus on implementing EMU and adequate macro-economic policies; - the loss of influence of the Ministries responsible for industrial interests in a number of Member States. 3.3 Most of what is presented by the Commission in its Communication has already been known for several years.
Unfortunately, such an approach is very difficult to realise in a complicated environment in which the EU institutions have to come to terms with 25 Member States.
The Commission rightly cites cases as G10, STAR 21 and LeaderShip as examples. 3.26 LeaderShip 2015 [16] is a graphic example, provided it is executed correctly.

The Committee issued its Opinion on 17.7.2003 (Official Journal C 234, 30.9.2003, pages 76-85).
The importance of a transparent and visible framework, especially as concerns the Competitiveness Council, is underlined in the EESC opinion on Better economic governance in the EU. [14] See also Mr Liikanen's speech on 27 May in favour of an active industrial policy (cf.
