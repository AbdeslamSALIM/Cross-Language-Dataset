The other Member States were informed of the request on 15 October 2004. (2) The derogating measure is intended to exclude certain magazines and periodicals imported into Denmark from the exemption under Article 14(1)(d) of the Directive and to apply VAT on them.
The Danish limit for VAT exemption is DKK 80 (EU-10). (3) The Danish authorities have discovered that some publishing companies re-route the distribution of their publications to subscribers in Denmark via territories not covered by the Sixth Directive, with a loss in revenue for Denmark and consequently with a negative impact on the Communityâ€™s own resources.
There is the risk that the loss of revenue will increase unless Denmark is authorised to prevent this type of tax avoidance. (4) The request for derogation only targets the consignments and situations connected with the avoidance scheme and does not intend to exclude all mail order consignments from the exemption on the basis of Article 22 of Directive 83/181/EEC.
Article 2 This Decision shall apply until 31 December 2010.
Article 3 This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark.
