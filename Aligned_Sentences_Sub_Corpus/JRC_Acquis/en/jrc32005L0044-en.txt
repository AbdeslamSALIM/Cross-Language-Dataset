This Directive establishes a framework for the deployment and use of harmonised river information services (RIS) in the Community in order to support inland waterway transport with a view to enhancing safety, efficiency and environmental friendliness and to facilitating interfaces with other transport modes. 2.
Continuity shall be ensured with other modal traffic management services, in particular maritime vessel traffic management and information services.
