The definition of such substances in Directive 96/82/EC should therefore be clarified and simplified. (6) The explosion at a fertiliser plant in Toulouse in September 2001 has raised awareness of the accident potential arising from the storage of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers, in particular of material rejected during the manufacturing process or returned to the manufacturer (off-specs).
The Commission is invited by 31 December 2006, in close cooperation with the Member States, to draw up guidelines defining a technical database including risk data and risk scenarios, to be used for assessing the compatibility between the establishments covered by this Directive and the areas described in paragraph 1.
Such training shall be given to all personnel working in the establishment, including relevant subcontracted personnel.%quot% Article 2 1.

For the purposes of this Directive, a gas is any substance that has an absolute vapour pressure equal to or greater than 101,3 kPa at a temperature of 20 ì§¸ C. 7.
Ammonium nitrate (5000/10000): fertilisers capable of self-sustaining decomposition This applies to ammonium nitrate-based compound/composite fertilisers (compound/composite fertilisers containing ammonium nitrate with phosphate and/or potash) in which the nitrogen content as a result of ammonium nitrate is - between 15,75 % (1) and 24,5 % (2) by weight, and either with not more than 0,4 % total combustible/organic materials or which fulfil the requirements of Annex II of Directive 80/876/EEC, - 15,75 % (3) by weight or less and unrestricted combustible materials, and which are capable of self-sustaining decomposition according to the UN Trough Test (see United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods: Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part III, subsection 38.2). 2.
Ammonium nitrate (1250/5000): fertiliser grade This applies to straight ammonium nitrate-based fertilisers and to ammonium nitrate-based compound/composite fertilisers in which the nitrogen content as a result of ammonium nitrate is - more than 24,5 % by weight, except for mixtures of ammonium nitrate with dolomite, limestone and/or calcium carbonate with a purity of at least 90 %, - more than 15,75 % by weight for mixtures of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate, - more than 28 % (4) by weight for mixtures of ammonium nitrate with dolomite, limestone and/or calcium carbonate with a purity of at least 90 %, and which fulfil the requirements of Annex II of Directive 80/876/EEC. 3.
Ammonium nitrate (350/2500): technical grade This applies to: - ammonium nitrate and preparations of ammonium nitrate in which the nitrogen content as a result of the ammonium nitrate is - between 24,5 % and 28 % by weight, and which contain not more than 0,4 % combustible substances, - more than 28 % by weight, and which contain not more than 0,2 % combustible substances, - aqueous ammonium nitrate solutions in which the concentration of ammonium nitrate is more than 80 % by weight. 4.
For the purposes of this Directive, the Commission shall establish and keep up to date a list of substances which have been classified into the above categories by a harmonised Decision in accordance with Directive 67/548/EEC.%quot% (ii) Note 2 is replaced by the following: %quot%%gt%TABLE%gt% 2.
gases which are flammable in contact with air at ambient temperature and pressure (risk phrase R12, second indent), which are in a gaseous or supercritical state, and%quot% (v) note 3(c)3 is replaced by the following: %quot%3.
flammable and highly flammable liquid substances and preparations maintained at a temperature above their boiling point.%quot% (vi) note 4 is replaced by the following: %quot%4.
is greater than or equal to 1, where qx = the quantity of dangerous substance x (or category of dangerous substances) falling within Parts 1 or 2 of this Annex, and QUX = the relevant qualifying quantity for substance or category x from column 3 of Parts 1 or 2.
This Directive shall apply, with the exception of Articles 9, 11 and 13, if the sum q1/QL1 + q2/QL2 + q3/QL3 + q4/QL4 + q5/QL5 +...
is greater than or equal to 1, where qx = the quantity of dangerous substance x (or category of dangerous substances) falling within Parts 1 or 2 of this Annex, and QLX = the relevant qualifying quantity for substance or category x from column 2 of Parts 1 or 2.
