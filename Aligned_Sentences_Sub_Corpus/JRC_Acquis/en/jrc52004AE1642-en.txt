At its 413th plenary session on 15 and 16 December 2004 (meeting of 15 December 2004), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 138 votes, with 8 abstentions. 1.
Summary of the Communication 1.1 The Thessaloniki European Council of July 2003 stressed the need for the EU to explore legal means for third country nationals to migrate to the Union, taking into account the reception capacity of the Member States, within the framework of an enhanced co-operation with the countries of origin.
Within the EU, the shadow economy represents between 7 % and 16 % of GDP. 1.7 The impact of existing legal channels, such as bilateral agreements, on reducing illegal immigration is extremely difficult to gauge.
Reference is also made to the importance of promoting greater mobility in the EU labour market, which has already been facilitated by the 2003 Directive on long-term residents [2] and by Regulation 1408/71.
The Commission proposes to create a financial instrument for return management for the years 2005 and 2006. 1.16 Lastly, the Commission states that this study has confirmed that stepping up cooperation with countries of origin or transit is necessary to reduce illegal migration flows and to organise legal immigration.
The EESC has already stated in various opinions that there is a clear link between legal immigration and illegal immigration.
EUROPOL and EUROJUST must be provided with the most appropriate political, legal and administrative instruments.
With this aim in mind, the Committee will be putting in place a permanent instrument [23] in conjunction with the Commission, with the social partners and with civil society organisations.
