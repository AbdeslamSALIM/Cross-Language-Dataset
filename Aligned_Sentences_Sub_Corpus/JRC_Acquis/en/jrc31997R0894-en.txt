TITLE I NETS AND CONDITIONS FOR THEIR USE Article 2 Minimum mesh sizes 1.
For each of the regions or geographical areas mentioned in Annex I and depending, where applicable, on the period and engine power, it is prohibited to use any trawl, Danish seine or similar towed net unless its mesh size in that part of the net having the smallest meshes is equal to, or greater than, one of the minimum mesh sizes listed in that Annex, hereinafter known as 'the reference minimum mesh size`, and unless the catch taken with that net and retained on board includes: - a percentage of authorized target species equal to or greater than that specified in Annex I, - a percentage of protected species which does not exceed that specified in Annex I, for the reference minimum mesh size.
Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, the minimum percentage of target species may be obtained by aggregating the quantities of all the target species caught, provided that: - they are target species for which the maximum percentage of protected species is 10 %, - they are target species for which the reference minimum mesh size is the same as, or less than, the mesh of the net in use, - the total percentage for all protected species combined as a proportion of the total weight of all the target species combined does not exceed 10 %.
However, it shall be prohibited to have on board or to land more than 10 % of protected species when fishing with dredges. 3.
The percentages referred to in Annex I shall be calculated as the proportion by weight of all fish, crustaceans and molluscs on board after sorting or on landing, taking into account any quantities which have been transhipped.
Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, when fishing for sand-eel with nets having mesh sizes smaller than 16 mm, the percentage may be measured before sorting.
This provision shall not apply in the Skagerrak and Kattegat.
Rules for sampling may be drawn up in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18. 4.
Nets with mesh sizes smaller than the mesh size of the net in use in conformity with paragraph 1 shall not be kept on board unless they are properly lashed and stowed in such a way that they may not be readily used.
Specific rules concerning stowage of gear may be drawn up in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18. 8.
The unit in which engine power is expressed shall be the kilowatt (kW).
The amendments necessary for adapting the requirements, provided for in the fourth subparagraph, to technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18. 9.
It shall be prohibited to have on board or to use any trawl, Danish seine or similar towed net of which the minimum mesh size is equal to or greater than 90 mm having more than 100 meshes in the circumference at least of the cod-end sensu stricto, excluding the joinings and selvedges.
Detailed rules for the application of this paragraph, including the measurement of mesh size, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18, no later than 31 December 1997.
Article 4 Attachments to nets No device shall be used by means of which the mesh in any part of the fishing net is obstructed or otherwise effectively diminished.
