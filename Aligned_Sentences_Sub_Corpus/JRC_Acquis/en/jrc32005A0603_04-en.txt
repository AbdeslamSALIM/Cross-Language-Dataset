The programme's projections for inflation also appear realistic. (3) On 3 June 2003, the Council decided that an excessive deficit existed in France and recommended that this be corrected by 2004 at the latest.
In its Communication to the Council on "the situation of Germany and France in relation to their obligation under the excessive deficit procedure following the judgement of the Court of Justice" adopted on 14 December 2004 [2], the Commission concluded that 2005 should be considered the relevant deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit since the Council conclusions of November 2003 had produced legal effects until annulled by the Court.
As in previous updates, the medium-term budgetary strategy is based on the setting of multi-annual targets for the increase in government expenditures in real terms that imply a reduction of the expenditure-to-GDP ratio notably as a consequence of the implementation of structural reforms. (4) Based on current information, measures taken by the French authorities should be sufficient to bring the deficit to 3 % of GDP in 2005.
In particular, the deficit objective for 2006 appears at risk under current policies, given that tax cuts are announced for that year and that major one-off revenues will vanish.
The programme projects the debt ratio to decline from 2006 onwards and to reach 62 % of GDP in 2008.
However, further efforts (additional budgetary consolidation and reforms) would be needed in the years ahead in order to ensure fully the sustainability of government finances. (8) The economic policies as reflected in the 2004 update are partly consistent with the recommendations in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, specifically those with budgetary implications.
The cyclically-adjusted deficit in 2004 will be reduced by 0.4 % of GDP, lower than recommended.
In view of the above assessment, the Council is of the opinion that France should: (i) do the necessary to ensure the correction of the excessive deficit in 2005; (ii) make sure that the budgetary consolidation continues in the years after 2005 so as to reach a close to balance budgetary position in 2008; and (iii) continue structural reforms and control expenditure in order to secure the respect of the multi-annual expenditure targets set in the programme. | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | Real GDP(% change) | SP Dec 2004 | 2,5 | 2,5 | 2,5 | 2,5 | 2,5 | COM Oct 2004 | 2,4 | 2,2 | 2,2 | n.a. | n.a. | SP Dec 2003 | 1,7 | 2,5 | 2,5 | 2,5 | n.a. | HICP inflation(%) | SP Dec 2004 | 2,2 | 1,8 | 1,5 | 1,5 | 1,5 | COM Oct 2004 | 2,3 | 2,0 | 1,8 | n.a. | n.a. | SP Dec 2003 | 1,5 | 1,5 | 1,5 | 1,5 | n.a. | General government balance(% of GDP) | SP Dec 2004 | -3,6 | -2,9 | -2,2 | -1,6 | -0,9 | COM Oct 2004 | -3,7 | -3,0 | -3,3 | n.a. | n.a. | SP Dec 2003 | -3,55 | -2,9 | -2,2 | -1,5 | n.a. | Primary balance(% of GDP) | SP Dec 2004 | -0,7 | 0,1 | 0,8 | 1,5 | 2,2 | COM Oct 2004 | -0,7 | -0,1 | -0,4 | n.a. | n.a. | SP Dec 2003 | -0,6 | 0,1 | 0,9 | 1,6 | n.a. | Cyclically-adjusted balance(% of GDP) | SP Dec 2004 | -3,4 | -2,7 | -2,0 | -1,4 | -0,7 | COM Oct 2004 | -3,5 | -2,8 | -3,1 | n.a. | n.a. | SP Dec 2003 | -3,2 | -2,6 | -1,9 | -1,3 | n.a. | Government gross debt(% of GDP) | SP Dec 2004 | 64,8 | 65,0 | 64,6 | 63,6 | 62,0 | COM Oct 2004 | 64,9 | 65,5 | 66,3 | n.a. | n.a. | SP Dec 2003 | 62,8 | 63,2 | 62,8 | 61,8 | n.a. | [1] OJ L 209, 2.8.1997, p. 1 [2] Document COM(2004) 813 of 14 December 2004. --------------------------------------------------
