For the sake of clarity, the Annexes should be replaced in their entirety. (12) The Monegasque authorities did not request that the Joint Committee established by Article 14 of the Monetary Agreement be convened pursuant to Article 11(5) of that Agreement within two weeks following the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004 in order to update Annex B to the Monetary Agreement.
Annexes A and B to the Monetary Agreement must therefore both be amended by the Commission. (13) At its meetings on 17 June 2004 and 16 June 2005, the Commission informed the Joint Committee of the need to update Annexes A and B to the Monetary Agreement.
