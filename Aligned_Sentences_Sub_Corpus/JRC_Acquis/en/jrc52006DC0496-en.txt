INTRODUCTION In accordance with Article 21 of Directive 85/374[1] (‘the Directive’), the Commission must review the efficiency of the product liability legal framework on a regular basis.
The first report COM(1995) 617 was presented in 1995.
The second review exercise was launched with a Green Paper on Product Liability adopted in July 1999, COM(1999) 396 final, leading to the second report published on 31 January 2001, COM(2000) 893 final.
As it was requested by Council Resolution of 19 December 2002 on amendment of the liability for defective products Directive (2003/C 26/02), this report also considers the issue of suppliers’ liability.
Those circumstances will continue to be closely monitored by the European Commission. 2.
The Directive on product liability contains the following main elements: - liability without fault of the producer; - burden of proof on the victim as regards the damage, the defect and the causal relationship between the two; - joint and several liability of all the operators in the production chain, so as to provide a financial guarantee for compensation of the damage; - a 500 € threshold regarding damages suffered in order to avoid litigation in an excessive number of cases; - exoneration of the producer when he proves the existence of certain facts explicitly set out in the Directive; - liability limited in time, by virtue of uniform deadlines; - illegality of clauses limiting or excluding liability towards the victim.
In view of the different legal traditions, the Directive accepts that Member States derogate from the common rules (“options”) with regard to some points by: - not exonerating the producer even if he proves that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when he put the product into circulation was not such as to enable the existence of a defect to be discovered; - by fixing a financial ceiling of not less than 70 million EUR for damage resulting from death or personal injury and caused by identical items with the same defect. 3.
Moreover, two different working groups were set up in 2003 to bring together the opinions of professional and academic experts of recognized standing.
Directive 85/374/EEC has been transposed and is being put into application in the twenty five Member States. 3.1.
Council Resolution of 19 December 2002 on the amendment of liability for defective products[3] In this Resolution, the Council considered that there was a need to assess whether the Directive should be modified in such a way as to allow for national rules on liability of suppliers to be based on the same grounds as the liability system in the Directive concerning liability of producers. 3.2.
The Lovells Report (published in 2003) This study was carried out on behalf of the European Commission in order to analyse and compare the practical effects of the different systems applicable in Member States of the European Union regarding procedural aspects of claims for defective products.
Conclusions of the meetings held with the working groups (2003/2004) and conclusions extracted from the questionnaire prepared by the European Commission (2005/2006) The Economic and Social Committee in its opinion on the 1999 Green Paper advanced the idea of an observatory to monitor the functioning of the Directive.
The only point of concern has been the 500 EUR threshold, where some ask for clarifications; while others for its abolition.
Judgments of the Court of Justice Since 2001 and to the drafting this report, the Court of Justice has ruled on nine different occasions relative to Directive 85/374/EEC.
The Court of Justice offered some guidance on the concept of ‘damage’ in the case Veedfald (C-203/99); referred to some issues on the national measures of transposition in the cases against France (C-52/00), Greece (C-154/00) and Spain (C-183/00); idem in the case Skov Æg (C-402/03) and gave a definition of the concept ‘put into circulation’ in the case Declan O’Byrne (C-127/04).
Shifting or removing these founding principles such as causation – article 4, prescription periods – articles 10 %amp% 17, the development risk exemption – article 7, would mean that the interrelationships between these parties would upset this balance leading to adverse economic effects and diminishing the level of consumer protection.
In this sense, the Commission proposes the continuation during 2007 of the examination and discussion within the working groups, referred inter alia to the concepts mentioned in point 4 above (“Further work”) with the objective of analyzing the existing Community legal framework with regard to liability for defective products.
The Commission, in accordance with Article 21 of the Directive, must present periodic reports to the Council and the Parliament.
