DEFINITION 1.1.
ability to provide a dipped beam or a main beam or both. (2.) (3.) (4.) 5.
GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS 5.1.
Each sample shall conform to the specifications set forth in sections 6 and 7. 5.2.
The components by which the filament lamp is fixed to the reflector shall be so made that, even in darkness, the filament lamp can be fixed in no position but the correct one (1). 5.4.
The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be checked on a vertical screen set at a distance of 25 m in front of the headlamp and at right angles to its axis (see Appendices 1 and 2 to Annex V), and with a standard filament lamp designed for a nominal voltage of 12 V, having a smooth and colourless glass envelope and exhibiting the following characteristics at that voltage: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0009430%quot%%gt% The dimensions determining the position of the filaments inside the standard filament lamp are shown in the figure in Appendix 3 to Annex V.
The headlamp shall be so adjusted that: - in the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of right-hand traffic, the %quot%cut-off%quot% on the left half of the screen (1) is horizontal and in the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left-hand traffic, the %quot%cut-off%quot% on the right half of the screen is horizontal, - this horizontal part of the %quot%cut-off%quot% is situated on the screen 25 cm below the outline of the horizontal plane passing through the focus of the headlamp (see Appendices 1 and 2 to Annex V), - the screen is in the position indicated in Annex V, Appendices 1 and 2 (2).
Where a headlamp so adjusted does not meet the requirements referred to in 6.3 and 6.4, its adjustment may be changed, provided that the axis of the beam or the point of intersection H specified in Appendices 1 and 2 to Annex V is not laterally displaced by more than 1º (= 440 mm) to the right or left (4).
Such a headlamp need meet only the requirements of 6.4. 6.3.
The illumination produced on the screen by the dipped beam shall meet the following requirements: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0009431%quot%%gt% Where the flux of the standard filament lamp used for measurement is other than 450 lumens, the measurements as taken must be corrected in proportion to the values of the fluxes.
There shall be no lateral variation detrimental to good visibility in any of Zones I, II, III and IV. (1)The screen shall be sufficiently wide to allow examination of the %quot%cut-off%quot% over a range of at least 5º from the line vv (see Appendices 1 and 2 to Annex V). (2)If, in the case of a headlamp designed to satisfy the requirements of this Directive with respect to the dipped beam only, the focal axis diverges appreciably from the general direction of the beam, lateral adjustment shall be effected in the manner which best satisfies the requirements for illumination at points 75 and 50. (3)A %quot%dipped-beam%quot% headlamp of this kind may incorporate a main beam for which no specifications are laid down. (4)The limit of non-adjustment of 1º to the right or left is not incompatible with vertical non-adjustment.
The illumination produced on the screen by the main beam must satisfy the following requirements: the point of intersection H of the lines hh and vv shall be situated within the isolux corresponding to 90 % of maximum illumination.
This maximum value shall not be less than 32 lux; starting from point H, horizontally to the right and left, illumination shall be not less than 16 lux up to a distance of 1125 mm and not less than four lux up to a distance of 2250 mm.
Where the flux of the standard filament lamp used for measurements is other than 700 lumens, the measurements as taken shall be corrected in proportion to the values of the fluxes. 6.5.
The screen illumination values mentioned in 6.3 and 6.4 shall be measured by means of a photo-electric cell, the photo-sensitive area of which shall be contained within a square of side 65 mm. (7.) 8.
CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION Every headlamp bearing an EEC component type-approval mark shall conform to the approved type and comply with the photometric conditions specified in section 6. (9.) 10.

ANNEX VI EEC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL AND MARKING REQUIREMENTS 1.
an indication as to whether the lamp is intended to provide both a dipped beam and main beam or only one of these beams ; if the headlamp is intended to provide a dipped beam, whether it is designed for both left-hand and right-hand traffic or for either left-hand or right-hand traffic only; 1.2.1.2.
The drawings must indicate the position which the component type-approval mark, (particularly the type-approval number and the category reference[s] is to occupy in the type-approval mark rectangle; 1.2.1.4.
The drawings must indicate the position which the component type-approval mark (particularly the type-approval number and the category reference[s]) is to occupy in the type-approval mark rectangle; 1.2.2.3.
in the case of filament lamps with colourless glass envelopes - five samples ; in the case of filament lamps with coloured glass envelopes - one sample with a coloured glass envelope and five samples with colourless glass envelopes, the latter five differing from the former only in that the glass is not coloured.
Where the type of filament lamp concerned differs only in respect of colour from a colourless type which has previously satisfied the tests referred to in sections 4 to 8 of Annex III, it will be sufficient to submit one sample with a coloured glass envelope, and the only tests to be made on this sample will be those referred to in section 9 of Annex III. 2.

This space must correspond to the one shown in the drawings mentioned in 1.2.1.3. 2.1.3.
If all the samples submitted in accordance with section 1 meet the requirements of sections 5 and 6 of Annex I for headlamps and sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and II of Annex III for filament lamps, EEC component type-approval shall be granted and a component type-approval number assigned. 3.2.
Where a single EEC component type-approval number is issued for a type of lighting and light-signalling device comprising headlamps which function as main-beam and/or dipped-beam headlamps and other lamps, one EEC component type-approval mark only may be affixed, consisting of: - a rectangle sourrounding the letter %quot%e%quot% followed by the distinguishing letter(s) or number of the Member States which has granted the type-approval, - the EEC component type-approval number, - the additional symbols required by the various Directives under which EEC component type-approval was granted. 4.7.
