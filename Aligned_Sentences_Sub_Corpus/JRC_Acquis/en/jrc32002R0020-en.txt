Moreover, in view of the amendments made by Regulations (EC) Nos 1452/2001, 1453/2001 and 1454/2001 and of experience gained, in order to simplify the legislation, the three implementing Regulations should be recast in a single Regulation. (2) Detailed implementing rules should be laid down for drawing up and amending the forecast supply balances for products eligible under the specific supply arrangements. (3) Certain agricultural products which are exempt from import duties already require an import licence.
Applicants should be entitled to registration provided that they meet a certain number of objective requirements designed to facilitate administration of the scheme. (10) The detailed rules for administering the scheme must ensure that, for the quantities fixed in the forecast supply balance provided for in Regulations (EC) Nos 1452/2001, 1453/2001 and 1454/2001, registered traders obtain a licence or certificate for the products and quantities involved in the commercial transactions which they carry out on their own account, by presenting documents certifying that the operation is genuine and the application for a licence or certificate is in order. (11) Monitoring of operations qualifying under the scheme requires, inter alia, the period of validity of licences and certificates to be suited to the requirements of air or sea transport, proof to be furnished that the supply operation covered by the licence or certificate has been carried out in a short time-span, and the transfer of the rights and obligations conferred on the holder of the document in question to be prohibited. (12) The benefits granted in the form of exemption from import duties and aid for Community products must be passed on so that they are reflected in production costs and in the prices paid by the end users.
In particular, the quantities of processed products which may be the subject of traditional exports or consignments from the Canary Islands, the Azores and Madeira and of traditional consignments from the French overseas departments should be determined on the basis of the average of exports and consignments during 1989, 1990 and 1991, before the Poseican, Poseima and Poseidom arrangements entered into force, as established by the competent authorities.
