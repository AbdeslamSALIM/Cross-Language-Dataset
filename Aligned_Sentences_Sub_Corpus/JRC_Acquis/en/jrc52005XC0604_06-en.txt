The company was established in September 2002, when 12 executives from Compagnie Générale des Moteurs Electriques (CGME), a former Moulinex subsidiary, took over their company's assets.
The only information supplied by the French authorities consists of sales forecasts for 2005 and 2006, but this is insufficient to establish the company's viability.
Moreover, the competitive situation and the prospects for the markets in motors for household appliances (on which Euromoteurs produces 25 % of European consumption) and motor seats (on which the company plans to produce 10 % of European consumption in 2006) are an unknown factor.
Lastly, according to the information given to the Commission, Euromoteurs could have been exempted from business and property taxes during its first two years of operation under Article 44 septies of the General Tax Code.
TEXT OF LETTER Par la présente, la Commission a l'honneur d'informer la France qu'après avoir examiné les informations fournies par vos autorités sur la mesure citée en objet, elle a décidé d'ouvrir la procédure prévue à l'article 88, paragraphe 2, du traité CE. 1.
Tous les intéressés susmentionnés seront invités à présenter leurs observations dans le délai d'un mois à compter de la date de cette publication. [1] OJ C 288, 9.10.1999, p. 2. [2] OJ L 108, 16.4.2004, p. 38. --------------------------------------------------
