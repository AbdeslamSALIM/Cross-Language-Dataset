The rates of the countervailing duties ranged between 3,8 and 19,1 %. (2) Imports of PET film originating in India are also subject to anti-dumping duties, ranging between 0 and 62,6 %, imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1676/2001 [3]. 2.
ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS (3) On 28 June 2002, the Commission announced by a notice of initiation published in the Official Journal of the European Communities [4], the initiation of a partial interim review pursuant to Article 19 of the basic Regulation.
This review is still ongoing. (4) On 22 November 2003, the Commission announced by a notice of initiation published in the Official Journal of the European Union [5], the initiation of a partial interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 [6], limited in scope to the form of the anti-dumping measures.
This review is still ongoing. (5) On 19 February 2004, the Commission announced by a notice of initiation published in the Official Journal of the European Union [7], the initiation of a partial interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 limited to dumping for the Indian exporting producer Jindal Polyester Limited.
REQUEST (6) On 6 January 2004, the Commission received a request pursuant to Article 23(2) of the basic Regulation (the request) from the Community producers DuPont Teijin Films, Mitsubishi Polyester Film GmbH and Nuroll SpA (the applicants) to investigate the alleged circumvention of the countervailing measures imposed on imports of PET film originating in India.
The applicants represent a major proportion of the Community production of PET film. (7) The applicants alleged and submitted sufficient evidence showing that, following the imposition of measures on imports of PET film originating in India, there had been significant changes in the patterns of trade involving exports of PET film from India, Brazil and Israel to the Community.
It was claimed that significant volumes of imports of PET film from Brazil and Israel appear to have replaced imports of PET film originating in India.
In addition, the applicant submitted prima facie evidence that PET film originating in India continues to benefit from subsidies found to be countervailable in the original investigation. 4.
INITIATION (9) By Regulation (EC) No 283/2004 [8] (the initiating Regulation), the Commission initiated an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of countervailing measures on imports of PET film originating in India by imports of PET film consigned from Brazil and from Israel, whether declared as originating in Brazil or Israel or not and, pursuant to Article 23(2) and Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation, directed the customs authorities to register imports of PET film consigned from Brazil and from Israel, whether declared as originating in Brazil or Israel or not, as of 20 February 2004.
At the same time, by Regulation (EC) No 284/2004 [9], the Commission also initiated an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures on imports of PET film originating in India by imports of PET film consigned from Brazil and from Israel, whether declared as originating in Brazil or Israel or not.
The findings of that investigation are presented in Council Regulation (EC) No 1975/2004 [10]. (10) The Indian authorities indicated that they considered that anti-circumvention investigations were not permissible under either the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 or the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.
All parties were informed that non-cooperation might lead to the application of Article 28 of the basic Regulation and to findings which, being made on the basis of the facts available, can be less favourable than if the party had cooperated. (12) Replies to the questionnaire were received from six exporters/producers in India from one exporter/producer in Brazil and from one processing company involved in slitting, sheeting and converting PET film in Israel and exporting PET film to the Community.
The other two importers stated that they had not imported Indian PET film from Brazil or from Israel during the investigation period.
INVESTIGATION PERIOD (15) The investigation period covered the period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003 (the IP).
DEGREE OF COOPERATION (16) As stated in recital 12, six exporters/producers of PET film in India cooperated with the investigation by submitting questionnaire replies.
Information was also obtained from one exporting producer of PET film in Brazil and from one processing company slitting, sheeting and converting PET film in Israel.
These Brazilian and Israeli companies accounted for a minor part (less than 1 % and around 5 %, respectively) both in volume and in value, of the total imports of PET film from those countries to the Community during the IP as reported by Eurostat. (17) The Indian authorities made a written submission further to the initiation of the investigation and provided statistical information concerning exports of PET film from India to, inter alia, the Community.
CHANGE IN THE PATTERN OF TRADE India (20) Over the period 1999 to 2003, imports of the product concerned represented 96,5 % of total imports from India under the relevant CN codes.
In 1999 countervailing duties were imposed on imports to the Community of PET film originating in India, prompting a decrease in volumes of such imports from 11700 tonnes in 1998 to 10600 tonnes in 1999.
Since then imports gradually recovered and stood at 11500 tonnes during the IP. (21) In respect of the above pattern it is noted that one company had a significantly lower cumulative duty [12] rate than the other producers.
Notably, between 2000 and 2001, when anti-dumping measures were introduced, this company massively increased its share of all Indian exports to the Community.
Discounting this irregular trend, the total volume of the product concerned imported into the Community remained well below that prior to the imposition of countervailing measures. (22) The Indian authorities submitted statistical data on exports to, inter alia, the Community.
As far as Brazil is concerned, Indian export data for direct exports to Brazil shows an increase from around 460 tonnes in 1998 to over 1500 tonnes in 2000 and then relative stability at this level.
Indeed, the only known Brazilian producer of PET film cooperated in the investigation and its exports to the Community only represent a negligible part (0,5 %) of all sales to the Community from Brazil during the IP.
The company does not therefore appear to be responsible for the volumes of PET film entering the Community from Brazil in the period 1998 to 2003 (recital 23 above).
Israel (25) Imports into the Community of PET film from Israel as reported by Eurostat at CN level, less the imports of goods produced by the cooperating company, declined between 1998 and 1999 from 1100 tonnes to just under 1000 tonnes in 1999 (1,3 % of total PET film imports) but then increased to 3000 tonnes in 2000 (3,7 % of total imports) and to 3400 tonnes in 2001 (4,1 % of total PET film imports).
Volumes continued to rise to just over 4200 tonnes in 2002 (5,1 % of imports) and to over 4400 tonnes in 2003 (5,3 % of imports).
The quantities of PET film exported by Jolybar to the Community doubled between 1999 and 2003 (the IP).
Irrespective as to whether this development of exports indicates a change in the company's pattern of trade this issue was not considered further as there was, in any event, a clear economic justification for this behaviour as set out in recital 31. (28) In view of the above, and in particular given the coincidence between the rise of imports from Brazil and Israel and the entry into force in 1999, of the countervailing measures on PET film originating in India, a change in the pattern of trade is established in respect of exports of PET film from India, Israel and Brazil. 4.
Israel Non-cooperating exporting producers (30) In the absence of cooperation and given that the abovementioned change in the pattern of trade took place following the imposition of countervailing duties it has to be concluded, on the basis of the information available and in the absence of any other explanation, that the change in the pattern of trade stemmed from the imposition of the duty rather than from any other sufficient due cause or economic justification within the meaning of Article 23(1) of the basic Regulation.
It is therefore concluded that there is sufficient economic justification for the development of Jolybarâ€™s exports, which is in line with its activities in the Community market in respect of PET film manufactured by them. 5.
UNDERMINING OF THE REMEDIAL EFFECTS OF THE DUTY IN TERMS OF THE PRICES AND/OR THE QUANTITIES OF THE LIKE PRODUCT Non-cooperating exporting producers (32) The figures in recitals 20 to 28 indicate that a clear quantitative change in the pattern of Community imports of the product concerned occurred since the imposition of measures in 1999.
There was a decrease in Indian imports to the Community at the time of the imposition of the measures, from 11700 tonnes in 1998 to 10600 tonnes in 1999 (9 %).
Eurostat data indicate that, from 1998 until the end of IP, the increases in imports to the Community amounted to 1900 tonnes from Brazil and 3500 tonnes from Israel.
It is therefore considered that part of the export trade flows from India have been first compensated, and later supplemented, by export flows through Brazil and Israel thus undermining the remedial effects of the measures in terms of the quantities imported into the Community market. (33) With regard to prices of the product concerned consigned from Brazil and from Israel, in view of the low cooperation, it was necessary to refer to Eurostat data, which was the best evidence available. (34) The average price of imports of PET film from Brazil during the IP, adjusted for post-import costs, was around 67 % of the injury elimination level established in the investigation which led to the imposition of countervailing measures.
On this basis, there is evidence that PET films consigned from Brazil also undermined the remedial effects of the duty imposed in terms of prices. (35) The average price of imports of PET film from Israel during the IP, adjusted for post-import costs, was around 75 % of the injury elimination level established in the original anti-subsidy investigation.
On this basis, there is evidence that the Israeli imports also undermined the remedial effects of the duty imposed in terms of prices. (36) It is therefore concluded that the imports of PET film from Brazil and from Israel undermined the remedial effects of the countervailing measures both in terms of quantities and prices. 6.
As stated in recitals 24 and 27, these companies cooperated in the investigation, by submitting a questionnaire reply and accepting a verification visit. (39) By Regulation (EC) No 1830/2004 [13], the Commission amended the initiating Regulation in order to cease registration of imports of PET film from Terphane and Jolybar which were found not to be circumventing the countervailing duties. (40) In accordance with the above findings that Terphane and Jolybar were found not to have circumvented the countervailing measures in force, these companies should also be exempted from the extension of the measures envisaged.
The definitive countervailing duty of 19,1 % imposed by Regulation (EC) No 2597/1999 on imports of polyethylene terephthalate film originating in India, falling within CN codes ex39206219 and ex39206290, is hereby extended to imports of the same polyethylene terephthalate film consigned from Brazil and consigned from Israel (whether declared as originating in Brazil or Israel or not) (TARIC codes 3920621901, 3920621904, 3920621907, 3920621911, 3920621914, 3920621917, 3920621921, 3920621924, 3920621927, 3920621931, 3920621934, 3920621937, 3920621941, 3920621944, 3920621947, 3920621951, 3920621954, 3920621957, 3920621961, 3920621967, 3920621974, 3920621992, 3920629031, 3920629092) with the exception of those produced by Terphane Ltda BR 101, km 101, City of Cabo de Santo Agostinho, State of Pernambuco, Brazil (TARIC additional code A569) and by Jolybar Filmtechnic Converting Ltd (1987), Hacharutsim str. 7, Ind.
