At its 425th plenary session, held on 15- 16 March 2006 (meeting of 16 March), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 141 votes to 1 with 5 abstentions. 1.
Introduction: Gist of the proposal 2.1 With this proposal (COM(2005) 229 final), the Commission intends to follow up the eEurope 2005 Action Plan [1], which was the successor of the eEurope 2002 [2] Action Plan.
For this reason, the ESC agrees with those who support the view that the programme as a whole and the individual measures should include means of combating these risks" [8]. 3.2 These and other [9] observations by the EESC, in conjunction with the Final Report and other Commission documents on the eEurope 2002 programme, have led the Committee to the following conclusions on the Commission communication on "i2010 â€” A European Information Society for growth and employment". 3.3 The EESC welcomes the European Commission's communication on i2010 as an essential exercise to frame the future strategy for the Information Society in the EU. 3.4 The EESC supports the Commission's intention to continue and enhance the eEurope initiative beyond 2005. 3.5 Over the last decade Europe has made much progress in exploiting new information technology, both in terms of IT uptake and maintaining a strong IT and telecoms industry.
The EESC would refer to earlier experiences with, for example, the GSM standard, and the IP-protocol. 4.6 The move towards more integrated IP-based networks both in business as well as in the public sector, will have far-reaching implications for the interplay between stakeholders: enterprises, public authorities and citizens.
The EESC believes it is essential for the European information society that EU and national policy-makers ensure the appropriate climate for these major investments. 4.7 In the information society debate, security is central to the development of attitudes towards and trust in IT.
The EESC believes that a common environment should be created through the Agency where public and private sectors can work together to protect their information systems, taking into account the increasingly rapid changes in technology and without imposing inappropriate administrative or financial burdens. 4.7.5 The EESC believes that enhancing awareness is fundamental to increasing information and network security.
The EESC shares this analysis. 4.12 The EESC believes that one of the central pillars in ICT-policy is public authorities' use of ICT in a broad sense.
