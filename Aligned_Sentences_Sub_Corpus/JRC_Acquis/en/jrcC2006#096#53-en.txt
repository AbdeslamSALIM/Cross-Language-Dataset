Case F-119/05: Action brought on 13 December 2005 — Gesner v OHIM Action brought on 13 December 2005 — Gesner v OHIM Parties Applicant: Charlotte Gesner (Kildedalsvej, Denmark) (represented by: J.
Vazquez Vazquez and C.
Amo Quiñones, lawyers) Defendant: Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market Form of order sought The applicant claims that the Court should: - order that the decision adopted by the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) of 2 September 2005 be annulled, to the extent that it dismisses the applicant's complaint of 10 May 2005 against its decision of 21 April 2005 refusing to appoint an invalidity committee. - order the defendant to pay the costs.
First, Article 59 of the Staff Regulations should be interpreted as meaning that the decision to convene an invalidity committee is a matter for the appointing authority.
Second, since the applicant has been on sick leave for only 294 days in the last three years she has not completed the period prescribed in Article 59(4) of the Staff Regulations.
In her third plea the applicant claims that the provisions applicable to the appointment of an invalidity committee need not be limited to Article 59 of the Staff Regulations, but include provisions which fall within the legal framework governing access to invalidity allowances, namely Articles 31 to 33 of the Conditions of Employment for Other Servants of the European Communities, Article 9 of the Staff Regulations, and Annex VIII thereto.
