ANNEX TECHNICAL FORMAT 1.
In order to be precise about the nature of the data, it is necessary to distinguish the following special cases: - data equal to zero (coded "0"): real values of zero only, - confidential data (coded "x"): indicates data which the Member State does not transmit to Eurostat because the data is confidential, - missing data (coded "m"): this is data which is currently missing but the Member State intends to supply when available, - data not available: this is data which is not collected in a Member State.
This is why it is important to distinguish data which is really missing by supplying a record (one per missing item) in which the data value is coded as "m", and data which is really equal to zero by supplying the corresponding records in which the data value is set to 0. 2.
