Individual anti-dumping duty rates ranging from 7,6 % to 39,9 % were imposed on co-operating exporting producers in the PRC.
This request was submitted by four major Community producers of hand pallet trucks and essential parts thereof (BT Products AB, Franz Kahl GmbH, Bolzoni Auramo SpA and Pramac Lifter S.p.A) representing a major proportion, in this case more than 70 %, of the total Community production (%quot%the applicants%quot%). (3) The applicants submitted sufficient prima facie information showing that the anti-dumping duty imposed on hand pallet trucks and essential parts thereof originating in the PRC has not led to any movement or sufficient movement in resale prices or subsequent selling prices in the Community, suggesting an increase in dumping and thus impeding the intended remedial effects of the anti-dumping measures in force. 3.

Therefore, no recourse to facts available in the meaning of Article 18 of the basic Regulation concerning non co-operating exporting producers was made. 4.
