The comitology committees share three essential features.
The committees intervene within the framework of the procedures set out in the basic legislative instrument, in compliance with the Council’s comitology decision.
In order to complete the update, at the end of 2001 the Commission presented a package of four proposals (the so-called “alignment regulations” ),[5] covering more than 300 basic instruments laying down implementing procedures.
On 22 April 2004, the Commission issued an amended proposal[16] to take on board the bulk of the European Parliament’s amendment, and clarify the new procedure.
The amended proposal is currently under examination in the Council.
For part of the year 2003, the 1987 comitology procedures continued to apply until the entry into force of the “alignment regulations” (see Section 1.2 above).
The total number of opinions delivered by the committees in 2003 was 2.981 (compared to 3.610 in 2002); the number of instruments adopted by the Commission was 2.768 (compared to 3.077 in 2002).
