Proposal for a Council Decision on the position to be taken by the Community concerning the proposal to amend the International Convention on the Harmonisation of Frontier Controls of Goods 1982 /* COM/2005/0138 final - ACC 2005/0053 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 14.4.2005 COM(2005) 138 final 2005/0053 (ACC) Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION on the position to be taken by the Community concerning the proposal to amend the International Convention on the Harmonisation of Frontier Controls of Goods 1982 (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
The draft annex essentially contains obligations that aim at reducing delays at border crossing points in respect of live animals and perishable goods (through, by example, the use of "one stop" technology to enable joint controls between neighbouring countries 24 hours a day, and the separation of traffic flows to give priority to the movement of these goods), improving the operation of border crossing points, as well as technical matters relating to the mutual recognition of international vehicle inspection and weight certificates. 5.

Article 4 Vehicle inspection 1.
The Technical Inspection Certificate, as contained in the Agreement as of 1 January 2002, is contained in Appendix 1 to this Annex. 2.
Article 5 International Vehicle Weight Certificate 1.
In order to accelerate border crossings, the Contracting Parties, in line with relevant national and international laws and regulations, should endeavour to avoid repetitive vehicle weighing procedures at border crossings by accepting and mutually recognizing the International Vehicle Weight Certificate as contained in Appendix 2 to this Annex.
The minimum requirements for authorized weighing stations, the principles of authorization and the basic features of weighing procedures to be applied are contained in Appendix 2 to this Annex.
Article 6 Border crossing points In order to ensure that the required formalities at border crossing points are streamlined and accelerated, the Contracting Parties shall meet, as far as possible, the following minimum requirements for border crossing points open for international goods traffic: (i) facilities enabling joint controls between neighbouring States (one-stop technology), 24 hours a day, whenever justified by trade needs and in line with road traffic regulations; (ii) separation of traffic for different types of traffic on both sides of the border allowing to give preference to vehicles under the cover of valid international Customs transit documents (TIR, T) or carrying live animals or perishable foodstuffs; (iii) off-lane control areas for random cargo and vehicle checks; (iv) appropriate parking and terminal facilities; (v) proper hygiene, social and telecommunications facilities for drivers; (vi) assistance in the establishment of forwarding agents at border crossings with adequate facilities, offering services to transport operators on a competitive basis.

For the purposes of this certificate, approved weighing stations shall be equipped with weighing instruments corresponding to either: - OIML Recommendation R 76 “Non-automatic weighing instruments” accuracy class III or better; or - OIML Draft Recommendation “Automatic instruments for weighing road vehicles in motion”, accuracy classes 0.5, 1, 2, or better, resulting in maximum permissible errors of ± 2%, 1% and 0.5% or less.
Higher error values may apply in case of individual axle weight measurements.
As a consequence, fines shall not be imposed on transport operators utilizing this certificate unless the weight measurement(s) inscribed in this certificate minus the maximum possible weighing error (i.e. 2 per cent maximum or 800 kg in case of a 40 tonne vehicle) exceed(s) the maximum permissible weight(s) as prescribed by the national legislation. | ATTACHMENT to the INTERNATIONAL VEHICLE WEIGHT CERTIFICATE (IVWC) Sketches of types of goods road vehicles as required under item 7.1 of the IVWC | No. | Goods road vehicles | Vehicle Type * means first alternative axle configuration ** means second alternative axle configuration | Distance between axles (m)¹ ¹ No specification is given if not relevant | I.
