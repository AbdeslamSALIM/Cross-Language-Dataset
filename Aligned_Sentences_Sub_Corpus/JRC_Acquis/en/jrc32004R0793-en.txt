The analysis shall be communicated to the Commission at the same time." (d) Paragraph 4 shall be replaced by the following paragraphs: "4.
All schedules facilitators and coordinators shall cooperate to detect inconsistencies in schedules." (c) The present paragraph 7 shall become paragraph 8 and the introductory wording shall be replaced by the following: "The coordinator shall on request and within a reasonable time make available free of charge for review to interested parties, in particular to members or observers of the coordination committee, either in written form or in any other easily accessible form, the following information:" (d) The present paragraph 8 shall become paragraph 9 and shall be replaced by the following: "9.
The information referred to in paragraph 8 shall be made available at the latest at the time of the relevant scheduling conferences and as appropriate during the conferences and thereafter.
The tasks of the coordination committee shall be: - the possibilities for increasing the capacity of the airport determined in accordance with Article 3 or for improving its usage; - the coordination parameters to be determined in accordance with Article 6; - the methods of monitoring the use of allocated slots; - local guidelines for the allocation of slots or the monitoring of the use of allocated slots, taking into account, inter alia, possible environmental concerns, as provided for in Article 8(5); - improvements to traffic conditions prevailing at the airport in question; - serious problems encountered by new entrants, as provided for in Article 10(9); - all questions relating to the capacity of the airport; (b) to mediate between all parties concerned on complaints on the allocation of slots, as provided for in Article 11. 2.

Re-timing of series of slots before the allocation of the remaining slots from the pool referred to in Article 10 to the other applicant air carriers shall be accepted only for operational reasons or if slot timings of applicant air carriers would be improved in relation to the timings initially requested.
Where public service obligations have been imposed on a route in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92, a Member State may reserve at a coordinated airport the slots required for the operations envisaged on that route.
A series of slots that has been allocated to an air carrier for the operation of a scheduled or a programmed non-scheduled air service shall not entitle that air carrier to the same series of slots in the next equivalent scheduling period if the air carrier cannot demonstrate to the satisfaction of the coordinator that they have been operated, as cleared by the coordinator, by that air carrier for at least 80 % of the time during the scheduling period for which they have been allocated. 3.

Air carriers that repeatedly and intentionally operate air services at a time significantly different from the allocated slot as part of a series of slots or uses slots in a significantly different way from that indicated at the time of allocation and thereby cause prejudice to airport or air traffic operations shall lose their status as referred to in Article 8(2).
