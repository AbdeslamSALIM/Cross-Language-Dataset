Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to Directive 71/127/EEC. (2) Existing provisions, in particular in the case of categories N2, N3, M2 and M3 have proved inadequate as regards the exterior field of vision to the side, front and rear of the vehicle.
With effect from 26 January 2010 for vehicles of categories M1 and N1, and with effect from 26 January 2007 for all vehicles of other categories, Member States: - shall consider certificates of conformity which accompany new vehicles in accordance with the provisions of Directive 70/156/EEC to be no longer valid for the purposes of Article 7(1) of that Directive, - shall prohibit the sale, registration or entry into service of vehicles, on grounds relating to the device for indirect vision if the vehicles do not comply with the requirements of this Directive. 5.
Notwithstanding paragraph 3, Member States may continue to grant national type-approval for any new type of articulated vehicle of category M2 and M3, class I, as defined in Annex I, point 2.1.1.1 to Directive 2001/85/EC(6), composed of at least three articulated rigid parts, which do not comply with the provisions of this Directive, provided that the requirements for the driver's field of vision are respected as referred in Annex III, point 5 to this Directive. 8.
Therefore, as soon as possible after the adoption of this Directive, the Commission shall submit a proposal to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe with the aim of aligning the provisions of UNECE Regulation 46 with the provisions of this Directive.
Article 3 By 26 January 2010, the Commission shall carry out a detailed study to ascertain whether the amendments introduced by this Directive are having a positive effect on road safety, in particular as regards pedestrians, cyclists and other vulnerable road users.
Article 6 Directive 71/127/EEC shall be repealed with effect from 24 January 2010.
Article 7 This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 8 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

General specifications 1.1.
The edge of the reflecting surface must be enclosed in a protective housing (holder, etc.) which, on its perimeter, must have a value %quot%c%quot% greater than or equal to 2,5 mm at all points and in all directions.
If the reflecting surface projects beyond the protective housing, the radius of curvature %quot%c%quot% on the edge of the projecting part must be not less than 2,5 mm and the reflecting surface must return into the protective housing under a force of 50 N applied to the point of greatest projection, relative to the protective housing, in a horizontal direction, approximately parallel to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle. 1.3.
When the mirror is mounted on a plane surface, all parts, irrespective of the adjustment position of the device, including those parts remaining attached to the support after the test provided for in point 4.2, which are in potential, static contact with a sphere either 165 mm in diameter in the case of an interior mirror or 100 mm in diameter in the case of an exterior mirror, must have a radius of curvature %quot%c%quot% of not less than 2,5 mm. 1.3.1.
The device for the attachment of mirrors to the vehicle must be so designed that a cylinder with a 70 mm radius, having as its axis the axis, or one of the axes, of pivot or rotation which ensures deflection of the mirror in the direction of impact concerned, passes through at least part of the surface to which the device is attached. 1.5.
The parts of exterior mirrors referred to in points 1.2 and 1.3 which are made of a material with a Shore A hardness not exceeding 60 are exempt from the relevant provisions. 1.6.
In the case of those parts of interior mirrors which are made of a material with a Shore A hardness of less than 50 and which are mounted on a rigid support, the requirements of points 1.2 and 1.3 shall only apply to the support. 2.
Interior rear-view mirrors (Class I) The dimensions of the reflecting surface must be such that it is possible to inscribe thereon a rectangle one side of which is 40 mm and the other %quot%a%quot% mm in length, where %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.002102.TIF%quot%%gt% and r is the radius of curvature. 2.2.
Main exterior rear-view mirrors (Classes II and III) 2.2.1.
The dimensions of the reflecting surface must be such that it is possible to inscribe therein: - a rectangle 40 mm high the base length of which, measured in millimetres, has the value %quot%a%quot%; - a segment which is parallel to the height of the rectangle and the length of which, expressed in millimetres, has the value %quot%b%quot%. 2.2.2.
Front mirrors (Class VI) The contours of the reflecting surface must be of simple geometric form and its dimensions such that the mirror provides the field of vision specified in point 5.6 of Annex III. 3.
The difference between any of the radii of curvature (rp1, rp2, and rp3) and r must not exceed 0,15 r. 3.2.3.
When r is not less than 3000 mm, the value of 0,15 r quoted in points 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 is replaced by 0,25 r. 3.3.
The radius of curvature ri of the aspherical part shall not be less than 150 mm. 3.4.

The reflecting surface must retain the characteristics laid down in point 3.5 in spite of prolonged exposure to adverse weather conditions in normal use. 4.
Mirrors shall be subjected to the tests described in point 4.2. 4.1.1.
The test provided for in point 4.2 shall not be required in the case of any exterior mirror of which no part is less than 2 m from the ground, regardless of the adjustment position, when the vehicle is under a load corresponding to its maximum technically permissible mass.
This derogation also applies to the attachments of mirrors (attachment plates, arms, swivel joints, etc.) which are situated less than 2 m from the ground and which do not project beyond the overall width of the vehicle, measured in the transverse plane passing through the lowest mirror attachments or any other point forward of this plane if this configuration produces a greater overall width.
Impact test The test according to this paragraph is not to be carried out for devices integrated in the bodywork of the vehicle and providing a frontal deflecting area of an angle not more than 45 ° measured in relation to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle, or devices not protruding more than 100 mm measured beyond the circumscribing bodywork of the vehicle according to 74/483/EEC. 4.2.1.
Description of the test rig 4.2.1.1.
The end of the pendulum comprises a hammer formed by a rigid sphere with a diameter of 165 ± 1 mm having a 5 mm thick rubber covering of Shore A hardness 50.
Figure 2 gives the dimensions of the test rig and the special design specifications: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.002401.TIF%quot%%gt% 4.2.1.2.
It is at a distance %quot%l%quot% from the axis of oscillation in the release plane, which is equal to 1 m ± 5 mm.
Description of the test 4.2.2.1.
When the mirror has a device for adjusting its distance from the base, the device must be set in the position in which the distance between the housing and the base is shortest. 4.2.2.2.4.
The longitudinal direction of oscillation of the pendulum shall be parallel to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle. 4.2.2.4.
The test consists in allowing the hammer to fall from a height corresponding to a pendulum angle of 60 ° from the vertical so that the hammer strikes the mirror at the moment when the pendulum reaches the vertical position. 4.2.2.6.
The impact must occur on the reflecting surface side. 4.2.2.6.2.
Nevertheless, the technical service responsible for testing may repeat one or both of these tests on the upper mirror if this is less than 2 m from the ground. 5.
The required angle to the vertical is reduced from 20 ° to 10 ° for all Class II and Class IV rear-view mirrors and for Class III rear-view mirrors which are attached to the same mounting as Class IV mirrors. 5.2.
Should the mounting of the mirror break during the tests described in point 4.2 for mirrors stuck to the windscreen, the part remaining must not project beyond the base by more than 10 mm and the configuration remaining after the test must satisfy the conditions laid down in point 1.3. 5.3.
The reflecting surface must not break during the tests described in point 4.2.
DEVICES FOR INDIRECT VISION OTHER THAN MIRRORS 1.
General requirements 1.1.
General requirements 2.1.1.
When the camera-monitor device for indirect vision is mounted on a plane surface, all parts, irrespective of the adjustment position of the device which are in potential, static contact with a sphere either 165 mm in diameter in the case of a monitor or 100 mm in diameter in the case of a camera, must have a radius of curvature %quot%c%quot% of not less than 2,5 mm. 2.1.2.
For parts of the camera and the monitor which are made of a material with a Shore A hardness of less than 60 and which are mounted on a rigid support, the requirements of point 2.1.1 shall only apply to the support. 2.2.
Functional requirements 2.2.1.
The camera shall provide a luminance contrast of at least 1:3 under low sun condition in a region outside the part of the image where the light source is reproduced (condition as defined in EN 12368:8.4).
The angle between the normal of the sensor plane and the line connecting the midpoint of the sensor and the light source shall be 10 °. 2.2.2.
The monitor shall render a minimum contrast under various light conditions as specified by draft international standard ISO/DIS 15008 [2]. 2.2.3.
The measurements for the luminance contrast shall be carried out according to ISO/DIS 15008. 3.
Appendix 1 Procedure for determining the radius of curvature %quot%r%quot% of the reflecting surface of a mirror 1.
Equipment A %quot%spherometer%quot% similar to the one described in Figure 3 having the indicated distances between the tracing pin of the dial gauge and the fixed legs of the bar is used. 1.2.
Measuring points 1.2.1.
The principal radii of curvature shall be measured at three points situated as close as possible to positions at one-third, one-half and two-thirds of the distance along the arc of the reflecting surface passing through the centre of this surface and parallel to segment b, or of the arc passing through the centre of the reflecting surface which is perpendicular to it if this arc is the longer. 1.2.2.
Where, owing to the size of the reflecting surface, it is impossible to obtain measurements in the directions defined in point 1.1.1.5 of Annex I, the technical services responsible for the tests may take measurements at the said point in two perpendicular directions as close as possible to those prescribed above. 2.
Calculation of the radius of curvature %quot%r%quot% %quot%r%quot% expressed in mm is calculated from the formula: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.002802.TIF%quot%%gt% where: rp1: the radius of curvature at the first measuring point, rp2: the radius of curvature at the second measuring point, rp3: the radius of curvature at the third measuring point.

DEFINITIONS 1.1.
CIE standard illuminate A(1): Colorimetric illuminate, respecting the full radiator at T68 = 2855,6 K. 1.2.
CIE standard source A(2): Gas-filled tungsten filament lamp operating at a correlated colour temperature of T68= 2855,6 K. 1.3.
CIE 1931 standard colorimetric observer(3): Receptor of radiation whose colorimetric characteristics correspond to the spectral tristimulus values %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.002902.TIF%quot%%gt% (λ), %amp%gt;PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.002903.TIF%quot%%amp%gt; (λ), %amp%gt;PIC FILE= %quot%L_2004025EN.002904.TIF%quot%%amp%gt; (λ) (see table). 1.4.
Photopic vision(5): Vision by the normal eye when it is adapted to levels of luminance of at least several cd/m2. 2.
The receiver may incorporate a light-integrating sphere to facilitate measuring the reflectance of non-flat (convex) mirrors (see Figure 5). 2.2.
The receiver shall have a photodetector with a spectral response proportional to the photopic luminosity function of the CIE (1931) standard colorimetric observer (see table).
Geometrical conditions The angle of the incident beam (θ) should preferably be 0,44 ± 0,09 rad (25 ± 5 °) from the perpendicular to the test surface and shall not exceed the upper limit of the tolerance (i.e. 0,53 rad or 30 °).
The reflected beam shall not be wider than the sensitive area of the photodetector, shall not cover less than 50 % of such area, and as nearly as possible shall cover the same area segment as used during instrument calibration.

The provisions for front mirrors are compulsory for forward-controlled (as defined in Directive 70/156/EEC, Annex I(a), footnote (Z)) vehicles of categories N2 %amp%gt; 7,5 t and N3.
This device must be able to detect an object of 50 cm height and with a diameter of 30 cm within the field defined in Figure 11.

However, if the driver can see, taking into account the obstructions by the A-pillars, a straight line 300 mm in front of the vehicle at a height of 1200 mm above the road surface and which is situated between a longitudinal vertical plane parallel to the longitudinal vertical median plane going through the outermost side of the vehicle at the driver's side and a longitudinal vertical plane parallel to the longitudinal vertical median plane 900 mm outside the outermost side of the vehicle opposite to the driver's side, a front mirror of class VI is not mandatory. 5.7.
Interior rear-view mirror (Class I) The field of vision may be reduced by the presence of headrest and devices such as, in particular, sun visors, rear windscreen wipers, heating elements and stop lamp of category S3 or by components of bodywork such as window columns of rear split doors, provided that all these devices together do not obscure more than 15 per cent of the prescribed field of vision when projected onto a vertical plane perpendicular to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle.
Exterior mirrors (Classes II, III, IV, V and VI) In the fields of vision specified above, obstruction due to the bodywork and some of its components, such as other mirrors, door handles, outline marker lights, direction indicators and rear bumpers, as well as reflective-surface cleaning components, shall not be taken into account if they are responsible for a total obstruction of less than 10 % of the specified field of vision. 5.9.
Devices for indirect vision other than mirrors 6.
Installation requirements for the monitor The viewing direction of the monitor shall roughly be the same direction as the one for the main mirror. 10.
Vehicles of category M2 and M3 and complete or completed vehicles of categories N2 %amp%gt;7,5 t and N3 having a special bodywork for refuse collection may be equipped on the rear part of their bodywork with a device for indirect vision other than a mirror in order to ensure the following field of vision. 10.1.
The field of vision (see figure 12) must be such that the driver can see at least a flat horizontal portion of the road, which is bounded by: - a vertical plane aligned on the furthest rear point of the complete vehicle and perpendicular to the longitudinal vertical median plane of the vehicle; - a vertical plane which is parallel to and positioned 2000 mm to the rear of the previous plane (with respect to the rear of the vehicle); - two longitudinal vertical planes defined at the outermost sides of the vehicle and which are parallel to the longitudinal vertical median plane of the vehicle. 10.2.
If vehicles of these categories cannot fulfil the requirements of point 10.1 by using a camera/monitor device, other devices for indirect vision can be used.
In this case the device must be able to detect an object of 50 cm height and with a diameter of 30 cm within the field defined in point 10.1.
