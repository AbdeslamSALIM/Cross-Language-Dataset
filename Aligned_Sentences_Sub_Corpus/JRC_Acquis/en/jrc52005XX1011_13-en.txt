Notification by Greece concerning visa reciprocity Notification by Greece concerning visa reciprocity [1] (2005/C 251/13) Sir, Following the entry into force of Council Regulation (EC) No 851/2005, which amends Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 and establishes a reciprocity mechanism for cases where third countries unilaterally impose a visa requirement on Community citizens, and pursuant to Article 2 of that Regulation, we wish to inform the Council of the European Union of the continuing unfavourable and discriminatory treatment of Greek citizens by the following countries as regards visas: - United States of America: unilaterally imposes a visa requirement on Greek citizens. - Australia: requires all Community citizens (and consequently also Greek citizens), before their entry into the country, to hold an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) "quasi visa", which is the equivalent of a visa.
