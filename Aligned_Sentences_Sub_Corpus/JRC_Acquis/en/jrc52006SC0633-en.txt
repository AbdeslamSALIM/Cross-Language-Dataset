European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders 7 3.
Section VIII part B (European Data-protection Supervisor) 8 SUMMARY TABLE BY HEADING OF THE FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVES 9 GENERAL STATEMENT OF REVENUE STATEMENT OF REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE BY SECTION The general statement of revenue and the statement of revenue and expenditure by section are forwarded separately via the SEI-BUD system.
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
European GNSS Supervisory Authority The European GNSS Supervisory Authority was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 of 12 July 2004[2]on the establishment of structures for the management of the European satellite radionavigation programmes.
The tasks of the Supervisory Authority are laid down in Article 2 of Regulation No 1321/2004.
The Galileo Joint Undertaking was set up to implement the development phase, and its lifetime is based on the duration of that phase, which was initially intended to cover the years 2002 to 2005 inclusive, but has since been extended to 2008.
It should be noted that the Supervisory Authority’s 2006 Budget, as presented by the Commission in the 2006 Preliminary Draft Budget, could not reflect this situation for objective and, in particular, legal reasons.
The proposed preliminary draft amending budget is based on an estimated staff for 2006 of 39 (11 recruited in 2005, 9 in the first quarter of 2006 and 19 on adoption of the amending budget by the budgetary authority).
This evaluation is based on the Supervisory Authority’s work programme for 2006 and a comparison with staff numbers at the Galileo Joint Enterprise.
The Supervisory Authority must therefore have its 39 staff in service by the third quarter at the latest to facilitate the transfer of know-how and activities to the Authority while the staff of the Joint Enterprise is being reduced until it is fully wound up in 2006, without jeopardising the smooth operation of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes.
A supplementary budget of EUR 3 050 000 would be required for that purpose. 2.2.
European Aviation Safety Agency The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was set up by Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2002[3] on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency.
The Agency’s remit is set out in Article 5 of the Regulation and concerns the airworthiness and environmental certification of aircraft and related products, parts and appliances, the certification of design and production organisations, the continuing airworthiness of aircraft and aeronautical products, parts and appliances, and the approval of organisations and personnel involved in these tasks.
The proposed increase in staff from 328 to 336 highly qualified personnel will mean a rise in salary levels and in particular an increase in mission expenses.
A supplementary budget of EUR 1 114 000 would be required for that purpose.
The appropriations necessary will be taken from the budget heading for transport safety (06 02 03) by redeploying funds within the budget allocation for policy area TREN. 2.3.
European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders The FRONTEX Agency’s 2006 budget, as presented by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget 2006, was drawn up on the basis of the legislative financial statement attached to the proposal for the Council Regulation establishing the Agency.
During the budgetary procedure, Parliament introduced an amendment raising the title 3 allocation to EUR 9.440 million.
The Community’s contribution to the Agency for 2006 therefore amounts to EUR 11.754 million.
The number of temporary staff posts stayed at 17 as specified in the financial statement.
To avoid increasing the Community contribution, therefore, EUR 3.786 million in appropriations should be transferred from title 3 to titles 1 and 2.
SECTION VIII PART B (EUROPEAN DATA-PROTECTION SUPERVISOR) The total budget for the European Data-protection Supervisor in 2006 amounts to EUR 3 583 833.
It includes a budget heading, B-1 1 7 5 “Translation and interpretation costs”, with appropriations amounting to EUR 112 491.
This figure was calculated on the basis of the number of translations done in 2004 and at the beginning of 2005, but the total number rose during the second half of 2005, triggering an upward trend.
Under an administrative cooperation agreement signed in June 2004 by the Secretaries-General of the Parliament, Council and Commission, and the European Supervisor, the Council is responsible for translation.
The European Data-protection Supervisor will limit the number of translations to the minimum necessary: translations into two languages of webpages and of the newsletter; translation of the annual report into 19 official languages; answering correspondents in their own language; translation of the Supervisor’s legal opinions into 19 languages for publication in the Official Journal.
This is the reason for requesting a preliminary draft amending budget for 2006; the appropriations entered in line B-1 1 7 5 “Translation and interpretation costs” should be increased from EUR 112 491 to EUR 667 036 in 2006.
