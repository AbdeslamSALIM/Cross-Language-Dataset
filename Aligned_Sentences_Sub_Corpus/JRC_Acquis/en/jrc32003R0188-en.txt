The timing of such decisions is likely to have repercussions on use of appropriations in the initial years of application of the pre-accession instrument in each applicant country. (5) As implementation of Sapard Programmes has only started for most Candidate Countries in 2002, whereas appropriations were first entered in the budget in 2000, it is appropriate to extend for two years the time limit for use of appropriations for the annual allocations 2000 to 2002 and thereafter to move progressively towards the rules of automatic decommitment as provided in Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999.
