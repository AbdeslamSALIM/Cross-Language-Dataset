For the Commission Margot WALLSTRÖM Member of the Commission (1) OJ L 99, 11.4.1992, p. 1. (2) OJ L 191, 1.8.1996, p. 56.
This documentation shall include the reports of at least three measurements of energy consumption made according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 °C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.
In case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall apply the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 60456:1999. 2.
This documentation shall include the reports of at least three measurements of water consumption made according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 °C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.
In case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall apply the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 6056:1999. 3.
Spin drying efficiency The machine shall achieve a residual moisture content (also termed D or spin extraction) of less than 54 %, in an EN 60456:1999 test, using the same standard 60 °C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.
This documentation shall include the reports of at least three measurements of the spin extraction made according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 °C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.
In case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall apply the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 6056:1999. 4.
Noise Airborne acoustical noise from the appliance, counted as sound power, shall not exceed LWAd 56 dB(A) during washing or LWAd 76 dB(A) during spinning, measured according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 °C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.
This documentation shall include the reports of at least three measurements of noise made according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 °C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.
The declared noise during washing and during spinning shall be derived from these measurements as laid down in the standards referred to in EN 60456:1999 (with the producer's risk a %amp%lt;= 5 %), shall be less or equal to the above requirements, and shall appear on the energy label.
In case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall apply the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 60456:1999. 5.
The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with this requirement.
ADDITIONAL CRITERIA 6.
The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with these requirements. 7.
The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with these requirements, and shall provide a copy of the instruction manual to the competent body assessing the application. 8.
The applicant and/or his supplier or suppliers, as appropriate, shall indicate to this competent body which flame retardants, if any, have been used in or on plastic parts heavier than 25 grams. 9.
Washing performance The machine shall achieve a washing performance index of more than 1,00 in an EN 60456:1999 test, using the same standard 60 °C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.
The machine will thus qualify for washing performance class A or B as defined in Directive 95/12/EC, Annex IV.
This documentation shall include the reports of at least three measurements of the washing performance index made according to EN 60456:1999, using the same standard 60 °C cotton cycle as chosen for Directive 95/12/EC.
In case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall apply the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 60456:1999.
