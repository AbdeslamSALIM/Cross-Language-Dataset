The instrument of approval, together with the Declaration of competence set out in Annex B to that Decision, was lodged with the Depositary on 20 December 2002.
The Rotterdam Convention entered into force on 24 February 2004. (2) In its judgment of 10 January 2006 in Case C-94/03 (Commission v Council) [4], the Court of Justice annulled Decision 2003/106/EC as it was based solely on Article 175(1), in conjunction with Article 300 of the Treaty, ruling that both Articles 133 and 175(1), in conjunction with the relevant provisions of Article 300, were the appropriate legal basis. (3) The Court's judgment does not affect the Community's status as Party to the Convention.
In accordance with Article 46 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the deposit of a new instrument of ratification is therefore not required.
Article 2 The President of the Council is hereby authorised to designate the person(s) empowered to deposit, on behalf of the Community, the Declaration of competence set out in the Annex to this Decision, in accordance with Article 25(3) of the Rotterdam Convention.
Article 3 This Decision shall take effect from 19 December 2002.
