Communication from the Commission - Mobilising the brainpower of Europe: enabling universities to make their full contribution to the Lisbon Strategy {SEC(2005) 518} /* COM/2005/0152 final */ Brussels, 20.4.2005 COM(2005) 152 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION Mobilising the brainpower of Europe:enabling universities to make their full contribution to the Lisbon Strategy {SEC(2005) 518} COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION Mobilising the brainpower of Europe: enabling universities to make their full contribution to the Lisbon Strategy “The search for knowledge has always been at the heart of the European adventure.
Research performance While the EU educates more graduates in science and technology and produces more PhDs overall, it employs only 5.5 researchers per 1 000 employees, which is marginally less than Canada and South Korea, but much less than the US (9.0) and Japan (9.7).
Minute ex ante control hinders universities’ capacity to react swiftly to changes in their environment.
Creating a European framework for higher education qualifications has been a major objective of the Bologna process[15].
It is also a fundamental economic and social sector in its own right, in need of resources for redeployment.
Strengthening cooperation within “Education %amp% Training 2010” The “Education %amp% Training 2010” work programme recognises the extreme importance of modernisation in higher education[22] - over and above the reforms called for in the Bologna process which, a fortiori , are also important for achieving the Lisbon Objectives.
Indicator analysis can also help measure performance in terms of funding and outputs[23], but the Commission does not propose specific European benchmarks in higher education.
Two major objectives for 2006 are to adopt the planned European Qualifications Framework (EQF) and to begin implementing the Recommendation on quality assurance (once adopted) which introduces important new tools, such as a European register of agencies meeting standards defined at European level[25].
