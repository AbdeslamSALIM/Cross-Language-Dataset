Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Apparatus Conductivity measuring instrument for measuring up to 0.5 ¶S cm-1 (1) accurate to within ± 2 %.
It is advisable to use measuring cells, the temperature of which may be maintained at 20 ºC ± 0.2 ºC by means of a water bath.
For preparation of all solutions (sugar solutions and potassium chloride solutions) double-distilled or deionised water with a specific conductivity less than 2 ¶S cm-1 must be used.
Method of operation A 28 % sugar solution is prepared either by dissolving 31.3 ± 0.1 g of sugar at 20º ± 0.2 ºC in a 100 cm3 graduated flask or by dissolving 28 g of sugar in water and making up to 100 g.
Deduct from the value read 50 % of the value read for the water used.
i.e. 3.13. ¶S cm-1 equal 1 point or 1 point = 0.0018 % ash.
Ash % = 0.320 × 18 × 10-4 × C28.

A daylight flourescent lamp is mounted in a small box, open in front, 20 cm deep, 120 cm wide, 50 cm high, in such a way that the perpendicular distance between the lamp and the sugar samples is about 35 cm.
The operator's eyes must be protected against the direct light of the lamp by means of a protective strip about 15 cm high.
Osram HNT 120 or Philips TL 25 W/55 lamps are suggested as suitable for the purpose.
Method of operation The sugar is put into small square boxes with white or light-blue inside lining (sides 60 mm, height 28 mm) and levelled by means of the cover.
Number of points = colour unit × 2, i.e. 0.5 colour unit = 1 point. 3.
Colour in solution ICUMSA Method 4 - after filtering through a membrane filter either 0.45 um (by the mercury extrusion method) or 0.6 um (by the Hagen-Poiseuille method). (Source : De Whalley, ICUMSA Methods of Sugar Analysis (1964, p. 57, Proc. 12th Session ICUMSA 1958, p. 55).
The cell path length must be at least 3 cm.
The comparison cell is filled with distilled water and a measurement made immediately at 420 nm.
Graduated flasks of 100 cm3.
If shorter tubes are used, they must have a similar relative accuracy, for example 100 mm ± 0.015 mm.
The filter paper used must have a moisture content between 6 and 8 %.
This reagent must satisfy ICUMSA requirements (source : De Whalley, ICUMSA Methods of Sugar Analysis (1964) p. 122).
The dimensions of the filter must be such that the 100 cm3 may be poured in all at once.
The saccharimeter must be checked by means of a quartz plate, the equivalent value of which must be about 100 ºS.
Making up the flask to the mark must also be made at 20 ºC ± 0.2 ºC.
The quartz control plate must also be at 20 ºC ± 0.2 ºC.

Equipment Water bath, 300 cm3 Erlenmeyer flasks, pipettes, 50 cm3 burettes.
Reagents Müller's solution : 35 g of crystalline copper sulphate (CuS04 × 158 5 H2O) (A.R.) are dissolved in 400 cm3 of hot distilled water.
Also dissolve 173 g of Rochelle salt (K.Na tartrate) and 68 G of anhydrous sodium carbonate in 500 cm3 hot water.
Method of operation In a 300 cm3 Erlenmeyer flask, 10 g of sugar are dissolved in distilled or demineralised water.
The flasks are suspended so that the level of the solution is 2 cm below the level of the water.
