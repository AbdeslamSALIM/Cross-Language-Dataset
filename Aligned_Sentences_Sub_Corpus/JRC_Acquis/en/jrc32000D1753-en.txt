The Kyoto Protocol to that Framework Convention agreed at the December 1997 Kyoto Conference makes provision for a reduction in the level of greenhouse gas concentrations. (2) Under the Kyoto Protocol, the Community has accepted the target of reducing its emissions during the period 2008 to 2012 in respect of a series of greenhouse gases by 8 % relative to 1990 levels. (3) The Kyoto Protocol requires the Parties referred to in Annex I to the Protocol to have made demonstrable progress in achieving their commitments by 2005. (4) Decision 93/389/EEC(4) established a mechanism to monitor Community emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. (5) In recognition of the importance of passenger cars as a source of CO2 emissions, the Commission has proposed a Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and to improve fuel economy.
It applies only to those passenger cars which are being registered in the Community for the first time and have not been registered previously elsewhere.
Article 2 For the purposes of this Decision: 1. %quot%passenger car%quot% means any motor vehicle of category M1, as defined in Annex II to Directive 70/156/EEC and which falls within the scope of Directive 80/1268/EEC.
It specifically excludes those vehicles which are re-registered in a second Member State or have been registered previously outside the Community; 3. %quot%certificate of conformity%quot% means the certificate, referred to in Article 6 of Directive 70/156/EEC; 4. %quot%specific emissions of CO2%quot% means those of a given passenger car, measured in accordance with Directive 80/1268/EEC and set out in Annex VIII to Directive 70/156/EEC and attached to type-approval documentation; 5. %quot%manufacturer%quot% means the person or body responsible to the approval authority for all aspects of the type-approval process and for ensuring conformity of production.
Article 5 Member States shall designate a competent authority for the collection and communication of the monitoring information and shall inform the Commission thereof no later than six months after the entry into force of this Decision.
Article 6 Member States shall report to the Commission no later than six months after the entry into force of this Decision on how they intend to implement its provisions.
Article 10 The reports for intermediate target years and the final target years(10) will indicate whether the reductions are due to technical measures taken by the manufacturers or to other measures such as changes in consumer behaviour.
Article 11 This Decision is addressed to the Member States.

ANNEX II Data quality and accuracy 1.
The precise format in which this information should be communicated to the Commission is described in Annex IV.
In the number of new cars in a given CO2 emissions category, c, and fuel type, f, is given by Nf,c, then the average CO2 emissions of these vehicles Cf,c,ave, is calculated from the sum of the individual CO2 emissions Cf,c, of each new car divided by Nf,c: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000202EN.000703.EPS%quot%%gt% 4.
The distribution of engine capacity of newly registered passenger cars For each of the following engine capacity categories, %amp%lt; 700, 700-800, 801-900, 901-1000, 1001-1100, 1101-1200, 1201-1300, 1301-1400, 1401-1500, 1501-1600, 1601-1700, 1701-1800, 1801-1900, 1901-2000, 2001-2100, 2101-2200, 2201-2400, 2401-2600, 2601-2800, 2801-3000, 3001-3500, 3501-4500, %amp%gt; 4500 cm3, the number of newly registered passenger cars of a given fuel type, the average engine capacity of these vehicles and also their average specific emissions of CO2 are to be recorded.
The data required, by manufacturer and for the total of all manufacturers, concern the average property (mass, power, engine capacity) and the average specific emission of CO2 for the passenger cars in the class.
The values of mass, power and engine capacity and specific emissions of CO2 are to be reported to the nearest whole number. %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000202EN.001101.EPS%quot%%gt% %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000202EN.001201.EPS%quot%%gt% %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000202EN.001301.EPS%quot%%gt%
