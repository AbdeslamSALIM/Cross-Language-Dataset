On 10 November 2004, the Community presented a new request to suspend every year the application of its tariff concessions to the United States at a level not exceeding the annual level of nullification or impairment determined in accordance with the result of the arbitration.
The DSB granted the requested authorisation on 26 November 2004.
The imposition of the additional import duty is postponed to 1 May 2005 so as to leave to the United States the opportunity to bring its legislation into conformity with the WTO ruling and recommendation.
The selection of products was initiated on the basis of the list of United States’ products which would have been subject to an additional import duty if the US had not repealed its safeguard measures on steel (annex II of Council Regulation 1031/2002 of 13 June 2002 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America, OJ L 157 of 15 June 2002, p. 8).
The effect of the additional import duty over one year on imports of the selected products originating in the United States represents a value of trade that does not exceed USD 27,81 million. - The second list (Annex II of the proposed Regulation) is a reserve list.
The selection of new products will be made from the reserve list in an automatic fashion by following the order of that list.
Since the United States failed to bring its legislation in conformity with the covered agreements, the Community requested to the DSB the authorisation to suspend the application of its tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 to the United States ([4]).
On 26 November 2004, the DSB granted the authorisation to suspend the application to the United States of tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 in accordance with the decision of the arbitrator.
The CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year for which data are available relate to the distribution of anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the Fiscal Year 2004 (1 October 2003 to 30 September 2004).
The effect of a 15% ad valorem additional import duty on imports of the products in Annex I originating in the United States represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed USD 27,81 million.
In respect of these products, the Community shall suspend the application of its tariff concessions to the United States from 1 May 2005.
The Decision will be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ([5]).
Article 2 An ad valorem duty of 15 % additional to the customs duty applicable under Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 shall be imposed on the products originating in the United States of America listed in Annex I to this Regulation.
Article 3 The Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the Community at that time.
b) The amendment shall be made so that the effect of the additional import duty on imports of the selected products originating in the United States represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed the level of nullification or impairment.
c) Except in circumstances foreseen in Article 3(1)(e), when the level of suspension increases, the Commission shall add products to the list in Annex I.
These products shall be selected from the list in Annex II following the order of that list.
d) Except in circumstances foreseen in Article 3(1)(e), when the level of suspension decreases, products shall be withdrawn from the list in Annex I.
e) The commission shall amend the rate of the additional duty when the level of suspension cannot be adjusted to the level of nullification or impairment by adding or removing products from the list in Annex I.
When products are added to the list in annex I, the Commission shall, at the same time, amend the list in annex II by removing those products from the list in annex II.
Article 4 The Commission shall be assisted by a Committee composed of the representatives of the Member States and chaired by a representative of the Commission.
Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply.
Article 5 The origin of any product to which this Regulation applies shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92.
Products listed in Annex I which are admitted free of import duties pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 shall not be subject to the additional duty.
Article 7 The Council shall decide on the repeal of this Regulation once the United States of America have fully implemented the recommendation of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.
