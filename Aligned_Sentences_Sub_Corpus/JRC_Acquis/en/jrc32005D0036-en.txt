Procedural overview (1) On 9 July 2003, the Commission adopted Decision 2004/166/EC on aid which France intends to grant for the restructuring of Société Nationale Maritime Corse-Méditerranée (SNCM) (hereinafter final decision), in which it declared part of the aid notified to be compatible with the single market provided that certain conditions were met.
SNCM could only operate the 11 ships which it already possessed at the date of the final decision, namely: the Napoléon Bonaparte, Danielle Casanova, Île de Beauté, Corse, Liamone, Aliso, Méditerranée, Pascal Paoli, Paglia Orba, Monte Cinto and Monte d'Oro.
The last paragraph of this Article reads: "If for reasons beyond its control SNCM has to replace one of its ships before 31 December 2006, the Commission may authorise such a replacement on the basis of a duly reasoned notice served by France". (2) In a letter dated 23 June 2004 [2], the French authorities requested permission from the Commission to replace the vessel Aliso with the Asco in the list of ships included in Article 2 of the final decision.
Objectives of the amendments (5) The main objective of the proposed amendments is to allow SNCM to use the Aliso rather than the Asco by amending the list of ships it is authorised to use under Article 2 of the final decision, and to facilitate the sale of the fourth ship provided for in the final decision by allowing potential purchasers to choose between the Aliso and the Asco, which are identical vessels. 2.
The high-speed vessel Asco had not yet been sold at the date of the French authorities’ request. (7) The reason for the proposed change is that given SNCM’s difficulties in disposing of the Asco, the French authorities wish to make it possible for the company to dispose of either of the two ships. (8) The French authorities have also forwarded a certificate from the Marseilles port authorities testifying that the Aliso has been berthed since 2 November 2003. 2.2.
Under the last indent in recital 97 of that Decision, the words "high-speed ship Asco" are replaced with "either the high-speed ship Asco or its sister ship, the high-speed ship Aliso".
Article 2 This Decision is addressed to the French Republic.
