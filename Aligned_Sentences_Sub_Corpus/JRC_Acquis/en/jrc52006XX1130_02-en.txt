A Statement of Objections was sent to AstraZeneca on 29 July 2003 in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation No 2842/98 [3].
AstraZeneca submitted a joint reply on 3 December 2003 (date of receipt) and requested an oral hearing pursuant to Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2842/98.
DG Competition stated that in the final decision they would rely exclusively on the written submissions that the complainant made in connection with the meetings in question.
I consider that this point of view is supported by the case-law of the Court of First Instance (joined cases T-191/98 and T-212/98 to T-214/98 â€” Atlantic Container Line, paragraphs 377, 386, 394-395).
The complainant submitted comments on the Statement of Objections on 16 December 2003, which were transmitted to AstraZeneca.
It took place on 16 and 17 February 2004.
Both before and after the oral hearing, on 9 March 2004, AstraZeneca submitted new information, in particular with a view to further responding to matters raised at the oral hearing.
By letter of 23 November 2004 the Commission then afforded AstraZeneca the opportunity to comment on a number of factual elements and considerations not explicitly mentioned in the Statement of Objections to which the Commission could refer in the final decision against AstraZeneca (%quot%letter of facts%quot%).
Upon request, I extended the delay for commenting on this letter of facts to 13 January 2005.
AstraZeneca provided its observations on the letter of facts by letter of 21 January 2005.
