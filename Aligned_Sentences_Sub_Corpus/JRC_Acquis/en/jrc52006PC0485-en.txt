With a view to simplification and clarification, the fixing of fishing opportunities in the Baltic Sea was for the first time implemented by a separate Regulation for 2006, Council Regulation (EC) No 52/2006 of 22 December 2005 fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks in the Baltic Sea for 2006.
The scientific advice on fishing opportunities in 2007 in the Baltic Sea was delivered by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in June 2006.
However, the Parties have agreed to establish management measures for shared stocks already from 1 January 2007 based on a provisional application of the agreement [exchange of letters].
With respect to the Eastern stock, ICES has recommended that no catch should be taken in 2007 and that a recovery plan should be developed and implemented.
The Commission has recently presented a proposal for a Council Regulation for such a plan[1].
Measures in the present proposal concerning monitoring, inspection and surveillance in connection with the recovery of the cod stocks in question are in accordance with the measures proposed in the proposal. - 130 Existing provisions in the area of the proposal The fishing opportunities and the allocation to Member States are subject to the provisions of annual regulations.
Of relevance to management of the fisheries in the Baltic Sea is also Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21 December 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound, amending Regulation (EC) No 1434/98 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 88/98. - Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union The measures proposed are designed in accordance with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy and is consistent with the Community's policy on sustainable development. 2.
CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT - Consultation of interested parties The sections on limiting the fishing effort and on laying down associated technical measures are in accordance with the decisions taken in the Council in December 2005 on Council Regulation (EC) No 52/2006 of 22 December 2005 fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2006 and have been subject to consultations with the fishing sector, NGO's dealing with fisheries issues in the Baltic Sea, and Member States concerned already in 2005.
For the cod stocks the proposed TACs reflect a long-term approach whereby the TACs and fishing effort are gradually reduced to sustainable levels over a number of years.
The central element of the plan is a gradual reduction of fishing effort to long-term sustainable levels that will provide high and stable yields.
The TAC proposal for the Eastern cod stock is however not set in line with a gradual reduction in fishing effort according to the proposed multi-annual plan due to exceptional circumstances.
Given the current state of the stock the gradual 10% reduction in fishing mortality proposed in the plan would lead to a 26% increase in the TAC.
The approach taken in the proposal will therefore in the medium to long term result in reduced fishing effort but stable or increasing quotas.
