Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure - Early warning system No 1&amp;ndash;5/2005 /* SEC/2005/0827 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 14.6.2005 SEC(2005) 827 final REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL on EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure Early warning system No 1–5/2005 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1.
THE 2005 BUDGETARY PROCEDURE 3 2.
COMMENTS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2005 BUDGET 4 3.
The Commission adopted the preliminary draft budget (PDB) on 28 April 2004 involving commitment appropriations amounting to EUR 50 675.5 million and payment appropriations amounting to EUR 50 113.9 million for heading 1.
The amount of forecasted appropriations, included in the 2005 PDB for sub-heading 1b were set at the ceiling for this sub-heading.
In October 2004, the Commission proposed the Amending Letter to the 2005 PDB thereby requesting commitment appropriations amounting to EUR 50 451.5 million and payment appropriations amounting to EUR 49 889.9 million for heading 1.
The Commission, on the basis of an evaluation of internal and external market conditions for the various products concerned, requested commitment appropriations amounting to EUR 43 289.3 million for heading 1a, thus, reducing its request by approximately EUR 224.0 million compared to the PDB’s level..
The 2005 EAGGF-Guarantee budget’s commitment appropriations amounted to EUR 49 676.0 million and its payment appropriations amounted to EUR 49 114.4 million for heading 1.
The significant factor characterising the appropriations included in the 2005 budget is that these are not based on any updated evaluation and analysis of internal and external market conditions for the various products involved as was the case with the credit needs forecasted in the proposed Amending Letter of October 2004.
Hereafter a brief commentary on the most significant divergences between the actual and the expected level of implementation for the various sectors of the 2005 budget follows. 2.1.
Subheading 1a – Market factors 2.2.1.
Sub-heading 1b – Rural Development The appropriations for rural development (EU-15) and for the transitional instrument for the new Member States were set at the ceiling for this sub-heading.
CONCLUSIONS For sub-heading 1a, the uptake of appropriations for the Member States' expenditure from 16 October 2004 to 31 March 2005 amounted to EUR 32 902.6 million, i.e: 76.8% of available appropriations.
