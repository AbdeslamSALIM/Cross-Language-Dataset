As in previous years, this document shows: - EDF implementation at 31 December 2004; - financial implementation forecasts for the current year (2005); - expenditure forecasts for 2006.
SUMMARY Table 1 gives an overview of implementation in 2004 and updated forecasts for 2005 and 2006.
The combined volume of commitments for the Commission and the EIB should be just over EUR 4 billion in 2005 and EUR 3.6 to 3.7 billion in 2006, enabling the total financial envelope made available by the Cotonou agreement to be used (including transfers from previous EDFs) by the end of 2007.
It clearly shows the structural upward trend of payments since 2000.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT FUNDS AT 31 DECEMBER 2004 1.1.
Of this amount, approximately EUR 6 475 million was committed.
The balance (EUR 9 674 million) will be committed before the end of 2007.
These figures take account of the mobilisation of the EUR 250 million of the conditional EUR 1 billion for the Water Facility.
Implementation of the EDFs in 2004 1.2.1.
Commitments After a record level of new commitments in 2003 (EUR 4 135 million), linked to the relatively late entry into force of the 9th EDF, commitments fell in 2004 to a normal level (EUR 2 962 million) for the second year of a new commitments cycle.
Especially for the Commission part (EUR 2 648 million), commitments remained slightly (7%) below the objective set in the October 2004 communication (EUR 2 850 million).
The Commission made decommitments of around EUR 298 million, bringing net Commission commitments to EUR 2 350 million. 1.2.2.
With a sum of EUR 2 464 million, the Commission has almost achieved the volume forecast in October last year (EUR 2 475 million).
The EIB made payments of EUR 93 million in line with its October forecasts.
The Commission made recoveries and payment corrections of about EUR 50 million, bringing the Commission’s total net payments to the order EUR 2 414 million. 1.2.3.
Breakdown of commitments and payments by instrument For information purposes, the table in Annex 2 gives the breakdown of expenditure by instrument for the years 2003 and 2004. 1.2.4.
Financial movements in 2004 The table below gives the start-of-year and end-of-year balances for 2004, the Member States’ contributions to the EDF and payments.
Note that the Commission ended 2004 with a cash balance of around EUR 62 million on its current account.

FINANCIAL IMPLEMENTATION FORECASTS FOR 2005 AND 2006 2.1.
Position at 30 April 2005 - Between 1 January and 30 April, the EIB had committed a total of EUR 126 million from the Investment Facility and approximately EUR 33 million for interest-rate subsidies (9th EDF). - Commitments from instruments managed by the Commission stood at EUR 297 million.
On 30 April, this volume wasEUR 615 million.
The total therefore stood at EUR 912 million (final amounts and those pending adoption).
Outlook for implementation to the end of 2005 - The EIB is raising its forecast for 2005 from EUR 555 million to EUR 610 million (+ EUR 55 million).
Of this EUR 610 million, EUR 537 million is earmarked for the Investment Facility and EUR 73 million for operations eligible for interest-rate subsidies. - For the Commission, the new estimates of EUR 3 500 million confirm the overall amount announced in October 2004 and remain quite ambitious at this stage but are in line with the timetable for fully using up the financial envelope by the end of 2007.
This amount includes EUR 80 million for the Water Facility (from the first tranche of EUR 250 million decided in 2004).
As to the mobilisation of the additional EUR 750 million (the balance of the conditional EUR 1 billion), EUR 120 million was included in this estimate on a preliminary basis.
Tentatively assuming that EUR 330 million are committed from the additional EUR 750 million, forecast commitments are EUR 3 100 million.
As regards the new instruments managed by the EIB, the Bank reckons that it will be able to commit EUR 550 million.
Commitments for the Commission and the EIB would therefore total about EUR 3 650 million.
State of implementation at 30 April 2005 - At 30 April 2004, the EIB had made payments of EUR 41 million. - The Commission had paid EUR 535 million.
Outlook for implementation to the end of 2005 - The EIB has revised its forecasts upwards, from EUR 222 million in October 2004 to EUR 445 million now (+ EUR 223 million).
Of this EUR 445 million, EUR 372 million is earmarked for the Investment Facility and EUR 73 million for operations eligible for interest-rate subsidies. - As last year, the Commission has been particularly careful when updating payment estimates.
The new forecast results in a total for the Commission of EUR 2 588 million, which is close to the estimate of October 2004 (EUR 2 620 million).
The slight drop is explained by (a) a downward revision by the EIB of payments under the old instruments (risk capital and interest-rate subsidies) from EUR 135 million to EUR 92 million, and (b) a reduction of the expected expenditure for the Water Facility from EUR 57 million to EUR 14 million (payments will probably be distributed over a longer period than estimated initially; also the great success of the call for proposal means a slight delay in the award of contracts).
EUR 191 million more than was estimated in October (EUR 2 842 million). 2.2.2. 2006 financial year For 2006, the forecast total is EUR 3 239 million, comprising: - EUR 489 million for the EIB from the 9th EDF, EUR 39 million of it for interest-rate subsidies; - EUR 2 750 million for the traditional instruments managed by the Commission.
FINANCIAL SITUATION FORECAST FOR 2005 AND 2006 Table 3: Financial forecasts for 2005 and 2006.
Taking into account also the EUR 42 million paid in January 2005 as 2004 contributions, total 2005 contributions can be reduced by EUR 175 million.
A preliminary forecast of contributions for 2006 produces a figure of EUR 3 160 million.
The increase in (estimated) contributions between 2003 and 2006 is considerable (2003: EUR 2 200 million; 2004: EUR 2 440 million;2005: EUR 2 845 million) and reflects the improving performance of the EDF. 4.
