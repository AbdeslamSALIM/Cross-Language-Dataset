The objective of making optimum use of the existing road network and achieving a significant reduction in its negative impact should be achieved without imposing additional burdens on operators, in the interests of sound economic growth and the proper functioning of the internal market. (3) The Commission announced its intention of proposing a directive on charging for the use of road infrastructure in the White Paper "European transport policy for 2010: time to decide".
Consequently, the Community framework should apply to commercial transport on the trans-European road network as defined in Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network [5].
Member States should, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, be free to apply tolls and/or user charges on roads other than those on the trans-European road network, in compliance with the Treaty. (6) For reasons of cost efficiency in the implementation of tolling systems, the entire infrastructure to which a toll relates may not necessarily be subject to access restrictions controlling tolls charged.
Such differentiation in the level of tolls should be proportionate to the objective pursued. (9) Aspects of commercial pricing for road infrastructure use not covered by this Directive should respect the rules of the Treaty. (10) This Directive does not affect the freedom for Member States which introduce a system of tolls and/or user charges for infrastructure to provide, without prejudice to Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty, appropriate compensation for these charges.
There should be a procedure allowing the Commission to adapt the requirements of Directive 1992/62/EC to technical progress following consultation with Member States for this purpose. (16) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [7]. (17) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to harmonise the conditions applicable to tolls and user charges for the use of road infrastructure, cannot be satisfactorily achieved by the Member States acting alone and can therefore, by reason of its European dimension and with a view to safeguarding the internal market for transport, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in Article 5 of the Treaty.
Article 2 shall be amended as follows: (a) point (a) shall be replaced by the following: "(a) "trans-European road network" means the road network defined in section 2 of Annex I to Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network [8] as illustrated by maps.
The maps refer to the corresponding sections mentioned in the operative part of and/or in Annex II to that Decision; (b) the following points shall be inserted: "(aa) "construction costs" means the costs related to construction, including, where appropriate, the financing costs, of: - new infrastructure or new infrastructure improvements (including significant structural repairs); or - infrastructure or infrastructure improvements (including significant structural repairs) completed no more than 30 years before … [9], where tolling arrangements are already in place on … [9], or completed no more than 30 years before the establishment of any new tolling arrangements introduced after… [9]; costs regarding infrastructure or infrastructure improvements completed before these time limits may also be considered as construction costs where: (i) a Member State has established a tolling system which provides for the recovery of these costs by means of a contract with a tolling system operator, or other legal acts having equivalent effect, which enter into force before… [9], or (ii) a Member State can demonstrate that the case for building the infrastructure in question depended on its having a design lifetime in excess of 30 years.
Member States may maintain or introduce tolls and/or user charges on the trans-European road network, or on parts of that network, only under the conditions set out in paragraphs 2 to 12.
This shall be without prejudice to the right of Member States to apply tolls and/or user charges on roads not included in the trans-European road network or to other types of motor vehicle not covered by the definition of "vehicle" on the trans-European road network, in compliance with the Treaty. 2.
A Member State may choose to maintain or introduce tolls and/or user charges applicable only to vehicles having a maximum permissible laden weight of not less than 12 tonnes.
Where a Member State chooses to apply tolls and/or user charges to vehicles below this weight limit, the provisions of this Directive shall apply. 3.
Tolls shall be determined in accordance with Article 7 and paragraph 1 of this Article. 3.
For new concession tolls put in place after … [12], the maximum level of tolls shall be equivalent to, or less than, the level that would have resulted from the use of a methodology based on the core calculation principles set out in Annex III.
The opinions of the Commission shall be made available to the Committee referred to in Article 9c(1). 6.
The Commission shall update and clarify Annexes 0, III and IV in the light of technical progress and Annexes I and II in the light of inflation, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 9c(3).
Article 3 This Directive shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Definition of the Network and of vehicles covered - Where a single tolling regime is not to be applied to the whole TEN road network, a Member State shall specify precisely the part or parts of the network which are to be subject to a tolling regime as well as the system its uses to classify vehicles for the purposes of toll variation.
Infrastructure costs 2.1.
Investment costs - Investment costs shall include the costs of construction (including financing costs) and the costs of developing the infrastructure plus, where appropriate, a return on the capital investment or profit margin.
Costs of land acquisition, planning, design, supervision of construction contracts and project management, and of archaeological and ground investigations, as well as other relevant incidental costs, shall also be included. - The recovery of construction costs shall be based on either the design lifetime of the infrastructure or such other amortisation period (not being less than 20 years) as may be considered appropriate for reasons of financing through a concession contract or otherwise.
Operating, management and tolling costs These costs shall include all costs incurred by the infrastructure operator which are not covered under Section 2 and which relate to the implementation, operation and management of the infrastructure and of the tolling system.
Such costs shall be apportioned on a fair and transparent basis between all vehicle classes that are subject to the tolling system. 4.
Vehicle class [3] | Equivalence factors | Structural repair [4] | Investments | Annual maintenance | Between 3,5t and 7,5t, Class 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | %gt% 7,5 t, Class I | 1,96 | 1 | 1 | %gt% 7,5 t, Class II | 3,47 | 1 | 1 | %gt% 7,5 t, Class III | 5,72 | 1 | 1 | - Tolling regimes which are based on forecast traffic levels shall provide for a correction mechanism whereby tolls are adjusted periodically to correct any under or over-recovery of costs due to forecasting errors. " [1] These provisions, together with the flexibility offered in the way costs are recovered over time (see the third indent of point 2.1), give considerable margin to fix tolls at levels which are acceptable to users and adapted to the specific transport policy objectives of the Member State. [2] The application of equivalence factors by Member States may take account of road construction developed on a phased basis or using a long life cycle approach. [3] See Annex IV for the determination of the vehicle class. [4] The vehicle classes correspond to axle weights of 5,5, 6,5, 7,5 and 8,5 tonnes respectively." -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX III " "ANNEX IV INDICATIVE VEHICLE CLASS DETERMINATION The vehicle classes are defined by the table below.

Directive as last amended by Directive 2002/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 67, 9.3.2002, p. 47). -------------------------------------------------- STATEMENT OF THE COUNCIL'S REASONS I.
INTRODUCTION The Commission adopted its proposal on 23 July 2003.
On 20 April 2004, the European Parliament adopted its opinion in first reading.
On 6 September 2005 the Council adopted its common position in accordance with Article 251 of the Treaty.
The negotiations took place in a policy context shaped by the Commission's 2001 White Paper on European transport policy for 2010 [3], which highlighted the crucial role of effective charging for transport infrastructure as a tool to rebalance the growth of the different transport modes, and thus address the increasing problems of congestion and environmental damage. 1.
weight, number of axles), the Council does not limit variation at all, and for emission class and time variation the 100 % limits are cumulative.
For cross-border cases the level of 25 % is also retained, 15 % being the maximum for non-cross-border cases.
These changes, which are effectively the Council's response to the concern expressed in Parliament's amendments 9, 33 and 52, are: - special treatment for contracts in the "construction costs" definition in Article 2(aa), - the possibility for tolls to include a profit margin in Article 7(9), - "indirect application" to concession contracts of the supervision system set out in Article 7a. 2.
European Parliament Amendments The response of the Council to amendments 2, 9, 12, 13, 17, 18, 21, 25, 28, 29, 30, 33, 36, 38, 41, 48, 50 and 52 is set out above in relation to the key issues.
In addition the Council has accepted, in whole, in part or in principle, amendments 3, 4, 10, 22, 24, 34, 39, 42 and 43.
The text achieves real, identifiable and tangible improvements to the 1999 Directive, carefully balancing the need to move towards a sustainable transport policy with the importance of a properly functioning internal market.
