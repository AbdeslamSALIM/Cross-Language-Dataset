Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on a %lsquo%Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to safeguard security of electricity supply and infrastructure investment%rsquo%(COM(2003) 740 final %mdash% 2003/0301 (COD)) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on a "Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to safeguard security of electricity supply and infrastructure investment" (COM(2003) 740 final â€” 2003/0301 (COD)) (2005/C 120/22) On 23 January 2004 the Council decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 95 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned proposal.
At its 412th plenary session of 27 and 28 October 2004 (meeting of 28 October 2004), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 134 votes to 7 with 14 abstentions. 1.
Background 1.1 EU energy policy has during recent years followed three main lines: - creating effective open markets for electricity and gas; - ensuring security of energy supply; and - reaching stringent environmental targets and in particular combating climate change.
There is, however, concern about whether sufficient investment will take place in the open market, in particular in peak capacity.
The target proposed for energy efficiency would cut yearly growth by 1 %.
Renewables and efficiency could thus compensate the growth in demand, and in addition possibly substitute existing capacity by much less than 1 % per annum.
Concerning Article 6(2), actions are needed for interconnectors, as mentioned in point 3.7. 4.5 Article 7: The EESC is not in favour of the measures proposed in this article for reasons mentioned in point 3.8.
Brussels, 28 October 2004.
