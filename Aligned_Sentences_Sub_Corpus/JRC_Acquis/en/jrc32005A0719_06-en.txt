According to the adjustment path, the deficit halves over the next four years, reaching just above 1 % in 2007.
At the same time, the outcome for 2007 is partly due to the new EU financial perspective 2007-2013, anticipating a significant rise in the net budgetary inflows from the EU budget.
Moreover, there is a risk of expenditure overruns, particularly regarding pension outlays should the review of the current pension indexation formula, announced for 2006, lead to a loosening of the parameters. (5) In view of this risk assessment, the budgetary stance in the programme may not provide a sufficient safety margin against breaching the 3 % of GDP deficit threshold with normal macroeconomic fluctuations except for the final year of the programme.
The ongoing pension reform has had a positive budgetary impact but the projected increase in pension expenditure beyond 2020 remains very high.
