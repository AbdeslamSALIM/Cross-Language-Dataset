of Commission Decision 92/562/EEC (1), and the random sample complies with the following standards (2): - clostridium perfringens : absence in 1 g (3), - salmonella : absence in 25 g, n = 5, c = 0, m = 0, M = 0 (4), - enterobacteriaceae : n = 5, c = 2, m = 10, M = 3 × 102 in 1 g (4); (b) a random sample of the end product was examined immediately prior to dispatch by a competent authority and found to comply with the following standard (2): Salmonella: absence in 25 g, n = 5, c = 0, m = 0, M =0; (c) the protein or product described above: - was produced by using ruminant protein (1), - was produced without using ruminant protein (1); (d) the end product: - was packed in new packaging material, or - in case of dispatch as bulk transport, containers or any other means of transport were thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with a disinfectant approved by the competent authority before use (1); (e) the end product was stored in enclosed storages; (f) the end product has undergone all precautions to avoid recontamination with pathogenic agents after heat treatment.
