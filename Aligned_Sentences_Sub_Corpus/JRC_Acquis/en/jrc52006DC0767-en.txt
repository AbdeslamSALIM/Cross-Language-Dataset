Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of directive 94/62/ec on packaging and packaging waste and its impact on the environment, as well as on the functioning of the internal market [SEC(2006) 1579] /* COM/2006/0767 final */ EN Brussels, 6.12.2006 COM(2006) 767 final REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DIRECTIVE 94/62/EC ON PACKAGING AND PACKAGING WASTE AND ITS IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE INTERNAL MARKET [SEC(2006) 1579] INTRODUCTION When Directive 94/62/EC on Packaging and Packaging Waste (hereinafter the “Packaging Directive”) was adopted, little information on the costs and benefits of packaging and packaging waste management was available.
This was done by calculating the costs and benefits of increasing recycling from the 1998 recycling levels to optimal recycling rates.
During the legislative process, the European Parliament and the Council called upon the Commission to present a more complete evaluation of the overall impacts of the directive in a report on the implementation of the Packaging Directive and its impact on the environment, as well as on the functioning of the internal market [1].
This report gives an ex-post assessment of environmental, economic, social and internal market aspects of the directive and an evaluation of the need for complementary measures for the prevention and recycling of packaging waste and the free circulation of packaging in the internal market.
As far as possible, the studies include information on all 25 Member States.
In 2002, around 66 million tonnes of packaging waste were generated in EU15.
For example, the greenhouse gas emissions related to packaging consumption in the EU15 are estimated at around 80 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per annum [10].
Out of the 66 million tonnes of packaging waste, around 36 million tonnes or 54% were recycled in 2002.
Packaging recovery and incineration at waste incineration plants with energy recovery increased from 31 million tonnes or 52% in 1997 to 41 million tonnes or 62% in 2002.
The total costs of packaging waste management [14] in 2001 were evaluated in three scenarios.
The cost of reducing 1 tonne of CO2 equivalent through packaging recycling has risen from 12 €/t in 1997 to 23 €/t in 2001 (compared to emission trading market prices ranging from about 9 to around 12.5 €/t of CO2 between October 2005 and October 2006 [16]).
This number needs to be compared to possible job losses in the waste disposal sector as a result of macroeconomic effects (the funds spent on recycling are not available for spending on other economic activities – such effects will decrease as disposal costs increase).
Recently, internal market problems arose through divergent interpretations of the voluntary or obligatory nature of material identification systems pursuant to Article 8 of the Packaging Directive and Decision 97/129/EC. 1.3.
Such an indicator is a conceptual tool that measures the environmental impact of packaging and produces a simple result allowing to improve packaging and facilitate the selection between different packaging systems.
Therefore, it appears unlikely that a further reduction of heavy metal limits would result in significant health and environmental benefits.
Landfill bans and landfill reduction targets have a similar effect as recycling targets in redirecting waste streams.
Past experience and ongoing cases show that unilateral measures adopted in different Member States still pose problems by requiring market operators to adapt their packaging to the requirements of each individual Member State which makes it more difficult for them to benefit from business opportunities within the internal market by selling the same product in the same packaging in different markets.
In particular, the infringement procedures in the beverage sector show that national measures can lead to distortions of competition and in some cases partitioning of the internal market, which contradicts the objectives of the directive.
The Commission is committed to react on any measures that risk disrupting the functioning of the internal market and are not environmentally justified, and will further evaluate the need to clarify or amend the provisions of Articles 5 and 7 of the Packaging Directive in order to facilitate the free circulation of goods within the internal market.
For these reasons, the Commission reiterates its commitment to promote a proper implementation of the essential requirements in relation to both Article 9 and 18 of the directive.
However, there is evidence that the beverage sector of the internal market is becoming increasingly partitioned as a consequence of unilateral measures taken at Member State level to promote environmental concerns related to packaging.
In order to achieve good implementation of the Packaging Directive and with a view to the improved functioning of the internal market, it is important that all actors contribute to the efficient functioning of the system of notification provided by Article 16 of the directive. 4.2.
Article 6(5) provides that “not later than 31 December 2007, the European Parliament and the Council shall […] fix targets for the third five-year phase 2009 until 2014 […]”.
At the same time, due to the specific situation in the Member States which joined the European Union on 1 May 2004, Directive 2005/20/EC [20] postpones the attainment of the "2008 targets" until 2012 for seven Member States, and until 2013, 2014, and 2015 for one Member State in each of these years.
The assessment contained in this report is based on the data and information collected around the years 2001 – 2002.
Very frequently, a figure of 30% by weight and 50% by volume is quoted.

The study estimates the per capita greenhouse gas emission at 216 kg CO2 per annum. [11] For reasons of simplicity and readability, “recovery and incineration at waste incineration plants with energy recovery” is referred to in this report as “recovery” even though this also includes incineration at waste incineration plants with energy recovery, which is in most cases a form of disposal pursuant to the terminology of Directive 75/442/EEC on waste. [12] In the following text, much of the focus of the analysis is on recycling in the sense of the recycling definition of the Packaging Directive (“the reprocessing in a production process of the waste materials for the original purpose or for other purposes including organic recycling but excluding energy recovery”).
The effect on recovery and incineration at waste incineration plants is deemed much smaller, as this rather depends on national decisions whether or not to build waste incinerators for waste management in general rather than the direct effect of the Packaging Directive.
The cost-benefit patterns of incineration with energy recovery are also considered to be less favourable than those of recycling for most of the packaging waste fractions covered by current recycling programmes.
