Type of product: Class 1.7: Fish — fresh carp and products derived therefrom 4.
The minimum weight of individual live fish is about 1,5 kg; the average sale weight is around 2,5 kg.
Historically, carp pond farming started in 1196 in Reinfeld (Holstein), at the Cistercian monastery of Reyenfelde, also becoming most widespread in the south of Schleswig-Holstein.
However, consumers throughout the Federal Land of Schleswig-Holstein are familiar with %quot%Holsteiner Karpfen%quot%.
The Schleswig-Holstein Chamber of Agriculture monitors proper compliance with good pond-farming practice, the hygiene of installations and the quality of table carp. 4.5 Method of production : %quot%Holsteiner Karpfen%quot% is reared in Schleswig-Holstein up to table-carp size (more than 1,5 kg).
In Schleswig-Holstein, the tradition of large carp weighing more than 2 kg each still prevails.
Carp pond farming was first a branch of economic activity on estate holdings, and is now undertaken both as a full-time and as a subsidiary business activity on around 200 family farms covering c. 2000 ha of ponds.
This denotes a weight increase of a good 2 kg per fish.
Unfortunately, pond farming in Schleswig-Holstein cannot always guarantee the supply of fry, due, in particular, to the cormorant problem.
