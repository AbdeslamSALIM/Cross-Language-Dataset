Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the operation of Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals /* COM/2006/0747 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 30.11.2006 COM(2006) 747 final REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT on the operation of Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT on the operation of Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals INTRODUCTION This report has been prepared in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals[1], hereinafter called the Regulation.
The report is a summary of the information available from the Member States and the Commission as at 8 September.
The full report is available on the Internet[2].
BACKGROUND EC Regulation 304/2003 The Regulation came into force on 7 March 2003.
About 3.5 - 4 man years per annum are dedicated to this work.
The main operative provisions and procedures of Regulation 304/2003 Export Notification (Article 7) The EU export notification procedure currently applies to around 130 chemicals and chemical groups that are listed in part 1 of Annex I of the Regulation (as last amended by Commission Regulation 777/2006).
Each exporter must submit an export notification prior to the first export of a listed chemical at least 30 days before the export is due to take place, and at least 15 days before the first export in each subsequent calendar year.
Export notifications received from third countries (Article 8) When the Commission receives an export notification about a chemical from a third country, it registers this in the EDEXIM database and acknowledges receipt..
Submitting PIC notifications of regulatory actions to the Convention secretariat (Article 10) The Commission shall submit notifications of qualifying Community regulatory actions.
Adopting Community import decisions for chemicals subject to the PIC procedure (Article 12) The Commission shall adopt Community import decisions for PIC chemicals, where appropriate including in those decisions information of relevant national measures at the level of Member States.
The PIC procedure and explicit consent (Article 13) The PIC procedure currently applies to 41 chemicals or chemical groups listed in Annex III to the Convention (reproduced in part 3 of Annex I to the Regulation).
The explicit consent procedure applies to chemicals that are banned or severely restricted in the Community within the meaning of the Convention (listed in part 2 of annex I to the Regulation, which currently lists 31 such chemicals or chemical groups) but are not yet included in the PIC procedure.
Export bans (Article 14) Chemicals and articles listed in Annex V, the use of which is completely prohibited in the Community, cannot be exported.
Currently Annex V comprises mercury-containing soaps, and 10 chemicals or groups of chemicals listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in accordance with the provisions therein.
U pdating Annex I to the Regulation (Article 22) The Commission shall review the list of chemicals contained in Annex I at least every year on the basis of developments under Community legislation and under the Convention.
The number of chemicals involved has doubled from 24 in 2003, to 54 in 2005.
The total number of importing countries has also increased from 70 in 2003 to 101 in 2005.
In 2005, 532 notifications were re-sent.
Overall at that time 239 explicit consents had been obtained and 15 requests for explicit consent had been refused, covering 12 chemicals/preparations and 11 countries.
The listing of explicit consents on EDEXIM was not introduced until 2004 so that some early cases may have been omitted.
Export notifications from third countries The total number of export notifications received from third countries recorded on EDEXIM was 220.
Work is well advanced in developing an "Enterprise" version that would enable exporters to electronically submit their export notifications for validation by their DNAs.
Updating of Annex I The Commission has regularly updated Annex I.
PIC notifications made To date the Commission has submitted notifications of EU regulatory actions for 12 chemicals.
Article 17 of the Regulation is generally worded and is rather weak.
In addition, linked to the development of a customs version of EDEXIM to meet the specific needs of customs officers, work is also well advanced in providing in TARIC for unique identification codes generated by EDEXIM for export notifications made, explicit consents obtained etc that could be used by exporters in section 44 of the export declaration form (the Single Administrative Document) to show that the rules have been respected and that could be readily verified by customs officers by checking on EDEXIM.
The latter applies especially to chemicals that are not PIC chemicals and fall only in part 2 of annex I, which is often confusing to third countries.
Some Member States would favour abolishing the explicit consent requirement for chemicals in part 2 of Annex I; or failing that, revising the criteria for including chemicals in that part of Annex I.
Making clearer the intended use in export notifications would also be helpful.
The procedure for handling export notifications from third countries is not optimal.
The majority of these notifications come from the USA.
The number of such cases is much higher than could have been anticipated causing additional workload.
The situation as regards chemicals listed in part 2 of Annex I is particularly problematic.
There are also a number of more minor issues where the scope of the rules could be clarified.
