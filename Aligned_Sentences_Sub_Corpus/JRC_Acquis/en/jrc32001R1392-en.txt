CHAPTER II CALCULATION OF THE LEVY Article 2 Definitions and equivalences 1.
The characteristics of milk, including fat content, referred to in Article 11 of Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92 shall be those associated with the individual reference quantity available on 31 March 2002.
Where the reference quantity for deliveries is increased or established under Article 4(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92, the representative fat content associated with the reference quantity converted into deliveries shall be 3,8 %.
However, if the representative content exceeds the average national fat content of milk collected in the Member State during the 12-month reference period during which they commenced production, the following provisions shall apply: (a) the producers concerned may not benefit from the negative correction provided for in the third subparagraph of Article 4(1) of this Regulation unless they provide supporting evidence to the contrary; (b) where Articles 6 and 7, Article 8(b), (d) and (e) and Article 8a(b) of Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92 are applied, the representative fat content of milk associated with the transferred reference quantity shall be reduced to the abovementioned national average content.
Where the quantity of milk delivered is expressed in litres, the 0,18 % adjustment per 0,1 gram of fat content shall be multiplied by the coefficient 0,971. 2.
Before 15 May each year, purchasers shall forward to the competent authority of the Member State a summary of the producers' statements, showing at least the total quantity and the average fat content of the milk and/or milk equivalent delivered to them and, where so required by decision of the Member State, for each producer, the reference quantity and the representative fat content, the quantity corrected in accordance with Article 4(1), the sum of the individual reference quantities and the corrected quantities and the average representative fat content of those producers' production.
Article 6 Declarations of direct sales 1.
Before 15 May each year, producers shall forward their declarations to the competent authority of the Member State.
Producers who fail to comply with the time limit referred to in paragraph 2 shall be required to a pay an amount equal to the levy due for a 0,01 % overrun of their reference quantity for direct sales for each calendar day of delay.
CHAPTER III PAYMENT OF THE LEVY Article 7 Notification of the levy The competent authority shall notify or confirm to purchasers and, in the case of direct sales, producers, the levies payable by them after reallocating, or not, by decision of the Member State, all or part of the unused reference quantities either directly to the producers concerned or, as the case may be, to purchasers with a view to their subsequent allocation among the producers concerned.
Article 9 Criteria for redistributing the excess levy 1.
Where appropriate, Member States shall determine the priority categories of producers as referred to in Article 2(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92, on the basis of one or more of the following objective criteria, in order of priority: (a) formal acknowledgment by the competent authority of the Member State that all or part of the levy has been wrongly charged; (b) the geographical location of the holding, and primarily mountain areas as referred to in Article 18 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999(8); (c) the maximum stocking density on the holding for the purposes of extensive livestock production; (d) the amount by which the individual reference quantity is exceeded; (e) the producer's reference quantity. 2.
CHAPTER IV NATIONAL RESERVE Article 10 Inclusion in the national reserve Reference quantities not, or no longer, allocated to individuals shall be included in the national reserve referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92.
CHAPTER V CONTROLS Article 11 Checking by the Member States 1.
Article 12 Number and frequency of checks 1.
These checks may not cover less than: (a) 40 % of the quantity of milk declared for the period concerned, in the case of Article 11(3)(a); (b) 5 % of the number of producers concerned, in the case of Article 11(3)(b).
Article 13 Approval of purchasers 1.
Article 14 Obligations of purchasers and producers 1.

CHAPTER VI COMMUNICATIONS AND FINAL PROVISIONS Article 15 Communications 1.
Where the provisions relating to the questionnaire referred to in paragraph 1(e) are not complied with, the Commission shall withhold a flat-rate amount, under Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2040/2000(11), from advances on the entry in the accounts of the agricultural expenditure of the Member States.
That amount shall be equal to a percentage of the levy payable for a theoretical overrun of the overall reference quantity concerned calculated as follows: (a) where the questionnaire is not forwarded by 1 September or if data essential for calculating the levy are missing, the percentage shall be 0,01 % for each week of delay; (b) if a discrepancy of more than 10 % is found between the sum of the quantities delivered or sold directly as notified in the updates provided for in paragraph 3 and those given in the initial response to the questionnaire, the percentage shall be 0,1 %. 3.
