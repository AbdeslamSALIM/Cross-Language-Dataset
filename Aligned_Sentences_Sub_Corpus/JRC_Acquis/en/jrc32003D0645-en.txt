PROCEDURE (1) In 1991, the Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 3433/91(3), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in, inter alia, the People's Republic of China. (2) By Regulation (EC) No 192/1999(4) the Council, further to an investigation in accordance with Article 13 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the basic Regulation), extended the above anti-dumping measure to: (a) imports of gas-fuelled non-refillable pocket flint lighters consigned from or originating in Taiwan; and (b) imports of certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan. (3) In 2001, Council Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001(5), imposed a definitive duty on gas fuelled non-refillable pocket flint lighters falling within CN code 9613 10 00 (TARIC code 9613 10 00*19 ) originating in the People's Republic of China and maintained the anti-dumping duties extended by Regulation (EC) No 192/1999 to imports of certain refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan falling within CN code ex 9613 20 90 (TARIC codes 9613 20 90*21 and 9613 20 90*29 ) and to imports of non-refillable lighters consigned from Taiwan and falling within CN code 9613 10 00 (TARIC code 9613 10 00*19 ) or originating in Taiwan and falling within CN code 9613 10 00 (TARIC code 9613 10 00*19 ).
When examining the Community interest, and in accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation, the interests of the exporting producers cannot be taken in consideration.
In this context it should be noted that no comments were received from parties mentioned in Article 21 of the basic Regulation, such as users, importers or consumers indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest.
As mentioned above in recitals 15 and 17, the current investigation did not lead to any formal conclusions which would justify the amendment or repeal of Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001 by which it was found that dumped imports of flint lighters from the People's Republic of China caused injury to the Community industry.
The anti-dumping proceeding initiated pursuant to Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 concerning imports of disposable gas-fuelled pocket lighters originating in the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam is hereby terminated. 2.
