Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics on migration and international protection /* COM/2005/0375 final - COD 2005/0156 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 14.9.2005 COM(2005) 375 final 2005/0156 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on Community statistics on migration and international protection (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL - Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The development of Community policies and legislation on migration and asylum has highlighted the need for comprehensive and comparable European statistics on a range of migration-related issues.
The Thessaloniki European Council of 20 June 2003 concluded that more effective mechanisms were needed for the collection and analysis of information on migration and asylum in the European Union.
The European Parliament in its resolution of 6 November 2003 noted that legislation was required to ensure the production of comprehensive statistics necessary for the development of fair and effective Community policies on migration. - General context Major efforts have been made since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force to develop common systems for asylum and immigration in the European Union.
In April 2003, the Commission published an Action Plan (COM (2003) 179 final)[1] setting out its short-to medium-term aims for the development of its statistical activities on migration and asylum.
The proposal here follows the Commission's intention stated in the Action Plan to introduce a legislative base for these statistics. - Existing provisions in the area of the proposal / Repeal of existing legislation New community needs on statistics on migration and asylum render obsolete the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 311/76 of 9 February 1976 on the compilation of statistics on foreign workers[2], which should therefore be repealed.
This information will be used as a guide to the interpretation of the statistics. - Legal basis: Article 285 EC Treaty Article 285 provides the legal basis for Community statistics.
In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty, the objective of the proposed action, namely the systematic production of harmonised Community statistics on international migration and asylum, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting individually and can therefore be better achieved by the Community.
Appropriate rules are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics[3].
The proposed Regulation only applies harmonised statistical definitions for migration and asylum.
Article 2 Definitions 1.
Where necessary, the definitions in paragraph 1 may be adapted, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 11 (2). 3.
Where necessary to ensure harmonisation of statistics referred to in this Regulation, additional definitions to those given in paragraph 1 may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 11 (2). 4.
The fact that a Member State is not bound by one or more of the legal texts referred to in the definitions in paragraph 1 shall not exempt the Member State from providing the statistics falling under the scope of this Regulation.
