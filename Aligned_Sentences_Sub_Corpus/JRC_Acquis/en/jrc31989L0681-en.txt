HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Directive 87/402/EEC is hereby amended as follows: 1.
If cracks or tears which cannot be considered negligible appear during an impact test, a second, similar test, but with a height of fall of: Hm = 10 × 12 + 4a Hm = H 10 × 12 + 4a 1 + 2a shall be performed immediately after the impact tests causing these tears or cracks to appear, ''a'' being the ratio of the permanent deformation to the elastic deformation (a = Dp/De) as measured at the point of impact.
The additional permanent deformation due to the second impact must not exceed 30 % of the permanent deformation due to the first impact.
Article 3 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
