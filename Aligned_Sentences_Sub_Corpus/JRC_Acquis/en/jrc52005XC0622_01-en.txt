Specification: (summary of requirements under Article 4(2)) Name: "Montes de Granada" Description: Extra virgin olive oil obtained from healthy and ripe olives of the olive tree (Olea Europaea) belonging to the principal varieties (Picual, Lucio and Loaime) and secondary varieties (Escarabajuelo, Negrillo de Iznalloz, Hojiblanca and Gordal de Granada) grown in the defined area.
The lipid composition is marked by a high content in oleic acid which is usually above 80 %, sometimes reaching 83 %.
Geographical area: It coincides with the natural region of the Montes de Granada, is situated in the Province of Granada and includes the following municipalities: Alamedilla, Alfacar, Alicún de Ortega, Benalúa de las Villas, Calicasas, Campotéjar, Cogollos Vega, Colomera, Darro, Dehesas de Guadix, Deifontes, Diezma, Fonelas, Gobernador, Guadahortuna, Güevéjar, Huélago, Iznalloz, the northern part of the Municipality of La Peza to the River Fardes, Montejícar, Montillana, Morelábor, Nívar, Pedro Martínez, Piñar, Torrecardela and Villanueva de las Torres, the eastern part of the Municipality of Moclin to the natural boundary formed by the River Velillos and the northern part of the Municipality of Albolote y Atarfe formed by the Rivers Cubillas and Colomera up to the point where they meet.
The oil is obtained in the mills in the defined geographical area that are listed in the Regulating Board's oil mill register.
The seedlings are placed in 50 cm deep casillas (areas of soil worked with the hoe).
The layout of a grove depends on its age, in older groves the spacing between trees is 12 m (square planting) and 8 m (triangular planting), the number of scions per tree being two, three or four.
They are rich in marly limestone materials eroded from the sierra and therefore have a high calcium carbonate content (over 40 %).
Average annual rainfall varies between 400 and 600 mm or even less in years of drought.
