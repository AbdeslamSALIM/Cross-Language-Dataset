Specification (summary of requirements under Article 4(2)) Name : "Barèges-Gavarnie" Description : Fresh adult sheepmeat from ewes aged between 2 and 6 years or castrated males known as "doublons" aged over 18 months.
The ewe carcass weighs a minimum of 22 kg, while the "doublon" carcass weighs a minimum of 23 kg.
Geographical area : The meat originates from animals born, raised and slaughtered in the geographical area made up of the following municipalities of the department of Hautes-Pyrénées: Barèges, Betpouey, Chèze, Esquièze-Sère, Esterre, Gavarnie, Gèdre, Grust, Luz-St-Sauveur, Saligos, Sassis, Sazos, Sers, Viella, Viey, Viscos, Vizos, and part of the municipality of Cauterets.
Each flock should contain at least one Barégeoise ram per 50 ewes and must include a minimum of 20 % "doublon" castrated males of all age ranges in relation to the number of ewes.
The farmer keeps replacement ewe lambs originating from his flock equivalent to a minimum of 30 % of the number of ewes.
Each animal must spend at least 12 months in the flock of the holding.
The total stocking density of the animals on a holding may not exceed 1,4 LU per hectare, with mountain pastures and vacant low pastures included in the calculation for a maximum of 180 days per year.
The intermediate areas are located at an altitude of between 1000 m and 1800 m.
The summer period: from May to October.
Grazing in mountain pastures is compulsory for all of the flock between 15 June and 31 August at the least, excepting animals that are taken for slaughter.
During their second period in the mountain pasture, "doublon" castrated males cannot be slaughtered before 1 July.
If there is a lack of fodder during this period, dried fodder may be purchased from outside the production area, up to a maximum of 20 % of the needs of the flock for the period.
The only authorised food additives are vitamins, trace elements and technological additives contained in mineral licks or in complete feedingstuffs for animals under the age of 4 months.
Slaughter takes place within a maximum of 15 hours after the start of unloading.
The whole carcasses undergo a period of airing in a strongly ventilated refrigerated room at a temperature of between 4 °C and 6 °C for a minimum of 24 hours.
Variations in temperature and cloud cover factors have resulted in a distribution of vegetation by height that is clearly visible in the landscape.
