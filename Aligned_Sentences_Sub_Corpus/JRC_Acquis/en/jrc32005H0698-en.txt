to ensure the coherence of data. (6) Any mandated cost accounting or accounting separation methodology used in particular as a basis for price control decisions should be specified in a way that encourages efficient investment, identifies potential anti-competitive behaviour, notably margin squeezes, and should be in accordance with the national regulatory authorityâ€™s policy objectives as set out in Article 8 of Directive 2002/21/EC. (7) The implementation of a new or revised costing methodology may indicate that current levels of regulated charges and/or price mechanisms are inappropriate or misaligned in some way.
