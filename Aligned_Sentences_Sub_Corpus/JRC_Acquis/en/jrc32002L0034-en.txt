However, footnote 1 to entry 293 allows, under the conditions set out therein, the presence of natural radioactive substances and of radioactive substances caused by artificial contamination from the environment by making reference to Directives of 2 February 1959 laying down the basic standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation(3).
Therefore, entry 293 of Annex II should be amended accordingly. (2) On the basis of IFRA (International Fragrance Association) Code of Practice, the SCCNFP has listed 36 substances that must not form part of fragrance compounds used in cosmetic products.
Therefore the 28 remaining fragrance ingredients should be included in the list of Annex II.
Therefore, polyacrylamide should be included in Annex III, Part 1. (6) The SCCNFP has made toxicological evaluations of 61 hair dyes, including recommendations on their field of application, maximum concentration levels and specific warnings.
One is already included under reference No 16 in Annex III, Part 1, which shall therefore be amended.
Therefore the 60 remaining hair dyes should be included in Annex III, Part 2.
Entry 8 of Annex III, Part 1, covers a group of phenylendiamine derivatives used as hair dyes.
In order to avoid double entries, the text in column b should be amended to except those derivatives listed elsewhere in Annex III. (7) The SCCNFP recommends that musk xylene can be safely used in cosmetic products, excluding oral care products, up to a maximum daily theoretically absorbed dose of about 10 Îźg/kg/day.
Article 2 Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that cosmetic products containing the substances listed in Annexes II, III and VII to Directive 76/768/EEC, as set out in the Annex to this Directive, which are supplied to the final consumer after 15 April 2004, comply with the provisions of this Directive.
Article 4 This Directive shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Article 5 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
