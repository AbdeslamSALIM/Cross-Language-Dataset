Legal proceedings for failure to transmit transposition measures were initiated in 2003 before the Court of Justice against the countries which had not transposed the Directive[3].
Infraction procedures have been opened in December 2004 against two new Member States which have not completed the transposition of the Directive[4]. 1.2.
The Group comprises specialists in patent law and highly qualified persons in the field of biotechnologies[5]. . 1.3.
Community action on cross-licences The first 16c Report indicated that the provisions of Article 12 of the Directive and Article 29 of Regulation 2100/94 on Community plant variety rights[6] were not compatible with each other and that Article 29 of the Regulation should be amended.
Accordingly, on 11 December 2003, the Commission presented a draft Regulation amending Regulation 2100/94 on Community plant variety rights[7].
The draft was adopted by the Council on 29 April 2004[8].
The following analysis is based on the articles and recitals of the Directive, but also, inter alia, on preparatory work and the decision of the Court of Justice of 9 October 2001[9], in which the Court rejected an application for annulment of the Directive.
On examination of the detailed provisions of the Directive, it can be seen that Articles 8, 9, 10 and 11 make up Chapter 2 of the Directive which is entitled “Scope of protection”.
The informal Group of Experts met in March 2003 to discuss this issue.
The question of whether the Directive specifically addressed the patentability of stem cells was raised in the first 16c Report, and referred to the Group of experts for discussion in May 2003.
The Commission will continue to monitor developments in this area. [1] OJ L 213, 30.7.1998, pp. 13-21.
