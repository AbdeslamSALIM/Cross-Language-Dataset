Around 40 % of this budget is used for rural development investments.
They cover a wide range of projects, for which management and implementation is shared by the Commission and the Member States (see paragraphs 1 to 10).
Member States’ programmes focus largely on the agricultural sector and do not sufficiently take into account the characteristics of the geographical area supported (see paragraphs 16 to 28).
A significant part of the expenditure is implemented in areas which are not predominantly rural.
When compared to the previous programming period, investment support for rural areas decreased significantly (see paragraphs 40 to 46).
It was not always possible to identify the effects of the projects, but when this could be done key factors which increased their effectiveness were synergy with other projects and being sited in rural areas (see paragraphs 47 to 52).
Shortcomings were also found in the implementation of the monitoring and evaluation system (see paragraphs 53 to 63).
In order to achieve this, the Commission should work with the Member States towards improved effectiveness of the policy.
INTRODUCTION Background 1.
This Special Report presents observations on the following measures of the Rural Development Regulation [2]: %quot%investment in agricultural holdings%quot%, %quot%improving the processing and marketing of agricultural products%quot% and %quot%promoting the adaptation and development of rural areas%quot%.
They cover around 40 % of the available budget.
The first relates to the agricultural sector, and can be summarised as improving agricultural competitiveness and sustainable land management.
In particular, the Community shall aim at reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions or islands, including rural areas. | SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES FOR RD INVESTMENT MEASURES [6] Investment in agricultural holdings | Improving the processing and marketing of agricultural products | Article 33 | 1.To reduce production costs2.To improve and redeploy production3.To increase quality4.To preserve and improve the natural environment, hygiene conditions and animal welfare5.To promote diversification of farm activities | 1.To guide production in line with foreseeable market trends or encourage the development of new outlets for agricultural products2.To improve or rationalise marketing channels or processing procedures3.To improve the presentation and preparation of products or encourage the better use or elimination of by-products or waste4.To apply new technologies5.To favour innovative investments6.To improve and monitor quality7.To improve and monitor health conditions8.To protect the environment | No specific objectives provided | 7.
The Regulation also provides specific objectives for two of the investment measures, which are also set out in Table 1.
Figure 1 gives an overview of these elements and their relationships: +++++ TIFF +++++ 13.
Audit approach 14.
Clarity of the strategy Observation 1 The flexibility of the Regulation (broad objectives, lack of priorities) and the lack of a clear strategy in the Member State programmes have led to a situation where it is unclear to which objective the funds have contributed. 16.
The Rural Development Regulation aims, on the one hand, to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CAP and, on the other hand, to contribute to economic and social cohesion (see paragraph 6).
The Regulation does not set out which measure should contribute to which objective, nor in which proportion the objectives should be obtained. 17.
Text box 1 Same measure for different objectives One of the measures in the Spanish programme for improving agricultural structures in Objective 1 areas is investment in agricultural holdings.
The measure water resources management and reparcelling accounts for 70 % of the EAGGF contribution to the Portuguese programme for %quot%Lisboa e Vale do Tejo%quot%.
A single project located in a densely populated area has absorbed 29 % of the whole EAGGF contribution to the programme.
Under the Dutch RDP, this Article 33 indent is the financially most important measure.
The Commission approved RDP shows that from the amount allocated to this indent, 87 million euro should contribute to the objective of sustainable agriculture and 16 million euro to the objective of nature and landscape.
However, the Court’s audit showed that in reality 86 % of the funds had as main objective nature development and only 14 % for sustainable agriculture.
In addition, they have an integrated approach: multi-sectoral with involvement of all actors and resources in the area concerned.
The Commission concludes in its third report on Economic and Social Cohesion that many problems of rural areas are territorial in character [9]. 22.
The Court found that the Member State programmes predominantly have this latter approach.
However, an analysis by the Court of rural development expenditure for the current programming period shows that almost 90 % of rural development expenditure is paid to the agricultural sector. 26.
Text box 2 Elements of a partial territorial approach in Italy's programme for Campania The Campania programme includes the following elements of a territorial approach: - appropriate description and diagnosis of the territory.
They represent 23 % of the EAGGF contribution.
However the funds available are limited (the minimum Community percentage for Leader is 5 % for EU-15 and 2,5 % for the new Member States; the rate for the multi-sectoral measures is 10 %).
Article 33 is entitled %quot%promoting the adaptation and development of rural areas%quot%.
The Court found for the Member State programmes audited that three did not contain a definition of rural areas, that five had a definition which was not applied, and that only one programme (Campania) actually applied its definition of rural areas. 30.
The Member States have generally not done so in their programmes.
In addition, available funds are limited.
For reasons of effectiveness, funds should be prioritised according to needs. 33.
In general these are small farms. 12 % of the region's biggest farms (more than 20 ha) absorbed 41 % of the grants.
Most of the funds of this measure (76 %) are used to modernise existing irrigation networks.
Irrigated areas cover around 12 % of the total surface of Objective 1 regions, and are more densely populated and more competitive than non-irrigated areas.
This has led to a situation where the majority of the funds is concentrated in 12 % of the surface area in the most favourable position.
Only a small percentage of the aid (around 20 %) was implemented in areas which were defined as depopulated (%lt% 38,5 inhabitants/km2).
Deadweight Observation 4 A lack of effective targeting also leads to a risk of increased deadweight effects, which reduce the effectiveness of the aid. 35.
However, a certain level of deadweight can be considered unavoidable, as beneficiaries must be ready to undertake investment projects. 36.
Because the funds were insufficient to do so at the public co-financing rate foreseen in the RDP, the rate was reduced significantly to an average of 15 %.
This increased the likelihood of deadweight — the beneficiaries had to finance 85 % themselves.
This condition was implemented by requiring an income per full-time worker of at least 21577 euro.
The location of projects Observation 5 A significant part of the expenditure is implemented in areas which are not predominantly rural, to the detriment of the amounts available for such areas. 40.
The Commission has little information on the location of the results and impacts of RD Investments (see further paragraph 61).
The Court drew a representative sample of 300 EAGGF projects, and classified their location in categories of rurality.
In this period Article 33 measures outside Objective 1 areas were only implemented in certain areas, called %quot%Objective 5b%quot%, which had to fulfil certain criteria of rurality and had to be approved by the Commission; (b) the classification of the NUTS III area in the ESPON typology, developed as part of the ESPON programme which is jointly managed by the Commission and the Member States; (c) the relative rurality of the NUTS III area according to national definitions available for statistical purposes; (d) the classification of the NUTS III area in OECD typology, which is based on population density and which has been generally applied for international analysis since 1994. 41.
It shows that for regions outside Objective 1, depending on the typology used, between 29 % (OECD) and 55 % (ex Objective 5b classification) of the expenditure is in non-rural areas.
For Objective 1 regions between 9 % (OECD) and 22 % (national definition) of rural development support is located in non rural areas.
The population density was also analysed for the 300 projects.
For all types of investment measures audited, both LAU II and NUTS III areas have on average a higher population density than the European average of 120 inhabitants per square km.
Table 3 Average population density of the location of RD investments in a representative sample of 300 EAGGF projects Sample population | Population density of the location of the investment (inhabitants/km2) | LAU II | NUTS III | Regions outside Objective 1 | 259 | 242 | Objective 1 regions | 237 | 246 | 44.
The results of the sample thus show that a significant part of the expenditure for the measures reviewed (47 % for regions outside Objective 1, 21 % for Objective 1 regions) is implemented in areas with the highest GDP, contrary to the objective of reducing territorial imbalances (see paragraph 6). 46.
The average population density of the location of the investment is very similar for regions in and outside Objective 1 (see Table 3).
This indicates that the investments are concentrated in the richest parts of the Objective 1 regions.
Results and impacts of the projects reviewed on the spot Observation 6 It was not always possible to identify the effects of the projects, but when this could be done key factors which increased their effectiveness were synergy with other projects and being sited in rural areas. 47.
As part of the analysis of the 31 projects reviewed during the Member State visits, the audit addressed the question %quot%what were the project’s results and what were the key variables which have determined them?%quot%.
For another 15 projects [16], evidence for some effects was found, albeit not for all the intended effects.
Point 2: Projects are more effective when synergy takes place 49.
The Court found that isolated projects, which had no link with other projects, had less impact and were less effective. 50.
Member States do not always require that projects are part of a wider concept or local development plan.
In those cases, in particular for Article 33 measures, effective targeting would increase the effectiveness of the assistance.
Point 3: Location and impact in rural areas 51.
Only seven projects [19] also had an impact in a wider area. 52.
This has a significantly lesser impact on rural development and is thus not effectively addressing the problems of rural areas. +++++ TIFF +++++ +++++ TIFF +++++ Photo 1 Project No 15, construction of a viewing tower in Brandenburg | Photo 2 Project No 11, purchase of agricultural land by the State in the Netherlands | +++++ TIFF +++++ +++++ TIFF +++++ Photo 3 Project No 19, upgrading of the village centre of Kirchwahlingen in Niedersachsen | Photo 4 Project No 22, modernisation of old concrete aqueducts by a system of underground pipes and pumps in Spain | Audit question 4: Are the outputs, results and impacts properly monitored and evaluated?
The overall framework and implementation of the monitoring and evaluation system Observation 7 Implementation by the Commission and the Member States of the monitoring and evaluation system does not provide adequate and reliable information about the outputs, results and impacts of RD investments. 53.
Three types of evaluations are performed: ex-ante (at programme planning stage), mid-term (not later than 31 December 2003 and where necessary updated two years later) and ex post (by 31 December 2008).
The Commission has also contracted evaluators to prepare summary reports concerning the information included in Member States’ ex post evaluations for the previous programming period (which were available in 2003) and the mid-term evaluations of the present period. 56.
When taking into account that the Commission has addressed some of the present shortcomings with the changes proposed for the new programming period the Court finds that the overall framework of the monitoring and evaluation system is generally adequate. 57.
It cannot be compared with the year 2000 because the Commission changed the indicators in 2001, and updated figures for the year 2000 are only partly available. 60.
The weaknesses (see paragraph 58) also affect the evaluation reports.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 64.
Furthermore the Member State programmes did not set out clear strategies in order to address problems of rural areas (see paragraphs 16 to 18). - The Commission should for the next programming period ensure that when it adopts the rural development programmes Member States have identified clear strategies which relate to specific objectives and which will allow the assessment of the cost effectiveness relationship of the investments. 65.
This strong focus on agriculture puts at risk achievement of the other global objective of the Regulation: contributing to economic and social cohesion of rural areas which would be best served by a territorial approach as applied in other Structural Funds (see paragraphs 19 to 26). - When designing the arrangements for the programming period 2007 to 2013, appropriate attention should be given to the balance between the two core objectives of the Regulation: that relating to the CAP and that aiming to reduce territorial imbalances. 66.
There is a lack of effective conditions and selection procedures to target funds on the most needy geographical areas and beneficiaries (see paragraphs 29 to 34). - The Commission should ensure that, for reasons of effectiveness, Member States’ programmes prioritise allocation of funds according to their needs.
The Court identified that a significant part of the expenditure is implemented in areas which are not predominantly rural and that, when compared to the previous programming period, investment support for rural areas decreased significantly (see paragraphs 40 to 46). - When approving the rural development programmes the Commission should make sure that Member States have clearly justified in which areas investments are most needed. 68.
Regarding the results and impacts of the projects reviewed on the spot it was found that establishing the effect is difficult but that factors which influenced positively the effectiveness were synergy with other projects and being located in rural areas (see paragraphs 47 to 53). - The Commission should encourage Member States to analyse key factors influencing succes of investment projects and disseminate cases of good practice. 69.
The system for monitoring and evaluation does not provide the Commission and the Member States with sufficient and reliable information on outputs, results and impacts (see paragraphs 53 to 63). - The Commission should improve data collection and reporting in order to be better informed on the effectiveness of the investments.

For the 1994 to 1999 programme period, the Commission approved 83 zones following these criteria.
The area thus affected by the Objective 5b programmes covered 26 % of the EU's surface area and 9 % of its population. 2.
There is no evidence that this project, costing around 380000 euro, develops the rural area effectively.
Point 2 — Projects are more effective when synergy takes place Example 1: Synergy with other instruments and objectives, part of a wider strategy The project concerned the purchase of agricultural land by the State under the Article 33 measure of reparcelling in the Netherlands (see also Photo 2).
Example 2: Synergy with other projects and part of a wider strategy Under the Article 33 measure %quot%renovation and development of villages and protection and conservation of the rural heritage%quot%, the village centre of Kirchwahlingen (Germany) was upgraded (see also Photo 3).
The project was complemented by two other closely-related public projects and one private project which were also identified in the village renewal plan.
Moreover, the project was part of a wider concept of the (in total) 15 village renewal plans of the three local joint-communitoes (Samtgemeinde).
Point 3 — Location in a non-rural areas One of the projects reviewed for the measure irrigation in Spain has a total investment of 9,9 million euro, co-financed by EAGGF for 2,4 million euro.
Through the middle of the irrigated agricultural area runs a highway which leads from the city to the port of Castellón, a distance of around 5 km.
Castellón de la Plana has a population of around 147000 and a population density of 1346 inhabitants/km2.
Castellón de la Plana is one of the 29 Spanish cities which have benefited from the EU co-financed URBAN I Community initiative.
The URBAN Community Initiative is an instrument within EU Cohesion Policy, dedicated to the regeneration of urban areas and neighbourhoods in crisis.
The project involves the modernisation of an irrigation network in an area of 895 hectares, by changing the existing concrete aqueducts to a system with pumps and underground channels (see also Photo 4).
However, these results are realised in an area which in several aspects are in the most competitive and best-situated parts of the Objective 1 areas of Spain.
Castellón de la Plana, and the agricultural areas next to this town, are not characterised by problems which are typical for rural areas (depopulation, high employment in agriculture, etc.).
Rural development deals with territorial cohesion but includes also other objectives like increasing the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sector, enhancing the environment and the countryside, and improving the wider rural economy both at Community and national/regional level (see reply to paragraphs 6 to 13).
Specific %quot%measure-related%quot% objectives are included for each of the audited measures under the respective Chapters I, VII and IX of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.
The tandem of sectoral and territorial elements is embedded in that policy being considered as the second pillar of the CAP (see reply to paragraphs 16 to 28).
Following the principle of subsidiarity, the identification of beneficiaries and areas eligible for support and the formulation of appropriate strategies is the responsibility of the Member States (see reply to paragraphs 29 to 34).
Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 for the next programming period includes a clearer targeting towards smaller enterprises in processing and marketing of agricultural products (and micro-enterprises for forestry products in axis 1 and for business development in axis 3) in order, inter alia, to limit deadweight effects (if and where they occur) as much as possible (see reply to paragraphs 35 to 39).
Furthermore, efficient spending of the investment measures can not only be brought down to the rural character of the area in which the intervention takes place (see reply to paragraphs 40 to 46).
Monitoring will be strengthened with the introduction of a Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CMEF) for the next programming period in cooperation with the Member States (see reply to paragraphs 55 to 63).
These goals are embedded in the wider rural development approach of increasing competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sector, enhancing the environment and the countryside and improving the wider rural economy (see also reply to paragraphs 19 to 27).
Observation 1 The flexible design of the RD policy allows Member States/regions to define objectives and strategies fitted to their specific situation.
Following the framework provided by the Council for the next period 2007 to 2013 a more strategic approach has been introduced through the Community Strategic Guidelines (CSG) adopted by the Council in February 2006 [1].
Member States shall prepare their national rural development strategies on the basis of six community strategic guidelines, which will help to: - identify the areas where the use of EU support for rural development creates the most value added at EU level, - make the link with the main EU priorities (Lisbon, Gothenburg); - ensure complementarity and coherence between actions financed by the structural, employment and rural development policies on a given territory and in a given field of activity; - accompany the implementation of the new market-orientated CAP and the necessary restructuring it will entail in the old and new Member States.
Text box 1 — Portugal The two examples mentioned by the Court are in line with the objective of increasing incomes and of improving living, working and production conditions.
This is reflected in the current programming period and strengthened in the future period under Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005. 24.
A further spatial differentiation at programme level is the responsibility of the Member States. 25 and 26.
For the next programming period, a minimum funding of 10 % of the total EU contribution has been withheld by the Council Regulation for measures concerning the quality of life and diversification of the rural economy outside agriculture and forestry. 27.
However, to better accentuate the territorial dimension, Member States need to assess the designation of rural areas and their importance in the preparation of their RDPs. 28.
As outlined in paragraphs 24 to 26, the application of some sector-related measures does follow a territorial differentiation already in the current period 2000 to 2006.
Therefore, the definition of rural areas and the identification of areas eligible for intervention as well as the location of the projects within these rural areas is the responsibility of the Member States in function of their needs, objectives and the strategy defined in their programmes.
As mentioned in paragraph 27, for the next programming period Member States need to include in their RDPs the designation of their rural areas and indicate their importance. 30 and 31.
However, the Commission has introduced a more strategic management based on priorities and objectives for the next programming period.
Text box 3 — Spain The practice in Catalonia, described by the Court, of encouraging new applications by increasing the total number of different beneficiaries over time is an incentive to bring European benefits to more people.
Observation 4 The Commission agrees that a lack of targeting increases the risk of deadweight and that a clear focus of the resources by the Member States contributes to the effectiveness of the RD programmes. 35.
Similar measures under the next programming period 2007 to 2013 will have to take account of these conclusions. 37 and 38.
There will be a clear targeting of investment support in the next programming period according to the needs of enterprises.
Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 (EAFRD regulation) targets smaller enterprises in processing and marketing of agricultural products (and micro-enterprises for forestry products in axis 1 and for business development in axis 3) in order, inter alia, to limit deadweight effects as much as possible.
In this specific case, Flanders included the requirement of an income per full-time worker of at least 21577 euro in its RDP based on the analysis of problems at regional level and the resulting objectives and priorities they wish to include in their programme.
Observation 5 The eligibility of support under investments in agricultural holdings and investment in food processing is not restricted to rural areas.
A general finding which can be deducted from this exercise is that very few projects supported by EAGGF Guidance are situated in urban areas (for two out of four benchmarks 22 % and according to the OECD-classification only 9 %), which indicates a territorial dimension in rural development policy. 42.
The calculation presented by the Court includes an estimation based on a set of 300 samples.
There may be cases where forms of support other than investment support fit better to the needs of particular types of rural areas (e.g specific support in LFAs being as a general rule less populated and remote areas). 45.
Observation 6 The effectiveness of spending is measured by comparing the projects with its objectives. 48.
Observation 7 The Commission has undertaken serious efforts to remedy shortcomings in the quantity and quality of the monitoring data of Member States, already for the current programming period.
The list of common indicators included in the monitoring tables is by no means exhaustive.
Member States can add additional indicators which are adapted to their specific needs or to the specific features of their programmes. 59.
The year 2000 was the first year of reporting and mainly atypical since programme approval was still ongoing and the implementation of the measures was still in an early stage. 60.
Table 5 of the monitoring tables, for example, includes a geographic breakdown of financial support and the number of applications approved. 62.
The flexible design of the rural development policy with its variety of measures and objectives does not prevent Member States from setting out clear strategies and objectives in their rural development programmes as is required by Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999. - For the next programming period, a more strategic approach has been introduced through the Community Strategic Guidelines.
However, since agriculture still plays an important role in the economy of rural areas, support to this sector can provide a significant contribution to the development of rural areas. - Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 sets out three core objectives for rural development support for the programming period 2007 to 2013: (1) improving the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry, (2) improving the environment and the countryside, and (3) improving the quality of life in rural areas and encouraging diversification of economic activity.
Therefore, the areas eligible for intervention, as well as the selection and ranking of projects, is the responsibility of the Member States. - With the introduction of the national strategy plans a more targeted approach is foreseen for the next generation of rural development programmes. 67.
On the basis of this information Member States describe the priorities for action and their appropriate strategy. - A further step in the direction of territorial targeting has been incorporated in the next programming period as Member States need to include in their RDPs the designation of their rural areas and indicate their importance. 68.
The Commission agrees that integrated territorial approaches provide an important tool for implementing the rural development policy and has encouraged both in the current and the next programming period the implementation of local development strategies. - The outcomes of the mid-term evaluation reports and the results of the ex-ante evaluations will form an important input into the current and new RDPs.
The Commission has undertaken serious efforts to improve the quality and quantity of the monitoring data of Member States for the current programming period. - The Commission has proposed, in collaboration with the Member States, a new and better Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for the next programming period.
