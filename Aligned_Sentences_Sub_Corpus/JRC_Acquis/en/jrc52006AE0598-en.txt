The increase in aviation's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions will be approximately 50 % of the annual percentage increase in aviation, even if all the ambitious R%amp%D goals are achieved over the coming decades.
Reasons B.1 While the contribution of aviation emissions to climate change is relatively small (around 3 %), it is forecast to grow due to increasing demand, the absence of alternative fuel sources and the relative maturity of current aircraft technology.
B.3 The problem is global in nature and thus demands a global solution.
If the growth continues as up to now, by 2012 emissions from international flights from EU airports will have increased by 150 % since 1990.
Legislative proposals are expected in late 2006. 3.
Countries such as the United States and China, which are responsible for a substantial proportion of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, have opted for innovative at-source measures as the spearhead of their approach and have recently concluded international agreements on the subject. 3.2 The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997 and ratified by Russia, Canada and other countries, as well as the EU, aims for an EU-average reduction of 8 % in greenhouse gases over the period 2008-2012 compared with 1990 levels, with different percentage reductions per Member State.
Brussels, 21 April 2006.
The President of the European Economic and Social Committee Anne-Marie Sigmund [1] Aviation is one of the cleanest and most economical forms of transport.
The transport sector as a whole accounts for about 22 % of all global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use.
The share of aviation is only 12 %.
Consequently, aviation is responsible for only about 2 %-3 % of total global CO2 emissions (12 % of 22 %). --------------------------------------------------
