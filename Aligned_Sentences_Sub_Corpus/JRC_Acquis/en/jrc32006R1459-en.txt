Regulation (EEC) No 1617/93 expired on 30 June 2005. (6) In June 2004 the Commission initiated a consultation on the revision of Regulation (EEC) No 1617/93 to determine whether the block exemption should be discontinued, maintained in its original form or extended in scope.
However, the airline industry should be allowed sufficient time to adapt to the new situation and to assess for themselves whether their agreements and practices are compatible with Article 81 of the Treaty and, if necessary, to amend them.
After 31 December 2006, the airline industry should assess for itself whether agreements and concerted practices between undertakings and decisions of associations of undertakings caught by Article 81(1) of the Treaty satisfy the conditions of Article 81(3).
However, consultations must not exceed the aim of facilitating interlining. (11) The results of the consultation initiated by the Commission in June 2004 for the review of Regulation (EEC) No 1617/93 indicate that the intra-Community air transport market has evolved in such a way that the degree of assurance that consultations on tariffs will continue to meet all the criteria of Article 81(3) of the Treaty is declining. (12) A block exemption should therefore be granted until 31 December 2006 in respect of consultations on tariffs for the carriage of passengers, with their baggage, on scheduled air services between Community airports.
After that date, the airline industry should assess for itself whether agreements and concerted practices between undertakings and decisions of associations of undertakings caught by Article 81(1) of the Treaty satisfy the conditions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty. (13) Since 1 May 2004, the Commission has been empowered to apply Article 81(3) of the Treaty by Regulation in respect of air services on routes between the Community and third countries, as well as on routes between Community airports. (14) In contrast to intra-Community air-traffic, air services between Member States and third countries are, in general, governed by bilateral air services agreements.
A short block exemption should therefore be granted in respect of such consultations until 31 October 2007. (17) The competent authorities in the United States of America and Australia are reviewing their respective antitrust policies in respect of IATA tariff conferences.
