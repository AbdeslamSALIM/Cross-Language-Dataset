These measures could also be supplemented by other non-discriminatory instruments such as capacity payments. (11) In order to ensure that appropriate prior information is available, Member States should publish measures taken to maintain the balance between supply and demand among actual and potential investors in generation and among electricity consumers. (12) Without prejudice to Articles 86, 87 and 88 of the Treaty, it is important for Member States to lay down an unambiguous, appropriate and stable framework which will facilitate security of electricity supply and is conducive to investments in generation capacity and demand management techniques.
It is also important that appropriate measures are taken to ensure a regulatory framework that encourages investment in new transmission interconnection, especially between Member States. (13) The European Council in Barcelona on 15 and 16 March 2002 agreed on a level of interconnection between Member States.
In this way, it could be possible to make better use of existing capacity, and no false shortage signals will be given to the market, which will support the achievement of a fully competitive internal market as envisaged in Directive 2003/54/EC. (15) Transmission and distribution system operators need an appropriate and stable regulatory framework for investment, and for maintenance and renewal of the networks. (16) Article 4 of Directive 2003/54/EC requires Member States to monitor and submit a report on security of electricity supply.
In compiling such a report, Member States will be expected to refer to information and assessments already being undertaken by transmission system operators both on an individual and collective basis, including at European level. (17) Member States should ensure the effective implementation of this Directive. (18) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely secure electricity supplies based on fair competition and the creation of a fully operational internal electricity market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
