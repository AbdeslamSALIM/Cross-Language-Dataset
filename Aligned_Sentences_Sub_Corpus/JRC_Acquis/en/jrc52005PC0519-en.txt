Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION on the conclusion of an Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Community and the United States of America on matters related to trade in wine . (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM On 23 October 2000 the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate an agreement on trade in wine between the European Community and the United States of America.
These derogations will expire on 31 December 2005.
Articles 4 and 9 of the Agreement will continue to treat wines originating in the United States in the same way but, according to Article 17(2) of the Agreement, these provisions will only apply from the first day of the second month following receipt of the written notice referred to in Article 6(3) of the Agreement.
Therefore it was necessary to negotiate a separate agreement in the form of an exchange of letters to cover the period from 31 December 2005 until the date of application of Articles 4 and 9 of the Agreement.
Article 3 The Commission is hereby authorised to adopt the necessary acts for implementation of the Agreement, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 75(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, including any necessary prolongation of the derogation provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1037/2001.
