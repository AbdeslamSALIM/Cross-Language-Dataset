Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social committee and the Committee of the Regions on enhancing supply chain security /* COM/2006/0079 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 27.2.2006 COM(2006)79 final 2006/0025(COD) COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS on enhancing supply chain security Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on enhancing supply chain security (SEC(2006)251) . (presented by the Commission) COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS on enhancing supply chain security 1.
Recently considerable improvements have been made to transport security in Europe: aviation and airport security have been given a European framework[1], maritime and port terminal security have been strengthened[2], and security within the entire port areas can be expected to improve considerably following the recent completion of the legislative process on security measures for seaports[3]. 1.4.
The Commission therefore proposes Community action to enhance the security in the land transport supply chain to complement existing Community transport security rules.
Towards improving supply chain security 2.1.
The objectives of the Commission’s proposal are: - to increase the level of security along the supply chain without impeding the free flow of trade; - to establish a common framework for a systematic European approach without jeopardising the common transport market and existing security measures; - to avoid unnecessary administrative procedures and burdens at European and national levels. 2.5.
They are used to security arrangements. 3.3.
Yet an increasing number of companies are establishing their own security management standards not only to protect their own operations and brand but also as a tool for selecting their partners in the supply chain. 3.5.
This point is relevant because the supply chain consists of a considerable number of operators. 3.15.
In order to maintain the integrity of the common market, each Member State will have to recognise the “secure operator” status awarded by any other Member State, when the “secure operator” does business on its territory. 3.27.
Europe-wide recognition of a “secure operator” status awarded by a national authority has advantages for the operators and the Member States: the operator will benefit from recognition throughout the EU.
After all, with the common market for supply chain operators a reality, every national authority will be confronted with operators having been granted “secure operator” status in another Member State expecting to be allowed to avail themselves of facilitations granted to national operators.
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
The open consultation was conducted over the internet from 23 December 2003 to 27 February 2004.
The Commission received 65 responses.
The proposal complements other transport security measures already in place.
The measures required for enhancing land transport supply chain security would follow these principles: - supply chain security requires an active security partnership between Member State authorities and industry; - supply chain security complements transport security measures already in place in the fields of aviation and maritime transport, including airports and seaports; - an obligation for Member States to set up a national scheme to increase supply chain security which are compatible with each other; - a voluntary framework for operators setting minimum requirements with which operators in four identified categories of supply chain operations must comply in order to be awarded the “secure operator” status; - “Secure operators” should benefit from “fast track treatment” security facilitations and simplification of customs controls, and will enjoy enhanced standing with their commercial partners; - Member States must designate a competent authority for supply chain security for granting “secure operator” status.
Additional information - European Economic Area The proposed act is of EEA relevance and should therefore extend to the European Economic Area. - Detailed explanation of the proposal The Commission proposes to base the Regulation on Article 71 of the EC Treaty without prejudice to Member States’ national security legislation and any measures that might be taken on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union.
Article 4 This article imposes on Member States the obligation to designate a competent authority for supply chain security.
Article 5: This article imposes on Member States the obligation to establish a national scheme to grant “secure operator” status to supply chain operators.
Article 7: This article imposes the obligation of mutual recognition between Member States.
Article 10: This article places an obligation on Member States to set up award procedures, either directly through a public authority or through recognised organisations for supply chain security, and to make the list of “secure operators” accessible to national authorities, focal points and the Commission.
Article 11: This article provides for appointing a focal point for supply chain security as the contact point for Member States and the Commission.
Member States may introduce higher requirements for operators established on their territory. (12) A “secure operator” scheme would provide advantages for authorities and commercial operators. (13) A “secure operator” scheme would allow authorities responsible for security to concentrate their control resources on those operators not ready to meet minimum security requirements and to do so in the context of a common Europe-wide security drive. (14) The “secure operator” status shall be recognised throughout the European Union. (15) Member States should grant “secure operators” facilitations in the area of security controls plus simplifications of security controls at external borders, including where available, the use of “fast track treatment”, without losing the right to carry out security controls on “secure operators”. (16) “Secure operators” would furthermore be able to demonstrate to the market their ability to keep the supply chain free of security breaches, to distinguish themselves positively from other operators and to establish a positive trend in business security performance. (17) Member States should ensure that a list of “secure operators” is made accessible to other Member States’ authorities and the Commission. (18) “Secure operator” status should be recognized throughout the European Union but could be withdrawn by the Member State which awarded it if the operator were found to be in serious breach of the conditions under which it was awarded.
A Member State may refuse to grant facilitations and simplification where it finds that a “secure operator” which has been awarded this status by another Member State is in breach of the minimum security requirements. (19) Member States could appoint recognised organisations for supply chain security for the purpose of assessing whether an applicant “secure operator” meets the required conditions. (20) Member States should appoint a competent authority for supply chain security. (21) Member States should ensure that a focal point assumes the role of contact point between the Commission and the Member States. (22) Member States should monitor implementation among supply chain operators. (23) The measures needed to implement this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[23].
Therefore, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
