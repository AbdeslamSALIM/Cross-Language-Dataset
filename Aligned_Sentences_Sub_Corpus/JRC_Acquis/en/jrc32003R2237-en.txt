The same provisions shall apply for the reduction of the total amount of individual reference quantities in case of application of Article 95(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. (7) According to Article 73 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, granting of the specific quality premium for durum wheat is subject to the use of certain quantities of certified seeds of varieties recognised, in the production zone, as being of high quality for the production of semolina or pasta.
In order to ensure that those requirements are respected, the criteria for the variety screening method in each Member States should be fixed and the procedure for the establishment of the eligible varieties list as well as the minimum quantity of certified seeds to be used should be fixed. (8) The short time between the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and the entry into force of the specific quality premium for durum wheat makes it impossible to establish a list of eligible varieties for the granting of the aid in the years 2004 and 2005 according to the envisaged screening method.
It is therefore necessary for Member States to establish a transitional list based on a selection of current varieties. (9) In view of the obligation, for the purpose of the eligibility to the specific quality premium for durum wheat, to use a certain quantity of certified seeds, an appropriate control procedure should be set up in order to verify that the eligible seeds and the required quantities are effectively used. (10) In some regions, the protein crops are traditionally sown in a mixture with cereals for agronomical reasons.
In order to facilitate the transition between the existing improvement plans which expire later than the introduction of the new aid scheme, it is appropriate to provide for transitional measures. (12) The terms of payment as well as the crop-specific payment for rice calculation depend not only on the base area or areas fixed for each producing Member State fixed by Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, but also on the possible subdivision of those base areas into subbase areas and on the objective criteria chosen by each Member State to perform this subdivision, on conditions in which the cultivated parcels are put into cultivation and on the minimum size of the latter.
As a consequence, detailed rules should be set for the establishment, the management and the cultivation modalities applicable to base areas and subbase areas. (13) The observation of a possible overrun of the base area referred to in Article 82 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 implies a reduction of the crop-specific payment for rice.
That Regulation becomes without object and should therefore be repealed. (16) Articles 93 and 94 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provide for an aid to farmers producing potatoes intended for the manufacture of potato starch subject to a cultivation contract and within the quota limit established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 of 27 July 1994 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch(5).
In the interest of efficiency and good management of the aid scheme, provisions on checks should be provided for. (17) Articles 95 and 96 Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provide that the dairy premium and additional payment are paid to producers.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing a levy in the milk and milk products sector(6) provides for specific provisions in case of inactivity.
In the interest of efficiency and good management of the aid scheme, provisions on checks should be provided for. (18) Articles 88 to 92 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provide for a new aid scheme for energy crops to be granted to farmers.
Article 2 Application of the integrated administration and control system Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 and Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001 shall apply to the applications, for the calendar year 2004, for direct payments referred to in Article 1(a) to (e), save as otherwise provided.

For the calendar year 2004, Articles 2(r), 4, 22 and 23 of Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001 shall apply to the applications for direct payments referred to in Article 1(f).
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001 shall only apply with regard to area-related aid applications.
The direct payment referred to in Article 1(a), (b), (c) and (e) shall be granted only for the areas, per each type of crop, which have been the subject of application in respect of at least 0,3 hectare, where each cultivated parcel exceeds the minimum size set by the Member State within the limit set up in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001. 2.
The direct payment referred to in Article 1(a), (b) and (c) shall be granted only for the areas entirely sown and on which all normal cultivation conditions have been performed in accordance with local standards.
Without prejudice to the time period provided for in Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, direct payments under this Regulation shall be paid after the checks made pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001 and this Regulation are carried out. 4.
However, any cultivated parcel which is covered in respect of the same year by an application for: (a) specific quality premium for durum wheat provided for in Title IV Chapter 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 or protein crop premium provided for in Title IV Chapter 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 may be the subject of an application for arable crops payments referred to in Articles 2, 4 and 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999(10) or in Title IV Chapter 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003; (b) crop-specific payment for rice provided for in Title IV Chapter 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 or protein crop premium provided for in Title IV Chapter 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 may be the subject of an application for seed aid referred to in Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71(11) or in Title IV Chapter 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003; (c) aid for energy crops provided for in Title IV Chapter 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 may be the subject of an application for arable crops payments referred to in Articles 2, 4 and 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 or in Title IV Chapter 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, without prejudice to the second subparagraph of Article 90 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 or crop-specific payment for rice provided for in Title IV Chapter 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003; (d) arable crops payments referred to in Articles 2, 4 and 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 or in Title IV Chapter 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 may be the subject of an application for seed aid referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 or in Title IV Chapter 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
