The indexing procedures referred to in point 2 shall follow the technical provisions set out in point 5, in order to detect at least the following harmful organisms: - Bacteria (a) Clavibacter michiganensis (Smith) Davis et al ssp.
The plant material subjected to the visual inspections referred to in point 2 and on which signs and symptoms of harmful organisms have been observed, shall be subjected to an investigation including testing where necessary, to determine as far as possible, the identity of the harmful organisms causing the signs and symptoms. 5.
The technical provisions referred to in point 3 shall be as follows: -Bacteria 1.
The standard sample size shall be 200 tubers.
However, the procedure can be applied conveniently for samples with less than 200 tubers. 2.

For the material referred to in point 2, this testing method could be applied. - Viruses and virus-like organisms, other than potato spindle tuber viroid 1.
The serological and biological testings referred to in points 1 and 2 shall be done on glasshouse grown plants, sampled from at least two positions on every stem, including a young fully expanded leaflet at the top of each stem and an older leaflet from a midway position; each stem shall be sampled because of possible non-systemic infection.
Testing shall be by radioactive or non-radioactive labeled cDNA or RNA-probes, return-PAGE (with silver staining) or RT-PCR. 5.
Use of this or higher bulking rates must be validated.` Article 2 1.
