Proposal for a Council Decision adapting the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania as regards rural development /* COM/2006/0152 final - CNS 2006/0053 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 4.4.2006 COM(2006) 152 final 2006/0053 (CNS) 2006/0054 (CNS) Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION adapting the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania as regards rural development Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION adapting Annex VIII to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM On 20 September 2005 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development which makes changes to the acquis on which the accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania were based.
Specifically, there is a need to: - adapt the rural development-related annexes of the Act of Accession so that the negotiation results are compatible with the new acquis (where references in the Act of Accession have become obsolete or where the negotiation results are not immediately compatible with the new rural development regulation); - adapt articles 29 and 34 of the Act of Accession insofar as they refer to transitional and implementing rules for rural development; - adapt the new rural development regulation so that it can be applied to Bulgaria and Romania and so that it incorporates as appropriate the accession negotiation results.
LEADER – Minimum financial threshold for axis 4 Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 establishes that within each rural development programme there must be a compulsory Leader axis to support locally designed and implemented rural development strategies, and that this axis must account for a minimum percentage of the EAFRD contribution to the programme.
Given the lack of experience of Bulgaria and Romania in implementing the Leader approach and in order to build sufficient local capacity to apply Leader, the average financial contribution of 2.5% for the Leader axis applicable to the EU-10 should be applied for the period 2010–2013 only for Bulgaria and Romania.
The references in the procedural provisions provided for in the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania should be adapted accordingly. (4) When reaching political agreement on Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, the Council and the Commission agreed in a joint declaration regarding Bulgaria and Romania to extend the measure on advisory services provided for in Annex VIII to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania until 2013 as regards the provision of advisory services to farmers receiving semi-subsistence support.
Article 3 This Decision shall take effect on 1 January 2007 subject to the entry into force of the Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
Moreover, the adaptations to the Act of Accession should be limited to what is absolutely necessary. (4) The “semi-subsistence” and “producer group” measures provided for in Annex VIII to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania are covered by Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 as amended by Regulation (EC) No …/2006, as transitional measures for Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia.
In addition, Article 59 of that Regulation establishes a measure aimed at supporting capacity building, which differs from the arrangements that were negotiated for Bulgaria and Romania.
So as to avoid, notably, double financing, for the three first years of the programme, Bulgaria and Romania should be given the choice of implementing either the measure provided for in Annex VIII to the Act of Accession or the measure provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005. (8) Furthermore, when reaching political agreement on Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, the Council and the Commission have agreed in a joint declaration regarding Bulgaria and Romania to extend the measure on advisory services provided for in Annex VIII to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania until 2013 as regards the provision of advisory services to farmers receiving semi-subsistence support.
For this reason, that support should not be taken into account for the calculation of the balance between objectives described in Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005. (11) Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 no longer includes economic viability as an eligibility condition of the measure concerning investment support.
In addition, there is a need to modify in that Annex the financial contribution of the Community for agri-environment and animal welfare measures since, in accordance with Article 70 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, the co-financing rates are no longer set at measure but at axis level, HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: Article 1 Annex VIII to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania is amended as follows: (1) Section I is amended as follows: (a) points A and B are deleted; (b) point C is replaced by the following: “C.
For the period 2007–2009, that support cannot be included in the rural development programme if support as provided for in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 is foreseen. (2) For the period 2010–2013, support shall be granted only for the provision of services to farmers receiving semi-subsistence support as referred to in Article 20(d)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.
Article 3 This Decision shall take effect on 1 January 2007 subject to the entry into force of the Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
