The promotion of a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment is therefore necessary. – Equally, as one of the major energy consumers transport must contribute to ensuring energy security. – In the social area, the EU policy promotes employment quality improvement and better qualifications for European transport workers. – EU policy also protects European citizens as users and providers of transport services, both as consumers and in terms of their safety and, more recently, their security. – innovate in support of the first two aims of mobility and protection by increasing the efficiency and sustainability of the growing transport sector.
EU policies develop and bring to market tomorrow’s innovative solutions that are energy efficient or use alternative energy sources or support mature, large intelligent transport projects, such as Galileo; – connect internationally, projecting the Union’s policies to reinforce sustainable mobility, protection and innovation, by participating in the international organisations.
Evolving context While the objectives remain stable over time, the general context of EU transport policy has evolved: · Enlargement has given the EU a continental dimension.
The Union of 25, soon to be 27, is more diverse.
Whereas pollution, land use and congestion are of major concern in the densely populated and industrialised “midwest”, for other Member States accessibility is still the key concern.
The diversity may in certain policy areas require more differentiated solutions, leaving room for local, regional and national solutions whilst ensuring a Europe-wide internal transport market. · The transport industry has changed.
Transport accounts for 30% of total energy consumption in the EU.
With 98% dependency on oil, high oil prices influence the transport sector and stimulate improved energy efficiency, diversified supply solutions and policies to affect demand, all supported by new, innovative technologies. · The international context has also changed in other ways.
Since 2001, major legislative proposals were approved and are being put into practice such as the opening-up of rail freight transport to competition, the upgraded social conditions of road transport, the definition of 30 TEN priority projects, the creation of the European Single Sky, the strengthening of aviation passenger rights, the new road charging directive whose distance-based user charges can be channelled to the financing of infrastructure in some cases, the promotion of intermodal transport with the Marco Polo programme and the reinforcement of the legal framework in maritime safety.
Overall, rail freight transport grew by 6% in 1995-2004.
Inland waterways transport showed strong growth in the last decade in certain Member States (50% in Belgium; 30% in France).
Whereas the 2001 White Paper assumed an average economic growth rate of 3%, the actual outcome in the period 2000-2005 was 1.8%.
For the period between 2000 and 2020, forecasts establish the average annual GDP growth rate at 2.1% (52% for the whole period).
For example, greenhouse gas emissions from air transport have grown by over 4% per year in the last decade.
Road fatalities have declined by more than 17% since 2001, although not in all Member States.
In this area, a continuation of the 2001 White Paper measures and the eSafety Initiative [13] are expected in the medium term to produce significant benefits towards the headline goal of cutting fatalities by half.
Cabotage, the carriage of goods within one country by a haulier from another country, accounts for 1.2% of national road transport markets.
Restructuring and adaptions have necessitated a number of socially difficult decisions and have led to a marked reduction of employment in the sector.
Enlargement opens further long-distance (over 500 km) rail links which, combined with efficient logistics operations may compete with road transport to provide environmentally friendly door-to-door service.
It can help to alleviate congestion and environmental pressure on other modes, provided pollutant emissions from shipping are reduced.
The Commission will build on the debate set in motion by the Green Paper on a future EU maritime policy [17] to develop an integrated maritime transport strategy around a “common European maritime space”.
The NAIADES programme sets out an action plan for promoting river transport. [18] Action: build on a broad public consultation of stakeholders to develop a comprehensive strategy for a “common European maritime space”; develop a comprehensive European ports policy; action to reduce pollutant emissions from waterborne transport; continue to promote short sea shipping and motorways of the sea, with particular emphasis on landward connections; implement the NAIADES action plan for river transport. 4.
Urban transport accounts for 40% of CO2 emissions of road transport and up to 70% of other pollutants from transport.
The EU can promote the study and exchange of best practice across the EU in areas such as transport infrastructure, norm-setting, congestion and traffic management, public transport services, infrastructure charging, urban planning, safety, security and cooperation with the surrounding regions.
By 2020, 60 major airports are expected to become severely congested; a similar trend is visible in ports.
The outermost regions suffer from a strong accessibility deficit not only in relation to the continental internal market but also in their own hinterland.
However, the public financing capacities of the Member States remain constrained; the level of investment in transport infrastructure has fallen in all Member States and now amounts to less than 1 % of GDP.
The Marco Polo programme, with a budget of € 450 million until 2013, will contribute directly to offering alternatives in other modes of transport to operators on congested roads.
The Galileo Supervisory Authority is being set up; the Galileo satellite system will be operational from 2010 and provide navigation signals to be combined with ground- or space-based communication.
The EU is investing considerable public funds in these systems and accompanies their roll-out with the necessary regulatory framework.
Transport equipment accounts for 16% of EU exports.
Conclusion: a renewed agenda 1992 was the completion date of the Internal Market; for transport it was very much the starting date.
Successive enlargements have helped strengthen and consolidate this position.
Whereas future policies will continue to be based on the White Papers of 1992 and 2001, in many areas European intervention will not suffice.
The future actions, including the implementation of actions already announced in the 2001 White Paper and not yet followed up, will be based on a broad dialogue with all stakeholders concerned.
