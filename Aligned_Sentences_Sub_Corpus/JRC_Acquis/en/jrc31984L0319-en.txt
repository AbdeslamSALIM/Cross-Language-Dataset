METHOD USING THE ARTIFICIAL DIGESTION OF COLLECTIVE SAMPLES (a) Apparatus and reagents - knife and tweezers for collecting specimens, - meat mincer with 2 to 3 mm diameter perforations, - a 3 litre Erlenmeyer flask with a rubber or cotton-wool plug, - a conical separation funnel of 2 000 ml capacity, - an ordinary A-base stand of approximately 28 cm length with an 80 cm stem, - a ring, diameter approximately 10 to 11 cm which can be fixed to the stand, - a clamp with a flat vice (23 × 40 mm) which can be attached to the stand by means of a double coupling, - a sieve (mesh size 177 microns) with an external diameter of 11 cm fitted with brass or stainless steel mesh, - a funnel with an internal diameter of not less than 12 cm, - 100 ml glass measuring cylinders, - a stereo-microscope (magnification 15 to 40×) with a suitable light source, or a trichinoscope with horizontal table for the compressor with suitable light source, - when using the trichinoscope: a larval counting basin is used which may be described as follows: the larval counting basin is made from 3 mm thick acrylic plates, as follows: (i) the bottom of the basin to be 180 × 40 mm, marked off into squares, (ii) the sides to be 230 × 20 mm, (iii) the end to be 40 × 20 mm.
The bottom and the ends should be inserted between the sides, thus forming a basin with two small handles in both ends.
The upper side of the bottom should be raised 7 to 9 mm from the base of the frame formed by the sides and the ends.
The minced meat shall be placed in the 3 litre Erlenmeyer flask together with 7 g of pepsin, approximately 2 litres of tap-water heated to about 40 to 41 °C and 25 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid.
The pH of the solution will be about 1,5 to 2. - For digestion, the Erlenmeyer flask shall be incubated at 40 to 41 °C for approximately four hours.
The flask shall be regularly shaken during the time of incubation, at least twice every hour. - The digested solution shall be filtered through the sieve into the conical 2 litre separation funnel and left undisturbed on the stand for at least one hour. - A total volume of approximately 45 ml should be run off into a measuring cylinder and divided between three Petri dishes, the bottoms of which should be marked off into squares, with 15 ml in each dish. - Each Petri dish shall be minutely examined for larval trichinae under the stereo-microscope. - Where larval counting basins are employed, the 45 ml shall be distributed between two larval counting basins and examined under the trichinoscope.
After a further settling period of 10 minutes, 30 ml of supernatant fluid is removed by suction and the remaining 15 ml is poured into a Petri dish or larval counting basin for examination.
If more than 15 samples and less than 100 samples are examined, the digestion fluid should be reduced proportionately. 2.
In the case of a positive or doubtful result following the examination of a collective sample, a further 20 g sample should be taken from each pig in accordance with (b) above.
The 20 g samples from five pigs should be pooled and examined by the method described above.
In this way samples from 20 groups of five pigs will be examined.
When trichinellae are detected in a pooled sample from five pigs, further 20 g samples should be collected from the individual pigs in the group and each should separately be examined using the method described above.' 3.
THE MECHANICALLY ASSISTED POOLED SAMPLE DIGESTION METHOD/SEDIMENTATION TECHNIQUE (a) Apparatus and reagents - knife or scissors for cutting specimens, - trays marked off with 50 squares each of which can hold samples of approximately 2 g of meat, - a Stomacher Lab-blender 3 500 Thermo model, - plastic bags suitable for the Stomacher Lab-blender, - conical separation funnels of 2 litre capacity, preferably fitted with teflon safety plugs, - stands, rings and clamps, - sieves, mesh size 177 microns, external diameter 11 cm with stainless steel mesh, - funnels with an internal diameter not less than 12 cm, to support the sieves, - 100 ml glass measuring cylinders, - a 25 ml dispenser, - beakers of 3 litre capacity, - spoon or glass rod for stirring the digestion fluid in the beaker, - a plastic syringe and tube for suction, - a measuring spoon for 6 g, - a thermometer accurate to ± 0,5 °C within the range 1 to 100 °C, - a vibrator, e.g.
The upper side of the bottom should be raised 7 to 9 mm from the base of the frame formed by the sides and the ends.
for 30 samples the volume required is 30 × 15 ml or 450 ml) and transferred to the inner of the two plastic bags together with the meat samples of approximately 1 g (at 25 to 30 °C) taken from each of the individual samples in accordance with (b). - Water at a temperature of approximately 41 °C is poured into the outer bag to a total volume in the two bags of one and a half litres. - The Stomacher is then allowed to pound the content of the bag for 25 minutes. - The plastic bag is then removed from the Stomacher and the digestion fluid is filtered through the sieve into a 3 litre beaker. - The plastic bag is washed with approximately 100 ml of water, which is then used to rinse the sieve and finally added to the filtrate in the beaker. 2.
The length of the tube should be such that 15 ml will remain in the measuring cylinder when the flanges of the syringe rest on the cylinder's rim. - The remaining 15 ml is poured into a larval counting basin or two Petri dishes and examined using a trichinoscope or stereo-microscope respectively. - Digests should be examined as soon as they are ready.
After a further settling period of 10 minutes, 30 ml of supernatant fluid is removed by suction and the remaining 15 ml is poured into a Petri dish or larval counting basin for examination.
The measuring cylinder should be washed with 10 ml of tap-water and these washings should be added to the sample in the Petri dish or the larval counting basin for examination. 3.
In the case of a positive or doubtful result, following the examination of a collective sample, a further 20 g sample should be taken from each pig in accordance with (b) above.
The 20 g samples from five pigs should be pooled and examined by the method described above.
In this way, samples from 20 groups of five pigs will be examined.
When trichinellae are detected in a pooled sample from five pigs, further 20 g samples should be collected from the individual pigs in the group and each should separately be examined using the method described above.
The bag is washed out with 5 to 10 ml of water which is then added to the larval counting basin for examination by trichinoscope or to the Petri dish for examination by stereo-microscope. - Digests should be examined as soon as they are ready.
Filter discs can be cleaned by leaving them in rennilase solution overnight.
In the case of a positive or doubtful result, following the examination of a collective sample, a further 20 g sample should be taken from each pig in accordance with (b) above.
The 20 g samples from five pigs should be pooled and examined by the method described above.
In this way, samples from 20 groups of five pigs will be examined.
When trichinellae are detected in a pooled sample from five pigs, further 20 g samples should be collected from the individual pigs in the group and each should separately be examined using the method described above.
The upper side of the bottom should be raised 7 to 9 mm from the base of the frame formed by the sides and the ends.
During the stirring process, the digestion fluid should rotate at a sufficiently high speed to create a deep whirl without splashing. - The digestion fluid is stirred for 30 minutes, at the end of which the stirrer is switched off and the digestion fluid is poured through the sieve into the sedimentation funnel. - The digestion fluid is allowed to stand in the funnel for 30 minutes. - After 30 minutes, a 40 ml sample of digestion fluid is quickly run off into the measuring cylinder or centrifuge tube. - The 40 ml sample is allowed to stand for 10 minutes, at the end of which time 30 ml of supernatant is withdrawn by suction, leaving a volume of 10 ml. - The remaining 10 ml sample of sediment is poured into a larval counting basin or Petri dish. - Then the cylinder or centrifuge tube is rinsed with about 10 ml of tap-water which has to be added to the sample in the larval counting basin or Petri dish.
This volume is made up to 40 ml with tap-water.
After a further settling period of 10 minutes, 30 ml of the supernatant fluid is withdrawn by suction leaving a volume of 10 ml for examination in a Petri dish or larval counting basin.
The measuring cylinder should be washed with 10 ml of tap-water and these washings should be added to the sample in the Petri dish or the larval counting basin for examination.
More than 15 samples should be examined as a complete pool.
