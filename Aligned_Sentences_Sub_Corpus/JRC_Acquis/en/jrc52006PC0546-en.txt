COMMENTS ON THE COMMON POSITION The Council made some substantive changes relative to the Commission's proposal (as amended by the Commission's Amended proposal of 20 January 2006) that are for the most part acceptable because they will help ensure that the Recommendation's aims are ultimately achieved.
CONCLUSION The Council accepted in full, in part or in principle, as did the Commission in its amended proposal, amendments 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37 and 38.
Furthermore, the Council has followed the line taken by the Commission in its amended proposal and did not include amendments 3, 5, 13, 27, 32 and 34 in its common position.
The Commission considers that the common position, adopted on 18 September 2006 by a qualified majority, respects to a large extent the objectives, and the approach of its own proposal, and that the Council has taken due account of the European Parliament's concerns and priorities and was able to accept most of Parliament's amendments.
