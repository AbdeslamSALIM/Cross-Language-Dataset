Pleas in law and main arguments In the view of the Commission, the exemption from customs duties unilaterally granted by Italy during the period preceding the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 150/2003 [1] amounted to an unlawful derogation from Article 26 EC and from Community customs legislation, resulting in an unjustifiable reduction in customs revenue, which constitutes the Community's own resources.
Despite the applicant's repeated requests, the Italian Government has refused to calculate and pay to the Community the amounts corresponding to the own resources consequently evaded during the period between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002, and to pay default interest on the said amounts, as laid down by the legislation in force in this area.
