Its southern limit is bounded by parts of the Penibética mountain range, which separate it from the Montes de Málaga, Hoyas in Valle del Guadalhorce and Serranía de Ronda, all districts of the province of Málaga.
This area comprises all the land in the following municipalities of the province of Málaga: Alameda, Almargen, Antequera, Archidona, Campillos, Cañete La Real, Cuevas Bajas, Cuevas de San Marcos, Fuente de Piedra, Humilladero, Mollina, Sierra de Yeguas, Teba, Villanueva de Algaidas, Villanueva del Rosario, Villanueva del Trabuco and Villanueva de Tapia, and the municipality of Palenciana in the province of Córdoba.
The oil is obtained from mills in the production area which are also registered for the PDO.
Method of production: The trees are planted in rows, in blocks usually measuring between 8 m × 8 m and 12 m × 12 m, and the number of scions per tree is generally 3, although this varies between 1 and 4.
The olives are always transported to the mill in bulk, in trailers or rigid containers.
They are milled in registered mills no later than 48 hours after being harvested.
The temperature at which the pomace obtained is milled is kept below 36 °C at all times.
The process of decanting the oils takes not less than 6 hours (when centrifuging) or 36 hours (when decanting by gravity).
The extra virgin olive oil is stored in warehouses, in stainless steel tanks, presses or lined steel tanks suitable for storing foodstuffs.
The olives are grown between 450 and 600 metres above sea level, on medium-depth very limy soil (20-70 % carbonate of lime).
What is more, because the surrounding area drains into the Antequera Depression, various different levels of river terrace have developed, all bearing large quantities of tertiary deposits, including Middle Pliocene red clay, which provide the olive trees with plentiful amounts of potassium and have high levels of moisture retention, promoting vegetation in the olive trees, which is useful given that more than 90 % of the plantation land is not irrigated.
Hojiblanca, the main variety (accounting for over 90 % of the olives grown in the area), is perfectly adapted to these environmental conditions.
Similar Ordinances from 1598 were found in another municipality in the area, Archidona.
In 1679 there were 2400 ha of olive groves and 61 oil mills in the municipality of Antequera, according to the land register of Father Francisco Cabrera of the Order of Saint Augustine.
The foundries set up by his successors (Luna, Alcaide, Herrera and Rodas), which specialised in making this type of machinery, supplied southern Spain with large numbers of olive mills and olive oil factories in the early years of the 20th century.
