Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for a Council Decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, in accordance with Article 128 of the EC Treaty (COM(2005) 141 final — 2005/0057 (CNS)) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for a Council Decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, in accordance with Article 128 of the EC Treaty (COM(2005) 141 final — 2005/0057 (CNS)) (2005/C 286/08) On 22 April 2005 the Council decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 128 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned proposal.
Introduction The European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005 stated the need to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy and to refocus priorities on to growth and employment.
This opinion refers to the part entitled Proposal for a Council Decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, in accordance with Article 128 of the EC Treaty.
Member States should set national employment rate targets for 2008 and 2010 (Integrated guideline No 16)." 3.1.1 In its opinion on Employment policy: the role of the EESC following the enlargement of the EU and from the point of view of the Lisbon Process [3], the EESC recalled that: It is clear that the employment targets cannot be met unless we succeed in ushering in a sustainable economic upswing.
Ensure inclusive labour markets for job-seekers and disadvantaged people through: active and preventive labour market measures including early identification of needs, job search assistance, guidance and training as part of personalised action plans, provision of social services necessary to support the labour market inclusion of disadvantaged people and contribute to social and territorial cohesion and to the eradication of poverty; and continuous review of tax and benefit systems, including the management and conditionality of benefits and reduction of high marginal effective tax rates, with a view to making work pay and to ensuring adequate levels of social protection (Integrated guideline No 18)". 3.3.1 However, as already stated in its opinion on Employment policy guidelines in 2003 [6], the EESC emphasises that "…the term 'at a disadvantage' … covers many groups of people facing various employment situations.
The Committee also emphasises that the macro-economic measures required by guideline number 4 and set out in detail in line 20 have a significant human and economic cost, which the Commission should evaluate more thoroughly in an impact assessment before these guidelines come into force.
