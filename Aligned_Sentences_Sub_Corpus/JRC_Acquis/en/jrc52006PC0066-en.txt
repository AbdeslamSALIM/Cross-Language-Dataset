Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning structural business statistics /* COM/2006/0066 final - COD 2006/0020 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 20.2.2006 COM(2006) 66 final 2006/0020 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL concerning structural business statistics (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal In order to respond to increased need for statistical data to underpin policy making and monitoring, the proposed regulation improves the current regulation by increasing coverage of service activities, by adding annexes on Business Demography and Business Services and by introducing a new tool to respond to emerging user needs.
For example, in Council Regulation No 58/97, manufacturing industry is covered by 241 distinct activities compared to 32 for market services.
This regulation has been amended substantively by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 410/98 of 16 February 1998 (OJ L 52, 21.2.1998, p. 1), Commission Regulation (EC) No 1614/2002 of 6 September 2002 (OJ L 244, 12.9.2002, p. 7), Regulation (EC) No 2056/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002, (OJ L 317, 21.11.2002, p. 1), Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 September 2003, (OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1).
This proposal for a regulation replaces Council Regulation No 58/97 and its amendments and proposes new amendments.
The Council meeting in March 2001 in Stockholm subsequently stated that "the creation of an effectively functioning internal market in services is one of Europe's highest priorities".
In addition, the Commission has, on 6 April 2005, adopted a proposal for a new Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme 2007-2013 (COM (2005) 0121 final).
The need for a clearly prioritised approach within the area of services statistics was underlined as well as the need to identify negative priorities in other fields in order to be able to comply with the requests for new statistics in the area of services and to balance this by a reduction of the response burden in other sectors.
Annex VIII is in general supported by Member States.
An ad hoc module for the flexible conduct of surveys in response to newly emerging statistical needs has been introduced.
The extension of the common module to NACE division 90 (Sewage and refuse disposal, sanitation and similar activities) and groups 92.1 (Motion picture and video activities) and 92.2 (Radio and television activities) and the planned pilot studies for sections M (Education), N (Health and social work) and O (Other community, social and personal service activities) found support in general, however, data for non-market activities were seen as difficult to collect.
In order to fulfil the requirement to, wherever possible, simplify and reduce the burden, the following variables have been deleted in agreement with data providers and users: - Research and development, - Purchases of energy products from Annexes II and IV, - Trading by enterprises from Annex III, - Value of tangible goods acquired through financial leasing from Annexes II to IV, - All optional variables. - All variables that are either surveyed in the framework of another regulation or where data availability or quality was poor and user needs were limited.
As the quality of the data was seen as possibly too low by some Member States, paragraph 4 has been added to article 6 of the main body of the regulation in order to allow for delivery of data flagged for low accuracy in specific cases.
The information provided for under existing Regulation on structural business statistics or under any other Community legislation or available in Member States is insufficient, inadequate or insufficiently comparable to serve as a reliable basis for the work of the Commission. | Legal basis Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof. | Subsidiarity principle The subsidiarity principle applies insofar as the proposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the Community. | The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States for the following reason(s). | Community legislation of structural business statistics is needed to set common statistical standards for data, with a high degree of comparability between data collected in different Member States.
Businesses and their professional associations need such information in order to understand their markets and to compare their activity and performance with those of their competitors, at regional, national and international level. | Community action will better achieve the objectives of the proposal for the following reason(s). | The best method of ascertaining the structure, activity, competitiveness and performance of enterprises in the community consists in compiling statistics in accordance with common methodological principals and common definitions of characteristics.
Only the European Union is in a position to do this. | The proposal therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle. | Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). | The proposed regulation and all implementing regulations will be output measures, defining the statistical characteristics and the breakdown by activities to be provided, but leaving Member States full flexibility in how to obtain to data.
Additional costs are expected to be marginal. | ADDITIONAL INFORMATION | Simulation, pilot phase and transitory period | There was or there will be a simulation or a pilot phase for the proposal. | There was or there will be a transitory period for the proposal. | Simplification | The proposal provides for simplification of legislation. | 25 variables have been dropped from the regulation.
The Stockholm European Council meeting in March 2001 concluded that the creation of effectively functioning internal markets for services is one of Europe’s highest priorities.
Linking such ad hoc data collections with the ongoing collection of Structural Business Statistics data brings value added to the information gathered in both surveys and can reduce the total burden on respondents by avoiding duplication of data collection. (8) It is necessary to provide for a procedure for the adoption of measures for the implementation of this Regulation in order to enable the rules for the collection and statistical processing of data and for processing and transmission of the results to be clarified further. (9) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission6. (10) If the Commission, on the basis of the evaluation of pilot studies concerning non-market activities in Sections M to O of NACE Rev. 1.1, according to Annex I, Section 10, paragraph 1, and Annex IX, Section 12, deems it necessary to expand the current scope of this Regulation it should make a proposal in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty. (11) Since the objectives of the action to be taken, namely to provide harmonised data on the structure, activity, competitiveness and performance of businesses in the Community, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. ê 58/97 (adapted) HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Ö Subject matter Õ The objective of tThis Regulation shall be to establish Ö establishes Õ a common framework for the collection, compilation, transmission and evaluation of Community statistics on the structure, activity, competitiveness and performance of businesses in the Community.
