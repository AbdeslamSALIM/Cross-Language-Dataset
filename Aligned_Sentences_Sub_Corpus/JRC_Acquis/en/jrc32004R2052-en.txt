Existing measures (1) Following an expiry review, by Regulation (EC) No 964/2003 [2] (the original Regulation), the Council imposed, inter alia, definitive anti-dumping duties of 58,6 % on imports of tube or pipe fittings (other than cast fittings, flanges and threaded fittings), of iron or steel (not including stainless steel), with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609,6 mm, of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes, falling within CN codes ex73079311 (TARIC code 7307931199), ex73079319 (TARIC code 7307931999), ex73079930 (TARIC code 7307993098) and ex73079990 (TARIC code 7307999098) and originating in the People's Republic of China (PRC). 2.
According to Eurostat data, imports declared as originating from Indonesia into this Member State represented two thirds of imports declared as originating in Indonesia into the Community during 2003.
It was made clear to the authorities of Indonesia that non-cooperation may lead to the application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
The imports of the two other importers represented 5,5 % of total imports declared as originating in Indonesia during the IP.
Change in the pattern of trade (14) As already stated the prima facie evidence suggested that the change in the pattern of trade stemmed from transhipment and an incorrect declaration of origin of the product, as imports were declared as originating in Indonesia, whereas evidence existed that the goods originated in the PRC. (15) As no Indonesian company cooperated in the investigation, exports from Indonesia to the Community had to be established on the basis of the facts available pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
Eurostat data, which were the most appropriate information available in such a situation, were therefore used to establish the export prices and quantities from Indonesia to the Community. (16) Imports of tube or pipe fittings declared as originating in Indonesia increased from 0 tonnes in 2000 to 866 tonnes in the IP.
Imports into the Community of tube or pipe fittings from the PRC increased from 44 tonnes in 2000 to 287 tonnes in the IP.
Indeed, the volume of the Chinese exports in the IP amounted to less than 10 % of the volume exported in the period under consideration of the original investigation.
It has been established that during the IP average export prices from Indonesia were around 34 % below the average export prices from the PRC. (21) On the basis of the above, it is concluded that the change in trade flows, together with the abnormally low prices of exports from Indonesia have undermined the remedial effects of the anti-dumping measures in terms of the quantities and prices of the like products. 6.
Evidence of dumping in relation to the normal values previously established for like or similar products (22) In order to determine whether evidence of dumping could be found with respect to the product concerned exported to the Community from Indonesia during the IP, export prices established on the basis of Eurostat data were used pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation. (23) Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation requires evidence of dumping in relation to the normal values previously established for the like or similar products.
The request shall be sent to the following address: European Commission Directorate-General for Trade Directorate B J-79 5/16 B-1049 Brussels Fax (32 2) 295 65 05 Telex COMEU B 21877. 2.
Article 3 Customs authorities are hereby directed to discontinue the registration of imports, established in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2004.
Article 4 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
