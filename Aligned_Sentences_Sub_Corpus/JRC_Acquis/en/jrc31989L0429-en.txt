By 1 December 1995, the following emission limit values, standardized at the following conditions: temperature 273 K, pressure 101,3 kPa, 11 % oxygen or 9 % CO2 and dry gas, shall apply to existing municipal waste incineration plants: (a) plants whose nominal capacity is less than 6 tonnes of waste per hour but at least one tonne per hour: - total dust 100 mg/nm3; (b) plants whose nominal capacity is less than one tonne of waste per hour: - total dust 600 mg/nm3. 2.
In this case, the concentration values may not exceed those laid down in paragraph 1, divided by 2,5. 3.
Within the time limits laid down in paragraph 1 for each category of plant respectively, all existing municipal waste-incineration plants shall observe a limit value of 100 mg/nm3 for the carbon monoxide (CO) concentration in the combustion gases while in operation.
This limit value shall be standardized at the following conditions: temperature 273 K, pressure 101,3kPa, 11 % oxygen or 9 % CO2 and dry gas. 3.
The carbon monoxide (CO) concentration laid down in Article 4 (2) is: (a) in the case of plants of a nominal capacity of 6 tonnes per hour or more, the limit value for the hourly average.
The results of the measurements referred to in paragraph 1 shall be standardized at the following conditions: - temperature 273 K, pressure 101,3 kPa, 11 % oxygen or 9 % Co2, dry gas.
Where Article 3 (2) is applied, however, they may be standardized at the following conditions: - temperature 273 K, pressure 101,3 kPa, 17 % oxygen, dry gas. 3.
Under no circumstances may the plant continue to operate more than 16 hours uninterrupted; moreover the cumulative duration over a year of operation in such conditions shall be less than 200 hours.
The dust content of the discharges shall under no circumstances exceed 600 mg/nm3 during the periods referred to in the preceding subparagraqph and all the other conditions, in particular the combustion conditions, shall be complied with.
Article 9 Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that compliance with the conditions imposed on existing incineration plants pursuant to this Directive is verified by the competent authorities.
Article 11 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
