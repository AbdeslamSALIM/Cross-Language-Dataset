Proposal for a Council Regulation imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of magnesium oxide originating in the People's Republic of China /* COM/2005/0149 final */ Brussels, 18.4.2005 COM(2005) 149 final Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of magnesium oxide originating in the People's Republic of China (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
The review was initiated following a request from the Community producers, indicating that the expiry of the measures would be likely to lead to a continuation or recurrence of injurious dumping.
Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. (6) The Commission’s services sent questionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to those who requested a questionnaire within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. (7) In view of the apparent high number of exporting producers in the PRC and importers of the product concerned, sampling was envisaged in the notice of initiation, in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation.
Therefore, it was decided that sampling was not necessary. (8) In addition, questionnaires were sent to all the producers in the United States of America (‘USA’), Australia and India (potential analogue countries), which were known to the Commission’s services. (9) Replies to the questionnaire were received from the four applicant Community producers and one producer in the analogue country, namely USA. (10) The Commission’s services sought and verified all the information deemed necessary for the purpose of the determination of the likelihood of continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury and for the determination of the Community interest.
LIKELIHOOD OF A CONTINUATION OF DUMPING (15) In accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether the expiry of the measures would be likely to lead to a continuation of dumping.
Analogue country (23) Since the PRC is an economy in transition, normal value had to be based on information obtained in an appropriate market economy third-country in accordance with Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation. (24) Since in the previous expiry review India was selected as an analogue country for the purposes of establishing normal value, a request for co-operation was sent to Indian producers.
Export price (29) As already mentioned, in the absence of any other more reliable information, the export price was based on the Eurostat data.
It was found that data on prices in the Eurostat are recorded on a CIF European Community frontier basis.
Chinese production capacity (33) According to the expiry review request, Chinese producers have substantial spare production capacity as they have the largest magnesite ore resource in the world, estimated at 1 300 million tonnes.
The total Chinese production capacity for the product concerned is estimated at between 800 000 and 1 000 000 tonnes per year, whereas the Chinese domestic consumption is estimated at some 250 000 tonnes and exports of around 550 000 tonnes per year.
DEFINITION OF THE COMMUNITY INDUSTRY (39) The four complainant Community producers replied to the questionnaires and fully co-operated in the investigation.

As in the previous expiry review, it is considered, however, that Community consumption did not have a major influence on the situation in the Community industry during the period considered as explained in recital 42 on the Community consumption. (74) The measures in force have led to a partial recovery of the Community industry since 2000.
The Community industry’s sales have been profitable from 2001 (0.9%) to the IP (1.6%).
COMMUNITY INTEREST Preliminary remark (80) In accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether maintaining the existing anti-dumping measures would be against the interest of the Community as a whole.
Interests of unrelated importers/traders (84) The Commission’s services sent out questionnaires to 23 importers/traders named in the complaint.
No answers were received. (87) Given the lack of response to the questionnaires and of verifiable data in support of an expiry of the measures in force, as in the previous expiry review, it is concluded that the continuation of the duties would not have a significant effect on users.
A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of magnesium oxide falling within CN code ex 2519 90 90 (Taric code 2519 90 90*10) and originating in the People's Republic of China. 2.
The amount of the anti-dumping duty shall be: (a) the difference between the minimum import price of EUR 112 per tonne and the net, free-at-Community frontier price, before duty, in all cases where the latter is: — less than the minimum import price, and — established on the basis of an invoice issued by an exporter located in the People's Republic of China directly to an unrelated party in the Community (TARIC additional code A420); (b) zero, if the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, is established on the basis of an invoice issued by an exporter located in the People's Republic of China directly to an unrelated party in the Community and equal to or higher than the minimum import price of EUR 112 per tonne (TARIC additional code A420); (c) equal to an ad valorem duty of 27.1% in all other cases not falling under subparagraph (a) and (b) (TARIC additional code A999).
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
