Article 3 No Member State may refuse the registration or prohibit the sale, entry into service, or use of tractors on grounds relating to the maximum design speed or the load platforms if these satisfy the requirements set out in the Annex.

Done at Brussels, 4 March 1974.
The soil of the track shall be stabilized ; the track shall be flat and at least 100 metres long ; however it may include slopes of not more than 1.5 %. 1.2.
To take account of various unavoidable errors due, in particular, to the measuring technique and the increase in running speed of the engine with a partial load, a result 10 % higher than the 25 km/h value shall be acceptable for the type-approval test. 1.6.
The platform shall be laid out symmetrically in relation to the longitudinal median plane of the tractor. 2.4.
The load platform shall be detachable ; it shall be attached to the tractor in such a way as to avoid any risk of accidental detachment.
