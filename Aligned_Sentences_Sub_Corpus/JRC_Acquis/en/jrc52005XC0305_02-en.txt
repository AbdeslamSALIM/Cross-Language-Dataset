The treatment of ancillary restraints under the EC Merger Regulation is further explained in recital 21 in the preamble to the EC Merger Regulation, which states that "Commission decisions declaring concentrations compatible with the common market in application of this Regulation should automatically cover such restrictions, without the Commission having to assess such restrictions in individual cases".
The Commission's residual function is addressed in recital 21 of the Merger Regulation, where it is stated that the Commission should, at the request of the undertakings concerned, expressly assess the ancillary character of restrictions if a case presents "novel and unresolved questions giving rise to genuine uncertainty".
As envisaged in recital 21 of the Merger Regulation, the Commission will, at the request of the parties, expressly assess such restrictions in these cases.
To the extent that restrictions are directly related and necessary to the implementation of the concentration, Article 21(1) of the Merger Regulation provides that this Regulation alone applies, to the exclusion of Council Regulations (EC) No 1/2003 [4], (EEC) No 1017/68 [5] and (EEC) No 4056/86 [6].
By contrast, for restrictions that cannot be regarded as directly related and necessary to the implementation of the concentration, Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty remain potentially applicable.
GENERAL PRINCIPLES 10.
Thus, as a general rule, restrictions which benefit the vendor are either not directly related and necessary to the implementation of the concentration at all [17], or their scope and/or duration need to be more limited than that of clauses which benefit the purchaser [18].
Protection against competition from the vendor in product or service markets in which the transferred undertaking was not active before the transfer is not considered necessary [25]. 24.
Non-solicitation and confidentiality clauses have a comparable effect and are therefore evaluated in a similar way to non-competition clauses [27].
Licence agreements 27.
Restrictions in licence agreements going beyond the above provisions, such as those which protect the licensor rather than the licensee, are not necessary to the implementation of the concentration [30]. 31.
Non-competition obligations 36.
Licence agreements 42.
Licence agreements between the parents are not considered directly related and necessary to the implementation of a joint venture.
