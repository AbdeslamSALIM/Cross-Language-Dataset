Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION providing macro-financial assistance to Georgia (SEC(2005)1449) . (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The Commission proposes to provide macro-financial assistance to Georgia in the form of a grant with a view to supporting the government's economic reform programme and helping the country reduce external indebtedness, thereby improving external and fiscal sustainability over the medium-term.
The proposed macro-financial assistance will be limited in time, complement support from the Bretton Woods Institutions, bilateral donors and the Paris Club, and will be conditional, in particular, on progress in the implementation of the IMF-supported PRGF arrangement.
The current account deficit is projected to widen in 2005 to about 12 percent of GDP (7.6 percent in 2004), owing to robust import demand in the pipeline construction and other investment projects, before easing to around 7 percent in 2006.
Domestic public debt, consisting of Treasury bills and debt to the National Bank of Georgia, amounted to about 9 percent of GDP in 2004.
Thereafter, the Paris Club creditors agreed in July 2004 to a restructuring of Georgia's bilateral official debt on the Houston terms.
In the period 1998-2004, the Community made available to Georgia exceptional financial assistance consisting of a loan of EUR 110 million (disbursed in July 1998 after Georgia had settled arrears of EUR 131 million to the Community) and a total grant of EUR 65 million (of which only EUR 31.5 million was committed and paid by end-2004).
A new liberal tax code has been effective since January 2005 and further measures to improve the business climate are on the government agenda.
Given these commendable improvements in the overall economic policy environment, the Commission deems appropriate to make available to Georgia macro-financial assistance in the form of grants through re-programming of the uncommitted grant amount of EUR 33.5 million. | 130 | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal Council Decision of 17 November 1997 providing exceptional financial assistance for Armenia and Georgia (97/787/EC).
Council Decision of 20 March 2000 amending Decision 97/787/EC providing exceptional financial assistance for Armenia and Georgia in order to extend it to Tajikistan (2000/244/EC).
The present proposal for a new legal basis for macro-financial assistance to Georgia entails reprogramming of the uncommitted and undisbursed grant amount of EUR 33.5 million out of EUR 65 million which had been earmarked for Georgia under the total ceiling of EUR 130 million (Article 1(3) as amended by Decision 2000/244/EC). | 140 | Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union EU-Georgia relations are entering a phase of deeper integration through the inclusion of Georgia in the European Neighbourhood Policy.
The Commission services have been in contact with the authorities and the International Monetary Fund during the preparation of the present Commission proposal to discuss the modalities of the assistance.
Following the adoption of the Council Decision, the Commission services will negotiate a Memorandum of Understanding with the Georgian authorities to lay down in detail the implementation modalities of the assistance. | Collection and use of expertise | 229 | There was no need for external expertise. | 230 | Impact assessment Because the macro-financial assistance is a policy-based instrument, it is particularly well-suited to support the efforts of the Georgian government to improve the external and fiscal debt sustainability in the short-to-medium run.
The assistance will be made available in at least two instalments over the period 2006-2007 conditional on (i) the implementation of a set of measures to be jointly agreed with the government and (ii) a satisfactory implementation by Georgia of the IMF-supported economic programme.
The assistance is managed by the Commission which shall agree with the authorities the specific economic policy and financial conditions attached to the payment of the grant instalments.
The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. | Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s): | 331 | The assistance will be fully consistent with the macroeconomic targets already set in the IMF supported PRGF arrangement.
This is deemed an appropriate level of burden sharing for the Community, given the assistance provided to Georgia by bilateral creditors and the international donor community in general. | Choice of instruments | 341 | Proposed instruments: other. | 342 | Other means would not be adequate for the following reason(s): In the absence of a framework regulation for the macro-financial assistance instrument, ad hoc Council decisions under Article 308 of the Treaty are the only available legal instrument for this assistance. | BUDGETARY IMPLICATION | 401 | EUR 33.5 million to be committed under budget line 01 03 02 01 "Macroeconomic assistance for partner countries of eastern Europe and central Asia". | ADDITIONAL INFORMATION | Review/revision/sunset clause | 533 | The proposal includes a sunset clause. | 1. 2005/0224(CNS) Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION providing macro-financial assistance to Georgia THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament[2], Whereas: 2.
Council Decision 97/787/EC[3] provides for exceptional financial assistance to Armenia and Georgia in the form of long-term loans and grants. 3.
In case of Georgia, the objectives of the assistance have not been fully met, owing to an unsatisfactory economic policy environment in the country during most part of the implementation period. 5.
Therefore, only EUR 31.5 million of the total grant allocation of EUR 65 million to Georgia was committed and paid under the exceptional financial assistance. 6.
The present authorities of Georgia are committed to economic stabilisation and structural reforms, supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) through a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) which was approved on 4 June 2004 in a total amount of SDR 98 million.
Thereafter, the Paris Club creditors agreed on 21 July 2004 to a restructuring of Georgia’s bilateral official debt on the Houston terms. 7.
The new Government of Georgia received strong support from the international community also at the donors’ conference held in Brussels on 16 June 2004. 8.
The World Bank approved in June 2004 a USD 24 million Reform Support Credit (RSC), and will continue its assistance to Georgia under a new Country Partnership Strategy in the form of Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSO). 9.
The Commission services, with the support of duly mandated external experts, carried out in October 2004 an operational assessment of the financial circuits and administrative procedures at the Ministry of Finance of Georgia and the National Bank of Georgia to ascertain the existence of a framework for sound financial management. 14.
The Commission has consulted the Economic and Financial Committee before submitting its proposal. 16.
The Treaty does not provide for the adoption of this Decision powers other than those of Article 308, HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: Article 1 17.
