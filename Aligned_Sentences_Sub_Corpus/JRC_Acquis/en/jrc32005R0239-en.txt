Accordingly, it is necessary to lay down rules for the determination of the proportion of permanent pasture in relation to arable land that has to be maintained in the new Member States.
That period should be extended in order to share more equally amongst farmers the burden to maintain permanent pasture. (6) Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 provides that single applications are to be submitted by a date to be fixed by the Member States which must not be later than 15 May in a given year.
However, due to the particular climatic conditions in Finland and Sweden, those two Member States may fix a later date which must not be later than 15 June.
The date of 15 June should also apply with regard to notifications from farmers to the competent authority of subsequent amendments to the single application, as provided for in Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004. (7) In order to enable Member States to carry out controls effectively, in particular controls on the respect of cross-compliance obligations, Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 obliges farmers to declare all the areas at their disposal whether or not they claim aid for such areas.
It is necessary to provide for a mechanism to ensure that farmers comply with that obligation. (8) Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 contains special rules to provide for the situation where the latest date for the submission of an aid application is a public holiday, a Saturday or a Sunday.
Late submissions of those applications should therefore only be permitted within the same additional time-limit, as provided for in Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004, for the late submission of any aid applications.
Those reductions, as well as the introduction of further kinds of reductions by this Regulation, need to be taken into account in the framework of Article 71 of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004. (15) Rules need to be established to cover the eventuality where a farmer has received unduly a number of payment entitlements or that the value of each of the payment entitlements was fixed at an incorrect level according to the different models under the Single Payment Scheme.
Without prejudice to cases of force majeure and exceptional circumstances referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 34(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and by way of derogation from Article 21 of this Regulation, in the first year of the application of the single payment scheme in accordance with Title III of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, where, in the Member Stat concerned, an application for the allocation of entitlements in accordance with Article 34(3) of that Regulation and the single application for that year have to be submitted together by the farmer and where the farmer submits those applications after the relevant time limit, a 4 % reduction per working day shall be applied to the amounts to be paid in that year in respect of the payment entitlements to be allocated to the farmer.
If such delay exceeds 25 calendar days, the application shall be considered inadmissible and no payment entitlements shall be allocated to the farmer. 2.
Where, in the Member State concerned, the application to the single payment scheme and the single application have to be submitted independently from each other, Article 21 shall apply with regard to the submission of the single application.
In that case, without prejudice to cases of force majeure and exceptional circumstances referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 34(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the submission of an application to the single payment scheme in accordance with that Article after the relevant time limit shall lead to a 3 % reduction per working day in the amounts to be paid in the first year of the application of the single payment scheme in respect of the payment entitlements to be allocated to the farmer.
Where more than one non-compliance with regard to different areas of cross-compliance have been determined, the procedure for the fixing of the reduction as set out in paragraph 1 shall be applied individually to each non-compliance.
However, the maximum reduction shall not exceed 5 % of the overall amount referred to in paragraph 1."; (b) the third subparagraph of paragraph 4 is replaced by the following: "Once the maximum percentage of 15 % has been reached, the Paying Agency shall inform the farmer concerned that if the same non-compliance is determined again, it shall be considered that he has acted intentionally within the meaning of Article 67.
Where, after payment entitlements have been allocated to farmers in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 795/2004, it is established that certain payment entitlements have been allocated unduly, the farmer concerned shall give up the unduly allocated entitlements to the national reserve referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
The value of the reduction shall be allocated to the national reserve referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
It shall apply from 1 January 2005.
