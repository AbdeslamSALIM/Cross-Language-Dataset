Article 2 In accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of Directive 73/404/EEC, the Member States shall prohibit the placing on the market and use on their territory of a detergent if the level of biodegradability of the non-ionic surfactants contained in such detergent is less than 80 % determined in accordance with one of the following methods: - the OECD method, published in the OECD technical report of 11 June 1976 on the %quot%Proposed Method for the Determination of the Biodegradability of Surfactants used in Synthetic Detergents%quot%, - the method in use in Germany, established by the %quot%Verordnung über die Abbaubarkeit anionischer und nichtionischer grenzflächenaktiver Stoffe in Wasch- und Reinigungsmitteln%quot% of 30 January 1977, published in the Bundesgesetzblatt, 1977, Part I, page 244, as set out in the Regulation amending that Regulation of 18 June 1980, published in the Bundesgesetzblatt, 1980, Part I, page 706, - the method in use in France, approved by Decree of 28 December 1977 published in the Journal officiel de la République française of 18 January 1978, and experimental standard T 73-270 March 1974, published by the Association française de normalisation (AFNOR), - the method in use in the United Kingdom called the %quot%Porous Pot Test%quot%, as described in Technical Report No 70/1978 of the Water Research Centre.
Article 3 Under the procedure laid down in Article 5 (2) of Directive 73/404/EEC, the laboratory opinion on non-ionic surfactants shall be based on the reference method (confirmatory test procedure) described in the Annex to this Directive.
Vessels A and F must be of glass or suitable plastic and hold at least 24 litres.
Pump B must provide a constant flow of synthetic sewage to the aeration vessel ; this vessel, during normal operation, contains three litres of mixed liquor.
The BiAS content must be determined in order to prepare the synthetic sewage (1.3). 1.4.2.
The BiAS content of the extract must be known in order to prepare the synthetic sewage. 1.5.
The height of the vessel D should be so fixed that the volume contained in the seration vessel C is three litres.
The synthetic sewage must pass through the aeration vessel C at a rate of one litre per hour ; this gives a mean retention time of three hours.
The effluent from the settling vessel D is accumulated in vessel F for 24 hours, following which a sample is taken after thorough mixing.
The BiAS content (in mg/l) of the effluent collected over 24 hours in vessel F should be determined analytically by the same method, immediately after collection : otherwise the samples must be preserved, preferably by freezing.
As a check on the efficiency of the process, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) or the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the glass fibre filtered effluent accumulated in vessel F and of the filtered synthetic sewage in vessel A is measured at least twice per week.
The reduction in COD or DOC should level off when a roughly regular daily BiAS degradation is obtained at the end of the running-in period shown in Figure 3.
The content of dry matter in the activated sludge contained in the aeration vessel should be determined twice a week in g/l.
The degradation test is performed at room temperature ; this should be steady and kept between 292 and 297 K (19-24 ºC). 1.7.
Calculation of biodegradability The percentage degradation of BiAS must be calculated every day on the basis of the BiAS content in mg/l of the synthetic sewage and of the corresponding effluent accumulated in vessel F.
The degradability of the BiAS should be calculated as the arithmetic mean of the figures obtained over the 21 days which follow the running-in period, during which degradation has been regular and the operation of the plant trouble-free.
In some cases it may be permissible to reduce the frequency of sampling but at least 14 results collected over the 21 days which follow the running-in period should be used in calculating the average.
Thus soap, anionic and non-ionic surfactants may be isolated in one procedure. 2.1.3.
Analytical control After homogenizing, the concentration of anionic and non-ionic surfactants in the detergent is determined according to the MBAS and BiAS analytical procedure.
Quantitative extraction is not necessary ; however, at least 80 % of the non-ionic surfactants should be extracted.
Usually, 90 % or more is obtained. 2.2.

The exchange column is now in the OH form and ready for operation. 2.4.4.
Heat the exchange columns to 323 K (50 ºC) using thermostatic control.
Heat 5 000 ml of the solution obtained in item 2.4.2 to 333 K (60 ºC) and pass the solution through the exchanger combination at a rate of 20 ml/min.
Wash the columns with 1 000 ml hot isopropanol/water mixture (2.3.3).
Add deionized water until a defined volume is obtained and determine the BiAS content as in item 3.3 in an aliquot.
The solution should be kept at a temperature below 278 K (5 ºC). 2.4.5.
The anion-exchange resin is regenerated by passing about 5 000-6 000 ml of ammonium bicarbonate solution (2.3.4) down the column at a flow rate of approximately 10 ml/min until the eluate is free from anionic surfactants (methylene blue test).
Then pass 2 000 ml isopropanol/water mixture (2.3.3) down the anion exchanger to wash.
After phaser separation and evaporation of the solvent, the non-ionic surfactant is precipitated in aqueous solution with modified Dragendorff reagent (KBiJ4 + BaCl2 + glacial acetic acid).
The precipitate is filtered, washed with glacial acetic acid and dissolved in ammonium tartrate solution.
