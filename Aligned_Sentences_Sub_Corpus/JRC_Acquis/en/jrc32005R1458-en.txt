Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC. (5) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus niger (MUCL 39199) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1436/98 [3].
Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex I, should be authorised without a time limit. (6) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus aculeatus (CBS 589.94), endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CBS 592.94), alpha-amylase produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9553) and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma viride (NIBH FERM BP 4842) is authorised for chickens for fattening without a time limit by Commission Regulation (EC) No 358/2005 [4], and provisionally for turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2013/2001 [5].
Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised for four years. (7) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105), endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2106) is authorised for chickens for fattening without a time limit by Commission Regulation (EC) No 833/2005 [6].
Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised for four years. (8) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation of the use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 109.713) for chickens for fattening.
Article 2 The preparations belonging to the group "Enzymes", as specified in Annex II, are authorised for use for four years as additive in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.
