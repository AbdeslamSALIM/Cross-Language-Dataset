2006/904/EC: Commission Decision of 7 June 2006 on State Aid No C 8/2005 (ex N 451/2004) which Germany is planning to implement for Nordbrandenburger UmesterungsWerke (notified under document number C(2006) 2088) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 7 June 2006 on State Aid No C 8/2005 (ex N 451/2004) which Germany is planning to implement for Nordbrandenburger UmesterungsWerke (notified under document number C(2006) 2088) (Only the German version is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/904/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provision(s) cited above [1], Whereas: 1.
PROCEDURE (1) By letter dated 11 October 2004, registered as received on 12 October 2004, Germany informed the Commission of its intention to implement a regional aid measure for NUW Nordbrandenburger UmesterungsWerke.
In response to a Commisison request for information sent on 6 November 2004, Germany submitted further information on 16 December 2004. (2) By letter dated 16 February 2005 the Commission informed Germany that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the Treaty in respect of the aid. (3) The Commission's decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2].
DESCRIPTION OF THE AID 2.1 The recipient and the project (7) The recipient of the aid is NUW Nordbrandenburger UmesterungsWerke GmbH %amp% Co.
NUW was established on 4 May 2004.
Consequently, in October 2004 NUW did not yet have any full-time or part-time employees. (8) NUW intends to build and operate in Schwedt a manufacturing plant for biodiesel with an expected annual capacity of 130000 tonnes and eligible investment costs of EUR 41,84 million.
Germany will ensure that the 50 % ceiling for aid intensity will not be exceeded. 2.3 Reasons for initiating the formal investigation procedure (11) Since the aid is based on approved schemes the Commission limits its assessment to the question whether the recipient qualifies as an SME and is thus eligible for an additional SME bonus of 15 % as included in the envisaged aid amount. (12) According to Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SME Recommendation) [5], small and medium-sized enterprises are defined as enterprises which have fewer than 250 employees and have an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million. (13) The concept of undertaking does not require that the recipient be limited to one distinct legal entity; it may encompass an economic group of companies which is larger than an individual SME.
Enterprises may be considered to be linked enterprises if they are linked through a natural person and operate in the same relevant market or in adjacent markets. (14) The link between NUW and other enterprises through natural persons, in particular through members of the Sauter family, may result in joint activities in the same or adjacent markets.
COMMENTS FROM GERMANY Criterion of independence (17) Germany explains that NUW Verwaltung GmbH is financially not involved in the recipient NUW.
All other complementary enterprises (%quot%Verwaltung GmbH%quot%) exclusively take over the liabilities of their relevant enterprises and do not carry out further operations. (18) Whereas Daniela Sauter has a 74 % stake in NUW, her holdings in NBE Nordbrandenburger BioEnergie GmbH %amp% Co.
According to Germany there are no other enterprises linked to NUW. (19) With regard to the partner enterprises Germany states that Daniela Sauter has holdings of 50 % in NBE, 38 % in MBE and 20 % in SBE.
Relevant markets (22) According to Germany, NUW and MUW Mitteldeutsche UmesterungsWerke GmbH %amp% Co.
Germany stresses that the contract between SBE and NUW was drafted in such a way that SBE could not influence NUW's management decisions.
Sauter Verpachtung GmbH (28) According to Germany, the sale of fuel is of only minor importance and accounts for only 1 % of the turnover of the enterprise.
Conclusions by Germany (31) Since relations between NBE and MBE only exist via the person of Mrs Daniela Sauter and since there are no further relevant relations to other enterprises, Germany concludes that NUW qualifies as an SME.
Replying to the Commission's questions sent in this context to Germany on 8 November 2005, Germany provided additional information on 13 January 2006.
Shareholdings and ownership (33) In addition to various real estate and wind energy undertakings (Germany did not provide further details) the members of the Sauter family have majority shareholdings in 16 enterprises.
Daniele Sauter holds the majority (74 %) of the shares in NUW, for which the SME bonus was notified; she is the sister of Bernd and Claus Sauter.
Alois and Albertina Sauter are the parents of Daniele, Bernd and Claus Sauter.
Marion Sauter is married to Claus Sauter.
Finally, Georg Pollert, who has no family link to the Sauter family, holds 24 % of the shares in NUW. (34) With the exception of NUW Nordbrandenburger Umesterungswerke Verwaltung GmbH [6] (Daniela Sauter: 50 %), the Sauter family controls all the Sauter family enterprises via majority shareholdings: SBE Swiss BioEnergy AG (100 %), Sauter Verpachtung GmbH (100 %), Alois Sauter Landesprodukten-Großhandlung GmbH %amp% Co.
KG (100 %), NBE Nordbrandenburger BioEnergie Verwaltung GmbH (100 %) and NUW (74 %). (35) The business purposes of NUW Nordbrandenburger Umesterungswerke Verwaltung GmbH, MUW Mitteldeutsche UmesterungsWerke Verwaltungs GmbH, Mitteldeutsche BioEnergie Verwaltung GmbH and NBE Nordbrandenburger BioEnergie Verwaltung GmbH are to manage and represent other enterprises.
Business relations (36) According to Germany the term %quot%Sauter Group%quot% is publicly used only for Alois Sauter Landesproduktengroßhandlung, Sauter Verpachtung and Compos Entsorgung, which closely cooperate in the area of transport and waste treatment.
The transport fleet of Sauter Verpachtung and Alois Sauter Landesproduktengroßhandlung carries advertising for biodiesel.
Germany cannot explain why credit institutions as NordLB use the term %quot%group%quot% for some enterprises of the Sauter family. (37) The enterprises have numerous business relations, which according to Germany cannot be %quot%fully listed%quot%: (a) As a general contractor SBE Swiss BioEnergy AG will install the biodiesel plant for the proposed recipient NUW.
Its gas stations are used by MBE and Autokontor Bayern. (b) For waste water management, Compos Entsorgung Gmbh uses mainly the transport fleet of Alois Sauter Landesproduktengrosshandlung GmbH and Sauter Verpachtung GmbH.
Sauter Verpachtung shares an office building with Compos Ensorgung GmbH and Autokontor Bayern GmbH. (c) Customers of MUW are Alois Sauter Landesproduktengroßhandlung, Autokontor Bayern, Sauter Verpachtung and MBE.
SBE delivers crude oil and refined products to MUW for further processing into biodiesel. (d) Alois Sauter Landesproduktengroßhandlung lets buildings and ground to Autokontor Bayern and repairs and maintains the transport fleet of Sauter Verpachtung, Autokontor Bayern, MBE and MUW.
It operates a gas station for MUW, MBE, Sauter Verpachtung and Autokontor Bayern. (e) For some time MBE and Sauter Verpachtung were sharing an office building.
MBE carries out transport services for Sauter Verpachtung and Autokontor Bayern. (f) SBE cooperates with MUW, NUW, MBE NBE and Autokontor Bayern.
Suppliers and customers of the enterprises of the Sauter family (42) The enterprises Bunge Deutschland GmbH and Cargill supply both MUW and NUW with vegetable oil.
Approving increased aid for enterprises which, although meeting the formal criteria defining an SME, do not suffer from the handicaps typical of an SME would be contrary to Article 87 EC, since such an increase in aid is likely to produce more severe distortions of competition and thus adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest within the meaning of Article 87(3)(c).%quot% (48) In order to determine the necessity of the increased aid intensity for the recipient company, the Commission considers that it is necessary to examine various factors such as the shareholding structure, the identity of the managing directors, the degree of economic integration and any other links of the companies involved.
Alois and Albertina Sauter are the parents of Daniela, Bernd and Claus Sauter.
Marion Sauter is married to Claus Sauter.
It follows from this that Daniela, Bernd, Claus, Alois and Albertina belong to the traditional %quot%core family%quot% and that Marion Sauter is a sister-in-law.
First of all, SBE Swiss BioEnergy AG and Sauter Verpachtung serve as general contractors for setting up bioethanol and biodiesel plants operated by entities held by the family.
KG carries advertising for biodiesel.
Furthermore, Alois Sauter Landesproduktengroßhandlung GmbH %amp% Co.
The same enterprise maintains and repairs the transport fleet of Sauter Verpachtung GmbH, Autokontor Bayern GmbH, MBE and MUW. (56) In addition to these business relations, the close relationship between the members of the Sauter family are also evident in numerous real estate and wind energy undertakings. (57) The Commission considers that, from an economic perspective too, the group of enterprises has to be regarded as one entity.
The links between the companies have not been established recently, but appear based on a common history and a planned joint development. (58) At the Internet site http://www.sauter-logistik.de/Sauter_Gruppe.htm the enterprises Landesprodukten-Grosshandlung GmbH, Sauter GmbH, Compos Ensorgung GmbH, MUW GmbH, AIIEN GmbH, Autokontor Bayern GmbH and Biodiesel Production S.A present themselves as the Sauter Group, again indicating joint economic behaviour. (59) Furthermore, banks such as NordLB refer to several enterprises controlled by the Sauter family as the %quot%Sauter Group%quot%.
As mentioned above, SBE Swiss BioEnergy AG will as a general contractor install the biodiesel plant for the proposed recipient NUW.
In this context it should be emphasised that NUW, MUW, MBE and NBE all supply their products to SBE Swiss BioEnergy AG and that three companies of the group (NUW NBE and MBE) sell their production to the large oil companies.
Finally, both biodiesel and bioethanol serve as fuels for vehicles.
In the case of newly established enterprises whose accounts have not yet been approved, the data to apply are to be derived from a bona fide estimate made in the course of the financial year. (64) Quite apart from the years which are taken into account (2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005), the Sauter group consistently exceeded the thresholds for annual turnover and the annual balance sheet total.
The Sauter Group's staff and financial data (65) According to the information provided by Germany, the staff and financial data of the enterprises in which the Sauter family has a majority holding (excluding NUW Verwaltung GmbH) for the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 were as follows: | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | Staff | 122 | 164 | 332 | 412 | Annual turnover in EUR | 79819124 | 107082928 | 296332725 | 421855238 | Annual balance sheet total in EUR | 135966984 | 327657218 | 331071069 | 404652910 | Details of the employment and financial data for each enterprise are set out in the Annex. (66) According to the Annex to the Commission Recommendation, an SME is defined as an enterprise which employs fewer than 250 persons and which has an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million.
KG in the form of an SME bonus is incompatible with the common market.
