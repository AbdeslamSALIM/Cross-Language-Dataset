having regard to its recent resolutions of 11 March 2004 [1] and 14 October 2004 [2] taking stock of the implementation of the Tampere programme and formulating its initial recommendations to the European Council, which adopted, on 5 November 2004, the Hague Programme laying down the guidelines for the area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ) for the following five years, B.
having regard to the debate on 11 April 2005 and to the answers given by the Council and Commission to Oral Questions Nos B6-0164/2005 and B6-0165/2005, C.
whereas matters have gradually become deadlocked in the European Council, too, which in 2004, on three occasions, was obliged to acknowledge difficulties in implementing Union decisions on, in particular, police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and, more specifically, in combating terrorism and international crime, E.
Repeats its call on the Council to establish a uniform legal framework for AFSJ-related policies, to move judicial and police cooperation into the Community sphere, pursuant to Article 42 of the EU Treaty, as a matter of urgency, and, in accordance with Article 67 of the EC Treaty, to use, as a matter of course, qualified-majority voting within the Council plus the codecision procedure for all AFSJ-related policies; 2.
Calls therefore on the Commission to draw up before September 2005 a proposal for a decision, on the basis of Article 42 of the EU Treaty, providing that action in areas referred to in Article 29 is to fall under Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and, at the same time, requiring such action to be decided on by qualified majority; calls on the Council to adopt a fresh decision, based on Article 67 of the EC Treaty, laying down a changeover to codecision for the Community measures provided for by Title IV and the removal of the limits on the Court's powers; 4.
Requests the Commission to bring forward the proposal for a supervisory mechanism supplementing the existing Schengen evaluation mechanism by the end of 2006; 16.
Recalls that a European migration policy should be accompanied by a European integration policy providing, among other things, for proper integration on the labour market, the right to education and training, access to social and health services, and immigrants' participation in social, cultural and political life; 21.
Calls on the European Union and its Member States to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 18 December 1990, and ILO Conventions 97 and 143 on migrant workers; calls on the Commission to include in decisions and framework decisions all the provisions contained in the UN Convention; 23.
Reminds the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, of its duty to ensure that the right of asylum is respected in the European Union, in accordance with Article 6 of the EU Treaty and Article 63 of the EC Treaty, given that recent cases of collective expulsions from certain Member States have cast a shadow over compliance by these countries with their obligations under EU law; 26.
Draws attention to the need for a Community immigration and asylum policy based on opening legal immigration channels and defining common standards for the protection of immigrants' and asylum seekers' fundamental rights throughout the European Union, as laid down by the Tampere European Council in 1999 and confirmed by the Hague Programme; 27.
Points out that those constraints cannot be brushed aside by simply invoking the new imperatives of the fight against terrorism and organised crime, but, rather, that there must be prior agreement on the objectives to be pursued and, consequently, the information which is essential to achieve what is sought must be defined and placed at the disposal of the competent authorities for an appropriate period; repeats its call to switch from a "pull" system to a "push" system for the transmission of data to the US authorities, and harbours the utmost reservations as to the establishment of a European PNR system to be placed under the responsibility of EUROPOL, as envisaged in the Commission communication on transfer of air passenger name record (PNR) data: a global EU approach (COM(2003)0826); calls on the Commission and the Council to take into consideration its resolution of 31 March 2004 [8] on PNR during all negotiations with third countries or international organisations, in particular the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO); 33.
Recalls that the Article 29 Working Group and the European Data Protection Supervisor consider that the national initiatives of April 2004 dealing with data retention do not fully comply with the ECHR and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; 37.
Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the European Council and the governments and parliaments of the Member States. [1] OJ C 102 E, 28.4.2004, p. 819.
