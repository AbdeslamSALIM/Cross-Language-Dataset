General remarks 4.
The ECB welcomes the core objective of the proposed regulation, which is intended to strengthen the legal framework for compiling government accounts underlying the EDP and to provide a legal basis for the Code of best practice on the compilation and reporting of data in the context of the excessive deficit procedure, adopted by the Council of Ministers (ECOFIN) on 18 February 2003.
Specific remarks 5.
The ECB would support deferring the reporting deadlines by one month, to 31 March and 30 September respectively, as this may improve the overall quality of government accounts, in particular government deficit data.
In addition, it would also enable statistical authorities to meet their obligations to compile budgetary data by giving them more time to complete the transition from the public accounts provided by various government bodies to the ESA 95 data required for EDP purposes. 6.
