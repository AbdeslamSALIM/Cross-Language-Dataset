Those identification and registration systems had to be extended to the movements of animals within the territory of each Member State by 1 January 1993. (2) Article 14 of Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC(4) states that the identification and registration provided for in Article 3(1)(c) of Directive 90/425/EEC must, except in the case of animals for slaughter and registered equidae, be carried out after the veterinary checks have been made. (3) Rules concerning the identification and the registration of ovine and caprine animals in particular have been laid down in Directive 92/102/EEC(5).
The minimum information required should be determined on a Community basis. (14) Each Member State should establish a central register compromising an up-to-date list of all keepers of animals covered by this Regulation who are engaged in this activity in its territory, and containing minimum information laid down on a Community basis. (15) For the purposes of rapid and accurate tracing of animals, each Member State should create a computer database which will record all holdings in its territory and the movements of the animals. (16) The nature of the means of identification should be determined on a Community basis. (17) Persons involved in trade in animals should keep records of their transactions, and the competent authority should have access to those records on request. (18) In order to ensure that this Regulation is correctly applied, it is necessary to provide for a rapid and efficient exchange of information between Member States on means of identification and related documents.

Any animal imported from a third country, which has undergone after 9 July 2005 the checks laid down by Directive 91/496/EEC and which remains within the territory of the Community shall be identified, in accordance with paragraph 2, at the holding of destination where livestock farming is carried out within a period, to be determined by the Member State, of no more than 14 days from undergoing those checks and, in any event, before leaving the holding.
Until the date referred to in Article 9(3), Member States which have introduced electronic identification on a voluntary basis in accordance with the provisions of Section A.4 and A.6 of the Annex shall ensure that the individual electronic identification number and the characteristics of the means used are mentioned in the relevant certificate pursuant to Directive 91/68/EEC accompanying animals involved in intra-Community trade.
Each keeper of animals, with the exception of the transporter, shall keep an up-to-date register containing at least the information listed in Section B of the Annex. 2.

By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the register of information required by Section B of the Annex shall be optional in any Member State where a centralised computer database which already contains this information is operational. 5.
As from 9 July 2005 whenever an animal is moved within the national territory between two separate holdings, it shall be accompanied by a movement document based on a model drawn up by the competent authority, containing at least the minimum information listed in Section C of the Annex, and completed by the keeper if the competent authority has not already done this. 2.
Member States may enter further information, in addition to that contained in Section C of the Annex, on the movement document referred to in paragraph 1, or require that such information be entered. 3.
Each keeper of animals, with the exception of the transporter, shall, within a period of 30 days as regards information relating to the keeper or the holding and within a period of seven days as regards information relating to movements of animals, provide the competent authority with: (a) the information for entry in the central register and the outcome of the inventory, mentioned in Article 7(2), and the information required for the setting up of the database referred to in paragraph 1; (b) in Member States applying the derogation referred to in Article 6(4), each time an animal is moved, the details of the movement, as set out in the movement document referred to in Article 6. 3.
Guidelines and procedures for the implementation of electronic identification shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 13(2). 2.
However, Member States in which the total number of ovine and caprine animals is 600000 or less, may make such electronic identification optional for animals not involved in intra-Community trade.
Member States in which the total number of caprine animals is 160000 or less may also make such electronic identification optional for caprine animals not involved in intra-Community trade. 4.
Amendments to the Annexes and measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 13(2).
