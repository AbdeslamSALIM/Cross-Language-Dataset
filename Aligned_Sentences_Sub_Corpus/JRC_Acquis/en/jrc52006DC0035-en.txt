White Paper on a european communication policy /* COM/2006/0035 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 1.2.2006 COM(2006) 35 final WHITE PAPER ON A EUROPEAN COMMUNICATION POLICY (presented by the Commission) Debating Europe, involving people INTRODUCTION: ‘CLOSING THE GAP’ Over the last two decades, the European Union has been transformed.
The European Parliament, Member States and the representation of European citizens have a special role to play, as peoples’ support for the European project is a matter of common interest. 2.
Far from being in competition, a stronger recognition of the European dimension in national political exchange can only add to its credibility.
PART II TAKING WORK FORWARD An agenda for action The Commission has identified five areas for action in partnership with the other EU institutions, Member States and civil society.
The five areas are accompanied by possible action points for discussion in the consultation process. 1.
Programmes like Leonardo da Vinci, Socrates, Erasmus, Youth in Action, etc.
Existing initiatives like Plan D , Youth in Action and Culture have shown how the EU can help set up new meeting places for civic debate. - Adoption of the proposed Citizens for Europe programme would offer a new route to connect citizens and to give them a greater say in European governance.
The three main institutions could also consider organising joint open debates to complement Parliamentary debates, taking questions from the public or from journalists. | - 3.
In recent years, all European institutions have made considerable efforts to improve the way they interact with the media.
But European issues also need to be discussed in the national and local context.
Digital technologies such as the Internet can offer new channels for communication on European issues, new forums for civic debate and new tools for cross-border democracy.
The European Commission has been a front runner in developing modern tools – such as the Eurobarometer surveys – for analysing European public opinion: - Eurobarometer has grown into a major European database which regularly observes public opinion in all EU Member States and in candidate countries, interviewing thousands of people each time.
To better anticipate and understand trends in public opinion in relation to issues of crucial importance for the future of Europe, new avenues for co-operation between the European institutions and Member States could be explored.
The EU institutions and bodies participating in the Inter-institutional Group on Information should help decentralise EU communication – ‘going local’ – and encourage Member States to be more active in informing citizens about EU affairs. - Many European policies and programmes are implemented at regional and local levels .
Thus local and regional authorities are well placed to engage in dialogue with citizens and to actively involve local communities in EU issues.
Cooperation between the national and European levels could include new initiatives taken at national level: public and parliamentary discussion on the Commission’s annual strategic priorities; face-to-face discussions between national ministers and European Commissioners, broadcast in the national media, etc.
Political parties could involve their members more in European political issues and contribute to the debate through trans-national European think tanks.

CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES The purpose of the White Paper on a European Communication Policy is to launch a wide-ranging consultation process on European communication policy in general and on the suggestions contained within the White Paper itself.
Action required Two websites will be needed for this consultation process: one for consultation on the European Charter for Information and Communication and the other for consultation on the content of the White Paper as a whole.
A special series of Eurobarometer opinion surveys will be launched in spring 2006 to provide the best possible data for analysis. 5.2.
As the European Council emphasised once again in its conclusions of June 2005, the responsibility for "Communicating Europe" is shared between the Community institutions, particularly the Commission, and the national, regional and local authorities in the Member States.
The Commission's special role, as underlined by the European Council, is to develop a broad framework for action and coordinate the activities undertaken by all the partners . 5.3.
