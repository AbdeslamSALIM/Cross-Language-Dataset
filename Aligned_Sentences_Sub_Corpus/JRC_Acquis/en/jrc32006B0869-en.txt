A supplementary adjustment, to take into account the so-called 'indirect effect’ of the UK correction on the uniform rate of call of the VAT-based own resource, is also financed in chapter 3 5 of the AB 3/2006.
This 'indirect effect’ corresponds to a decrease of € 9998501 for the United Kingdom, so that the total amount entered in chapter 3 5 of the AB 3/2006 for the United Kingdom is an increase of € 114429130.

Correction for the United Kingdom = (9) – (10) | | 5425348070 | Note: The difference of € 239664390 between the updated amount of the 2004 UK correction (€ 5425348070, as calculated above) and the previously budgeted amount of the 2004 UK correction (€ 5185683679, entered in the AB 5/2005) is financed in chapter 3 6 of the AB 3/2006.
A supplementary adjustment, to take into account the so-called 'indirect effect’ of the UK correction on the uniform rate of call of the VAT-based own resource, is also financed in chapter 3 6 of the AB 3/2006.
This 'indirect effect’ corresponds to an increase of € 14680207 for the United Kingdom, so that the total amount entered in chapter 3 6 of the AB 3/2006 for the United Kingdom is an increase of € 254334597.
