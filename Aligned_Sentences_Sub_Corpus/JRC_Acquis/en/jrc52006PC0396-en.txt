The revision of the third package aims to increase market efficiency, to enhance the safety of air services and to improve passenger protection. | 120 | General context On 23 July 1992 the final stage in the liberalisation of air transport in the Community was reached with the adoption of the three Council Regulations - No 2407/92, 2408/92 and 2409/92 - known as the "third package".
The Commission received 56 response(s).
The results are available on http://europa.eu.int/comm/transport/air/rules/package_3_en.htm. | Collection and use of expertise | 229 | There was no need for external expertise. | 230 | Impact assessment The revision of the third package does not intend to radically change the legal framework, but rather to make a series of adjustments in order to address the identified problems.
The three existing regulations of the third package will be consolidated into a single text. | 310 | Legal basis This draft regulation that repeals regulations (EEC) No 2407/92, 2408/92 and 2409/92 is based on article 80 (2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. | 320 | Subsidiarity principle The subsidiarity principle applies insofar as the proposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the Community. | The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States for the following reason(s). | 321 | - The experience with the third package on the internal aviation market has shown that the legislation is not interpreted and applied in a uniform way across Member States.
In addition, given the now simplified structure of the regulations, they have been consolidated into one single text. | 515 | The proposal is included in the Commission's rolling programme for up-date and simplification of the acquis communautaire and its Work and Legislative Programme under the reference 2002/TREN/28. | 520 | Repeal of existing legislation The adoption of the proposal will lead to the repeal of existing legislation. | 560 | European Economic Area The proposed act concerns an EEA matter and should therefore extend to the European Economic Area. | 570 | Detailed explanation of the proposal 1.
The proposal clarifies the rules applicable to public service obligations (PSO) (articles 16, 17 and 18) The rules applicable to public service obligations have been revised in order to lighten the administrative burden, to avoid excessive recourse to PSO and to attract more competitors in the tender procedures.
The experience with the application of the third package on air transport liberalisation has shown that there has not been any market failure that would justify maintaining in force specific provisions regulating air fares such as the safeguard measures provided in article 6 of regulation (EEC) No 2409/92.
In this context, and in the light of the general competition rules, these sector-specific measures are removed from the regulation. | E-14676 | - ê 2407/92 - 2408/92 - 2409/92 (adapted) 2006/0130 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on common rules for the operation of air transport services in the Community (Text with EEA relevance) Ö THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND Õ THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 84(2) Ö 80(2) Õ thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], Having regard the opinion of the European Parliament, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[2], ò new Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[3], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[4], Whereas: (1) A number of substantial changes are to be made to Council Regulations (EEC) No 2407/92 of 23 July 1992 on licensing of air carriers[5], (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access of Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes[6] and (EEC) No 2409/92 of 23 July 1992 on fares and rates for air services[7].
