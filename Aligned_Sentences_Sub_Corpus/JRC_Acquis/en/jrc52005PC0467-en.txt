Proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008) {SEC(2005) 1202} /* COM/2005/0467 final - COD 2005/0203 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 5.10.2005 COM(2005) 467 final 2005/0203 (COD) Proposal for a DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL concerning the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008) (presented by the Commission) {SEC(2005) 1202} EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1) CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL - Reasons for the proposal Intercultural dialogue is intimately linked to the fundamental ambition underlying the construction of Europe, namely to bring together the peoples of Europe.
In this spirit, the Commission proposes that 2008 be declared the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. - Provisions in force in the field covered by the proposal There are no provisions in force in the field covered by the proposal concerning intercultural dialogue as such, but many projects financed under various Community programmes contribute directly or indirectly to the development of such a dialogue. - Coherence with other policies and objectives of the Union The European Year of Intercultural Dialogue proposed for 2008 will articulate and give concrete form to a number of fundamental principles of the European Union: - The Treaty establishing the European Community gives it the task of creating an ever-closer union between the peoples of Europe and of contributing to the flowering of the cultures of Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and also highlighting their common cultural heritage.
The flagship action has been the creation in 2005 of the Anna Lindh Foundation for the Dialogue between cultures in Alexandria, Egypt.
The European Year will provide an opportunity to strengthen this “mainstreaming” in all relevant Community programmes and actions in 2008 in order to raise the profile and increase the overall impact of these actions in the context of the Year.
Regulatory action : Article 151 of the Treaty excludes "any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States".
These action lines are, in turn, based on the richness and diversity of a critical mass of specific projects to be implemented in 2008 through Community programmes and other relevant actions.
The Community may provide non-financial support, including written authorisation to use the logo and other material associated with the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, to initiatives from public or private organisations, in so far as they can assure the Commission that the initiatives in question are or will be carried out during 2008 and are likely to make a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
Initiatives organised in third countries in association or cooperation with the Year, but not supported financially by it, may also benefit from non-financial support from the Community and use the logo and other material associated with the Year. - Legal basis Article 151 of the EC Treaty. - Principle of subsidiarity The principle of subsidiarity applies in so far as the proposal does not affect an area where the Community has exclusive competence.
The scale of participation in a limited time frame may help to enhance the Union’s political priorities; - apart from the effects of this strengthening of the mainstreaming of intercultural dialogue within Community programmes, the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue will concentrate on actions with a clear Community added value, leaving it to Member States to mobilise players at regional and local level in accordance with individual situations. - Principle of proportionality As the Year is based on a critical mass of projects supported by Community programmes, it may carry out a significant Community development action with a budget estimated at 10 million €.
At the same time it is an increasing factor in the European Union’s external relations, particularly with regard to the candidate countries, the countries of the western Balkans and the partner countries of the European neighbourhood policy[7]. (7) Building on this diversified basis of Community experiences and initiatives, involving each citizen and European society as a whole in an intercultural dialogue approach is a fundamental step. (8) For the purpose of the present decision, the notion of “active European citizenship” does not cover only citizens of the European Union as defined in Article 17 of the EC Treaty, but any individual living permanently or temporarily in the European Union. (9) The common values of the European Union are those defined in Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union. (10) It is important to ensure complementarity with all Community, national, regional and local actions with a strong intercultural dialogue dimension.
It will be also important to ensure complementarity with any other initiative of cooperation with third countries, in particular developing countries, relevant for the objectives of intercultural dialogue of the European Year of Intercultural dialogue. (12) This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
An advisory committee is thus considered appropriate to the type and scale of the action envisaged. (15) As the objectives of the action envisaged cannot be achieved to a sufficient degree by the Member States owing to the need, in particular, for multilateral partnerships and transnational exchanges on a Community scale and may therefore, owing to the dimension of the action, be better carried out at Community level, the Community may take measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in Article 5 of the Treaty.
Article 2 Objectives 1.

With regard to the Community actions financed under this Decision, the notion of irregularity referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 shall mean any infringement of a provision of Community law or any infringement of a contractual obligation resulting from an act or omission by an economic operator which has, or would have, the effect of prejudicing the general budget of the Communities or budgets managed by them, by an unjustified item of expenditure. 3.
The Commission shall reduce, suspend or recover the amount of financial assistance granted for an action if it finds irregularities, particularly non-compliance with the provisions of this Decision, the individual decision or the contract granting the financial support in question, or if it transpires that, without Commission approval having being sought, the action has been subjected to significant change which conflicts with its nature or with its implementing conditions. 4.
The Commission shall take every other step necessary to verify that the actions financed are carried out properly and in compliance with the provisions of this Decision and the Financial Regulation (Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002).
