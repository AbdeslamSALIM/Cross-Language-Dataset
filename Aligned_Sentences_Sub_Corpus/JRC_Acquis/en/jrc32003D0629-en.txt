For the Commission Erkki Liikanen Member of the Commission (1) OJ L 40, 11.2.1989, p. 12. (2) OJ L 220, 30.8.1993, p. 1. (3) OJ L 133, 6.6.2000, p. 26.
The addition of the symbol 'C' indicates that the product also satisfies the 'self-closing' criterion (pass/fail test) (*).%quot%; (iii) the table applying to %quot%wall and ceiling coverings%quot% is replaced by the following: %quot%%gt%TABLE%gt% Notes The suffixes '1' and '2' indicate which substrates, fire behaviour criteria and extension rules are used in this classification.%quot% (d) the following point 7 is added: %quot%7.
In addition, the symbols 've' and/or 'ho' indicate the suitability for vertical and/or horizontal use. 'S' indicates a leakage rate of less than 5 m3/hr/m2 (All ducts without an 'S' classification must have a leakage rate of less than 10 m3/hr/m2) '500', '1000', '1500' indicate the suitability for use up to these values of pressure, measured at ambient. %gt%TABLE%gt% Notes The classification is completed by the suffix 'single' to indicate suitability for single compartment use. 'HOT 400/30' (high operational temperature) indicates that the damper has the ability to be opened or closed during a period of 30 minutes under temperature conditions below 400 °C (to be used only with E600 classification). 'ved', 'vew' 'vedw' and/or 'hod', 'how' 'hodw' indicate the suitability for vertical and/or horizontal use, together with mounting in a duct or in a wall or both respectively. 'S' indicates a leakage rate of less than 200 m3/hr/m2.
Leakage rates are both at ambient and elevated temperatures. '500', '1000', '1500' indicates the suitability for use up to at these values of under pressure, measured at ambient. 'AA' or 'MA' indicates automatic activation or manual intervention 'io', 'i o', 'i [harr ]o', indicates the performance criteria are satisfied from inside to outside, outside to inside or both respectively. 'C300', 'C10000', 'Cmod' indicates the suitability of the damper for use in smoke control only systems combined smoke control and environmental systems, or modulating dampers used in combined smoke control and environmental systems respectively. %gt%TABLE%gt% Notes The classification is completed by the suffix 'multi' to indicate suitability for multi-compartment use. 'HOT 400/30' (high operational temperature) indicates that the damper has the ability to be opened or closed during a period of 30 minutes under temperature conditions below 400 °C. 'ved', 'vew' 'vedw' and/or 'hod', 'how' 'hodw' indicate the suitability for vertical and/or horizontal use, together with mounting in a duct or in a wall or both respectively. 'S' indicates a leakage rate of less than 200 m3/hr/m2.
Leakage rates are both at ambient and elevated temperatures. '500', '1000', '1500' indicates the suitability for use up to these values of pressure, measured at ambient.

'C300', 'C10000', 'Cmod' indicates the suitability of the damper for use in smoke control only systems, combined smoke control and environmental systems, or modulating dampers used in combined smoke control and environmental systems, respectively. %gt%TABLE%gt% Notes 'A' can be any time over 120 minutes. %gt%TABLE%gt% Notes %gt%TABLE%gt% Notes Where θ indicates the exposure condition (temperature).%quot%
