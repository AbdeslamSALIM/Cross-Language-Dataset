Opinion of the European Central Bank of 1 December 2005 on a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 974/98 on the introduction of the euro (CON/2005/51) Opinion of the European Central Bank of 1 December 2005 on a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 974/98 on the introduction of the euro (CON/2005/51) (2005/C 316/11) On 10 November 2005 the European Central Bank (ECB) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on a "Proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 974/98 on the introduction of the euro" (COM(2005) 357 final) [1] (hereinafter the "proposed regulation").
General remarks 1.1.
The EU in general and the Member States that have already adopted the euro (hereinafter the "participating Member States") also have a strong interest in ensuring that any future euro area enlargement is implemented as smoothly and successfully as was the case for the adoption of the euro by the original 11 participating Member States and Greece, so that the enlargement of the euro area will have a positive impact.
In particular, a number of the Member States which acceded to the EU on 1 May 2004 [4] have indicated publicly that they have a preference for the euro to be introduced in accordance with a "big bang" scenario.
Under the existing provisions of Regulation (EC) No 974/98, "transitional period" is defined as a three-year period beginning on 1 January 1999 and ending on 31 December 2001, except in the case of Greece, where the transitional period is a one-year period beginning on 1 January 2001 and ending on 31 December 2001 [6].
First, the practical aspects of the euro changeover are different today compared to the original euro changeover which began on 1 January 1999, when the euro banknotes and coins were not in existence.
The experience of the original 11 participating Member States suggests that the wholesale banking sector and financial markets can be expected to switch to the euro unit at the very beginning of the transitional period.
This suggests that if a Madrid-style transitional period is used for any further introductions of the euro, the transitional period should be shorter than three years. 2.2.6.
Thus, establishing a maximum of three years for the transitional period would be consistent with the principle of equal treatment, taking account of the three-year transitional period applicable to the original 11 participating Member States under Regulation (EC) No 974/98.
The proposed regulation sets a maximum length of one year for the phasing-out period [14].
Regulation (EC) No 974/98 establishes the maximum length of the dual circulation period as six months [15]. 2.2.8.
Second, it is suggested to simplify the first paragraph of the proposed Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 974/98 to provide that "with effect from the respective cash changeover dates, the ECB and the national central banks of the participating Member States shall put into circulation banknotes denominated in euro in the participating Member States." 2.5.3.
