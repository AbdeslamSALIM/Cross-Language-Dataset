General (1) On 28 January 2004, the Commission announced, by a notice (notice of initiation) published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2], the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of polyester high tenacity filament yarn originating in Belarus, the Republic of Korea (Korea) and Taiwan. (2) The proceeding was initiated as a result of a complaint lodged in December 2003 by the Comité International de la Rayonne et des Fibres Synthétiques (CIRFS) (the complainant), acting on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 70 %, of the total Community production of polyester high tenacity filament yarn.
The complaint contained evidence of dumping of the said product and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding. (3) Subsequently one of the complaining producers, KoSa, withdrew its support for the complaint on 8 March 2004.
In the meantime a Spanish producer, Brilén, expressed its willingness to co-operate in the proceeding and expressed its support for the complaint.
On 16 June 2004, CIRFS withdrew its complaint by stating that it had serious doubts that the proceeding will resolve satisfactorily the problems of dumping and resultant injury to all Community producers.
Since Acordis and Brilén account together for 40 % of the total Community production of polyester high tenacity yarn, it was decided that there was still sufficient standing to continue the investigation. 2.
Interested parties were given an opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation. (5) One exporting producer in Belarus, three exporting producers in Korea, and two exporting producers in Taiwan, as well as three producers in the Community, forty users, two associations of users and three importers made their views known in writing.
However, given the lower than expected number of exporting producers in Korea and of importers in the Community which indicated their willingness to co-operate, it was decided that sampling was not necessary. 3.
Questionnaires (7) The Commission sent questionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to all other companies who made themselves known within the deadlines set in the notice of initiation. (8) Replies were received from six exporting producers (one from Belarus, three from Korea and two from Taiwan), from one complainant Community producer and two additional producers in the Community, from five user companies and from three importers. (9) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of dumping, resulting injury and Community interest.
Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following companies: (a) Producers in the Community: - Acordis, Arnhem, the Netherlands, - Brilén SA, Barbastro, Spain. (b) Importers in the Community: - Pössiger GmbH, Rosendahl, Germany, - Mitsui Ltd., London, United Kingdom. (c) Users in the Community: - Cordstrap, Deurne, the Netherlands, - Güth %amp% Wolf, Gütersloh, Germany, - OLBO Industrietextilien GmbH, Solingen, Germany, - Gurt %amp% Bandweberei Oppermann GmbH, Einbeck, Germany. (d) Exporting producers in Korea: - Honeywell Sysko Co., Inc., Seoul, Korea, - Hyosung Corporation, Seoul, Korea, - Kolon Industries Inc., Seoul, Korea. (e) Exporting producers in Taiwan: - Far Eastern Textiles Co.
Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan, - Shinkong Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan. (f) Related importers in the Community: - Honeywell Performance Fibers, Longwy, France, - Hyosung Deutschland GmbH, Neu-Isenburg, Germany. (10) The investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003 (the IP).
Like product (13) No differences were found between the product concerned exported from Belarus, Korea and Taiwan to the Community and the product produced and sold on the domestic market in Korea and Taiwan.
whether the total volume of such sales was equal to or greater than 5 % of the total volume of the corresponding export sales to the Community. (18) The Commission subsequently identified those types of the like product sold domestically by the companies having overall representative sales which were identical or directly comparable to the types sold for export to the Community. (19) Additionally and for each product type sold by the exporting producer on the domestic market, which was found to be directly comparable with the type sold for export to the Community, it was established whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation.
Domestic sales of a particular product type were considered as sufficiently representative when the total domestic sales volume of that type during the IP represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the comparable product type exported to the Community. (20) The Commission subsequently examined whether the domestic sales of each company could be considered as being made in the ordinary course of trade pursuant to Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation.
This was done by establishing the proportion of profitable domestic sales to independent customers, of each exported product type: (a) for those product types where more than 80 % by volume of sales on the domestic market were not below unit costs, and where the weighted average sales price was equal to or higher than the unit cost, normal value, by product type, was calculated as the weighted average of all domestic sales prices of the type in question; (b) for those product types where at least 10 %, but no more than 80 %, by volume of sales on the domestic market were not below unit costs, normal value, by product type, was calculated as the weighted average of domestic sales prices which were found to be equal to or above unit costs only, of the type in question; (c) for those product types where less than 10 %, by volume of sales, on the domestic market, were not below unit costs, it was considered that the product type concerned was not sold in the ordinary course of trade. (21) For sales of product types not made in the ordinary course of trade, as well as for product types which were not sold in representative quantities on the domestic market, normal value had to be constructed. (22) To construct normal value pursuant to Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation, the selling, general and administrative (SG%amp%A) expenses incurred and the weighted average profit realised by each of the co-operating exporting producers concerned on domestic sales of the like product, in the ordinary course of trade, during the investigation period, was added to their own average cost of production during the investigation period.
Export price (23) In all cases where the product concerned was exported to independent customers in the Community, the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, namely on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable. (24) In the case where sales were made via a related importer, the export price was constructed on the basis of the resale price to independent customers in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation.
For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences affecting prices and price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.
Appropriate adjustments were granted in all cases where they were found to be reasonable, accurate and supported by verified evidence. 1.4.
The export price was therefore established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable. 2.4.
Comparison (37) In order to ensure a fair comparison, account was taken, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, of differences in factors which affect price comparability.
Allowances for differences in transport costs, freight and insurance costs, handling, loading and ancillary costs, import charges and indirect taxes, credit costs, after-sales costs, commissions, discounts and rebates were granted where applicable and justified. (38) JSC "Mogilevkhimvolokno" claimed that, if its products, in spite of the arguments mentioned in recital 14 above, were to be considered like products, an adjustment would be appropriate due to the alleged differences in quality and uses.
Republic of Korea 3.1.
Normal value for these product types was based on the actual prices paid or payable, by independent customers in the domestic market of Korea, during the investigation period, in accordance with Article 2(1) of the basic Regulation. (42) For sales of product types not made in the ordinary course of trade, as well as for product types which were not sold in representative quantities on the domestic market, normal value had to be constructed.
Consequently, the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation on the basis of the prices at which the products were first resold to an independent buyer and in accordance with the methodology described in recital 24. (44) The remaining exports of the product concerned by two exporting producers were made directly to independent customers in the Community.
Comparison (45) In order to ensure a fair comparison, account was taken, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, of differences in factors which affect price comparability.
Dumping margins (51) As provided by Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, for each company the adjusted weighted average normal value established for each product type was compared with the adjusted weighted average export prices of each corresponding product type. (52) On this basis, the dumping margins, expressed as a percentage of the cif import price at the Community border, duty unpaid, are the following: Honeywell Sysko Co., Inc. | 4,5 % | Hyosung Corporation | 0 % | Kolon Industries Inc. | 0 %. | (53) With regard to imports originating in Korea, it should be noted that the three exporting producers above represent the entirety of exports originating in this country when compared to the Eurostat data.
In order to assess whether, on a countrywide basis, the dumping margin was below de minimis, a weighted average countrywide dumping margin was established.
Normal value for these product types was based on the actual prices paid or payable, by independent customers in the domestic market of Taiwan, during the investigation period, as set out in Article 2(1) of the basic Regulation. (55) For sales of product types not made in the ordinary course of trade, as well as for product types which were not sold in representative quantities on the domestic market, normal value had to be constructed.
Export price (56) All sales of the product concerned made by the two exporting producers on the Community market were made directly to independent customers in the Community.
Consequently, the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable. 4.3.
Comparison (57) In order to ensure a fair comparison, account was taken, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, of differences in factors which affect price comparability.
Dumping margins (58) As provided by Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, for each company the adjusted weighted average normal value established for each product type was compared with the adjusted weighted average export prices of each corresponding product type. (59) On this basis, the dumping margins, expressed as a percentage of the cif import price at the Community border, duty unpaid, are the following: Far Eastern Textiles Corporation | 5,5 % | Shinkong Corporation | 0 % | (60) Since the level of co-operation was high (more than 80 % of the exports of the product concerned from Taiwan to the Community), the residual dumping margin was set at the same level as the one established for the co-operating exporting producer Far Eastern Textiles Corporation, namely 5,5 %.
They are deemed to constitute the Community industry within the meaning of Article 4(1) and Article 5(4) of the basic Regulation and will hereafter be referred to as the "Community industry". (65) Given that the Community industry comprises only two producers, data relating to the Community industry had to be indexed in order to preserve confidentiality, pursuant to Article 19 of the basic Regulation. 2.
Community consumption (66) Community consumption was established on the basis of the production of all producers of the like product in the Community, as estimated by the complainant, plus imports from all countries as reported by Eurostat, less exports to all countries as reported by Eurostat. (67) The Community consumption was found to have remained substantially stable for the period considered as it increased by only 1 %.
Detailed data is as follows: Consumption | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 (IP) | Tonnes | 206000 | 206900 | 207900 | 207400 | Index | 100 | 100 | 101 | 101 | 3.
Volume of the dumped imports and market share (68) Given that there was only one Taiwanese exporting producer of the product concerned found to be dumping during the IP, data relating to imports of the product concerned into the Community from that exporting producer had to be indexed in order to preserve confidentiality pursuant to Article 19 of the basic Regulation. (69) Information regarding volumes of dumped imports for the period between 2000 and the IP is based on that supplied by the co-operating exporting producer who was found to be dumping in the IP.
Dumped imports originating in Taiwan decreased by 16 % between 2000 and 2001, but increased significantly in 2002 and during the IP for a total increase of 112 % during the period considered.
It should be noted that such market share was limited during the period considered and was always below 4 %.
Import Prices | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 (IP) | EUR (per tonne) | Cannot be disclosed (see recital 68 above) | Index | 100 | 99 | 80 | 71 | (b) Price undercutting (72) A comparison for comparable models of the product concerned was made between the exporting producer’s and the Community industry's average selling prices in the Community.
The comparison showed that during the IP the product concerned originating in Taiwan sold in the Community undercut the Community industry's prices by around 25 %-30 %. 5.
At the same time, the market share decreased by 3 % between 2000 and 2002, but subsequently increased by 5 % in the IP for a total increase of 2 % in the period considered.
The Community industry held a market share between 20 % and 30 % throughout the period considered.
Prices subsequently fell by 12 % in 2002 and fell further by 5 % in the IP, for a total decrease of 13 % during the period considered.
It did not follow the decrease in sales prices to the same extent in 2002 and the IP.
Profitability | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 (IP) | Profitability (EC sales) | Cannot be disclosed (see recital 65 above) | Index | 100 | 92 | 28 | – 22 | (83) It should be noted that one company claimed that their profitability would have been significantly worse if account had been taken of costs relating to underutilisation of their production facility.
It has to be noted that investments in 2000 were particularly high due to the expenses for building a new plant of one of the Community producers which accounts for roughly 50 % of all investments in that year.
Conclusion on injury (91) Between 2000 and the IP, the volume of the dumped imports of the product concerned originating in Taiwan increased significantly by 112 %.
However, as imports from Taiwan are relatively low in absolute figures, their share of the Community market increased by less than 2 %.
Sales in the Community increased by 3 %, increasing the market share by 2 %.
Production per employee increased by 16 % while labour costs per employee increased only by 4 % (below the average EU inflation rate of 6,4 % over the period considered). (93) Other indicators show a deterioration in the situation of the Community industry over the period considered.
Over the period considered, the unit sales price declined by 13 % while the unit cost of production increased by 2 %, resulting in negative profitability.
Employment decreased by 10 % and investment declined by 49 % (largely due to the building of a new plant in 2000 which accounted for roughly 50 % of total investments in that year). (94) In the light of the foregoing, it is concluded that the Community industry has suffered material injury within the meaning of Articles 3(1) and 3(5) of the basic Regulation.
Effects of the dumped imports (96) During the period considered, the volume of dumped imports increased by 112 % and the price of dumped imports from Taiwan decreased by 29 %.
The Community industry's prices dropped by 13 % over the same period, at a time when the costs of production increased by 2 % thereby triggering a deterioration of profitability (around 10-15 percentage points over the period considered).
Under these circumstances, it was found that the dumped imports exerted a certain pressure on the Community industry’s prices and had some negative impact on the situation of the Community industry. (97) However, in assessing the effect of the dumped imports, it should also be considered that the volumes of dumped imports was always below 4 %, and that their market share increased over the period considered by less than two percentage points, remaining always below 4 %.
Effects of other factors Imports originating in other countries (98) Imports from other third countries decreased from 60075 tonnes in 2000 to 51813 tonnes in the IP, for an overall decrease of 14 %.
Average prices decreased from EUR 2,39 in 2000 to EUR 2,17 during the IP, an overall decrease of 9 %.
Although there are imports from a large number of other third countries, they individually account for less than 1 % of Community consumption during the period considered. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 (IP) | All Types | Tonnes | Market share | Price(EUR/kg) | Tonnes | Market share | Price(EUR/kg) | Tonnes | Market share | Price(EUR/kg) | Tonnes | Market share | Price(EUR/kg) | Belarus | 3459 | 1,7 % | 2,24 | 3920 | 1,9 % | 2,34 | 3842 | 1,8 % | 2,05 | 4683 | 2,3 % | 1,83 | Indexed | 100 | 100 | 100 | 113 | 113 | 104 | 111 | 110 | 92 | 135 | 134 | 82 | Japan | 2384 | 1,2 % | 2,61 | 2224 | 1,1 % | 2,77 | 5960 | 2,9 % | 2,28 | 5079 | 2,4 % | 2,15 | Indexed | 100 | 100 | 100 | 93 | 93 | 106 | 250 | 248 | 87 | 213 | 212 | 82 | Korea | 19962 | 9,7 % | 2,07 | 24381 | 11,8 % | 2,05 | 23021 | 11,1 % | 1,61 | 17264 | 8,3 % | 1,66 | Indexed | 100 | 100 | 100 | 122 | 122 | 99 | 115 | 114 | 78 | 86 | 86 | 80 | South Africa | 3533 | 1,7 % | 2,80 | 3236 | 1,6 % | 3,14 | 3071 | 1,5 % | 2,48 | 3318 | 1,6 % | 2,45 | Indexed | 100 | 100 | 100 | 91 | 91 | 112 | 86 | 86 | 89 | 93 | 93 | 88 | Switzerland | 10751 | 5,2 % | 3,13 | 9804 | 4,7 % | 3,40 | 11472 | 5,5 % | 2,65 | 7728 | 3,7 % | 3,16 | Indexed | 100 | 100 | 100 | 91 | 91 | 108 | 107 | 106 | 84 | 72 | 71 | 101 | USA | 6496 | 3,2 % | 2,50 | 3915 | 1,9 % | 3,28 | 2515 | 1,2 % | 2,90 | 3156 | 1,5 % | 2,20 | Indexed | 100 | 100 | 100 | 60 | 60 | 131 | 39 | 38 | 116 | 49 | 48 | 88 | Others | 13466 | 6,5 % | 2,12 | 9172 | 4,4 % | 2,34 | 9632 | 4,6 % | 2,32 | 10581 | 5,1 % | 2,35 | Indexed | 100 | 100 | 100 | 68 | 68 | 110 | 72 | 71 | 110 | 79 | 78 | 111 | Total | 60075 | 29,2 % | 2,39 | 56654 | 27,4 % | 2,52 | 59515 | 28,6 % | 2,12 | 51813 | 25,0 % | 2,17 | Indexed | 100 | 100 | 100 | 94 | 94 | 106 | 99 | 98 | 89 | 86 | 86 | 91 | (a) Imports not having a negative impact on the situation of the Community industry (99) Imports originating in South Africa decreased by 7 % during the period considered.
In addition, they represented a moderate market share of 3,7 % during the IP. (101) Imports originating in the USA decreased by 51 % during the period considered, and, based on Eurostat data, were undercutting the Community industry prices during the IP by less than 5 %.
They represented a market share of 2,3 % during the IP, but were significantly undercutting the Community industry prices during the IP by around 30 %.
Thus, imports from Belarus, Korea and the non-dumped imports from Taiwan had a clear impact on the Community industry.
Given (i) the limited market share of the dumped imports from Taiwan (less than 4 %) and the much more important market share of imports from countries other than Taiwan plus the non-dumped imports from Taiwan (around 13 %-14 %) and (ii) the undercutting practiced by these imports, it can be concluded that the injury suffered by the Community industry is to a substantial part caused by imports of high tenacity polyester yarns other than those from the dumping Taiwanese exporter.
Article 2 This Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
