The following shall be excluded from this Directive: - hot-water boilers capable of being fired by different fuels including solid fuels, - equipment for the instantaneous preparation of hot water, - boilers designed to be fired by fuels the properties of which differ appreciably from the properties of the liquid and gaseous fuels commonly marketed (industrial waste gas, biogas, etc), - cookers and appliances designed mainly to heat the premises in which they are installed and, as a subsidiary function, to supply hot water for central heating and sanitary hot water, - appliances with rated outputs of less than 6 kW using gravity circulation and designed solely for the production of stored sanitary hot water, - boilers manufactured on a one-off basis. 2.
In the case of boilers with a dual function, that of heating premises and also providing sanitary hot water, the efficiency requirements referred to in Article 5 (1) concern the heating function only.
Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that boilers cannot be put into service unless they satisfy the efficiency requirements set out in Article 5 (1) and the conditions for entry into service which the Member States lay down on the basis of local climatic conditions and the energy and occupancy characteristics of the buildings. 3.
The useful efficiency requirements to be complied with are set out in the following table: Type of boiler Range of power output Efficiency at rated output Efficiency at partload kW Average boiler-water temperature (in oC) Efficiency requirement expressed (in %) Average boiler-water temperature (in oC) Efficiency requirement expressed (in %) Standard boilers 4 to 400 70 %amp% {Ì8}; 84 + 2 logPn %amp% {Ì8}; 50 %amp% {Ì8}; 80 + 3 logPn Lowtemperature boilers (*) 4 to 400 70 %amp% {Ì8}; 87,5 + 1,5 logPn 40 %amp% {Ì8}; 87,5 + 1,5 logPn Gas condensing boilers 4 to 400 70 %amp% {Ì8}; 91 + 1 logPn 30 (**) %amp% {Ì8}; 97 + 1 logPn (*) Including condensing boilers using liquid fuels. (**) Temperature of boiler water-supply. 2.
Member States shall deem that boilers which comply with the harmonized standards, the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and for which the Member States have published the reference numbers of the national standards transposing those harmonized standards, to be in conformity with the essential efficiency requirements stipulated in Article 5 (1).
The conformity of series-produced boilers shall be certified by: - examination of the efficiency of a boiler type in accordance with module B as described in Annex III, - a declaration of conformity to the approved type in accordance with module C, D or E as described in Annex IV.
Until 31 December 1997, Member States shall permit the placing on the market and putting into service of appliances complying with the national rules and schemes in force within their territories on the date of the adoption of this Directive.
Article 11 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
