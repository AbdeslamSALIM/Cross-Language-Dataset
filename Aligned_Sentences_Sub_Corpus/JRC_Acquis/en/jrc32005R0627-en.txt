On 4 February 2005, the Commission imposed definitive safeguard measures by Commission Regulation (EC) No 206/2005 [3]. (2) On 23 October 2004, the Commission initiated an anti-dumping investigation on imports of farmed salmon originating in Norway.
On 22 April 2005, the Commission adopted provisional anti-dumping measures by Commission Regulation (EC) No 628/2005 [4].
CONSIDERATIONS (3) The imposition of definitive safeguard measures on imports of farmed salmon of all origins followed an investigation covering the period 2000 to 2003.
Having reached a provisional determination that, in the period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2004, imports from Norway have continued to increase and that there is injurious dumping, the Commission adopted provisional anti-dumping measures against imports of farmed salmon from Norway. (4) Imports of farmed salmon from Norway in the year ending 30 September 2004 represent around 60 % of the Community market and around 75 % of overall imports into the Community.
This Regulation shall enter into force on 27 April 2005.
