Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the &amp;lsquo;Proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 87/328/EEC as regards the storage of semen of bovine animals intended for intra-Community trade&amp;rsquo;(COM(2004) 563 final &amp;mdash; 2004/0188 CNS) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the "Proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 87/328/EEC as regards the storage of semen of bovine animals intended for intra-Community trade" (COM(2004) 563 final Ã¢&#x20AC;&#x201D; 2004/0188 CNS) (2005/C 157/12) On 20 September 2004 the Council decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 37 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned proposal.
At its 413th plenary session, held on 15 and 16 December 2004 (meeting of 15 December), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion with 139 votes in favour and seven abstentions. 1.
That could have avoided the present confusion and uncertainty about scope and definitions and dispensed with the need for the current additional legislative procedure. 2.2 Moreover, the proposed re-wording of Article 4 of Directive 87/328/EEC gives the impression that the scope of the approved storage centres is to be further widened to include the collection and processing of bovine semen, thereby establishing a parallel system of semen collection centres alongside those that exist at the moment.
Brussels, 15 December 2004.
