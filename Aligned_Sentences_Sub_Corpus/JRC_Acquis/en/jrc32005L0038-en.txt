Directive as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX I METHODS OF SAMPLING FOR OFFICIAL CONTROL OF THE LEVELS OF FUSARIUM TOXINS IN CERTAIN FOODSTUFFS 1.
Compliance with maximum limits laid down in Annex I to Regulation (EC) 466/2001 shall be established on the basis of the levels determined in the laboratory samples. 2.
General provisions 3.1.
In accordance with the point 4.3, large lots must be subdivided into sublots to be sampled separately. 3.3.
Specific provisions 4.1.
Without prejudice to the specific provisions set out in points 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5, the following formula may be used as a guide for the sampling of lots traded in individual packs, such as sacks, bags, retail packings. - weight: in kg - sampling frequency (SF): every nth sack or bag from which an incremental sample must be taken (decimal figures should be rounded to the nearest whole number). 4.2.
Weight of the incremental sample The weight of the incremental sample must be about 100 grams, unless otherwise defined in this Annex.
General survey of the sampling procedure for cereals and cereal products Table 1 Subdivision of lots into sublots depending on product and lot weight Commodity | Lot weight (tonnes) | Weight or number of sublots | No incremental samples | Aggregate sample Weight (kg) | Cereals and cereal products | ≥ 1500 | 500 tonnes | 100 | 10 | &gt; 300 and &lt; 1500 | 3 sublots | 100 | 10 | ≥ 50 and ≤ 300 | 100 tonnes | 100 | 10 | &lt; 50 | — | 3-100 [1] | 1-10 | 4.4.
Weight of the aggregate sample = 10 kg. - If it is not possible to carry out the method of sampling set out in this point because of the commercial consequences resulting from damage to the lot such as packaging forms, means of transport, an alternative method of sampling may be applied provided that it is as representative as possible and is fully described and documented. 4.5.
Sampling procedure for cereals and cereal products for lots &lt; 50 tonnes For lots of cereals and cereal products less than 50 tonnes, the sampling plan must be used with 10 to 100 incremental samples, depending on the lot weight, resulting in an aggregate sample of 1 to 10 kg.
For very small lots (≤ 0,5 tonnes) a lower number of incremental samples may be taken, but the aggregate sample uniting all incremental samples shall be also in that case at least 1 kg.
The figures in Table 2 may be used to determine the number of incremental samples to be taken.
Table 2 Number of incremental samples to be taken depending on the weight of the lot of cereals and cereal products Lot weight (tonnes) | No of incremental samples | ≤ 0,05 | 3 | &gt; 0,05-≤ 0,5 | 5 | &gt; 0,5-≤ 1 | 10 | &gt; 1-≤ 3 | 20 | &gt; 3-≤ 10 | 40 | &gt; 10-≤ 20 | 60 | &gt; 20-≤ 50 | 100 | 4.6.
Accordingly the number of incremental samples to be taken shall depend on the weight of the lot, with a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 100, in accordance with Table 2 at point 4.5.
For very small lots (≤ 0,5 tonnes) a lower number of incremental samples may be taken, but the aggregate sample uniting all incremental samples shall be also in that case at least 1 kg. - Weight of the incremental sample must be about 100 grams.
General requirements Methods of analysis used for food control purposes must comply with the provisions of items 1 and 2 of the Annex to Directive 85/591/EEC. 4.3.
Specific requirements 4.3.1.
Performance Criteria Where no specific methods for the determination of Fusarium toxins levels in foodstuffs are required by Community legislation, laboratories may select any method provided the selected method meets the following criteria: (a) Performance characteristics for deoxynivalenol Level μg/kg | Deoxynivalenol | RSDr % | RSDR % | Recovery % | &gt; 100-≤ 500 | ≤ 20 | ≤ 40 | 60 to 110 | &gt; 500 | ≤ 20 | ≤ 40 | 70 to 120 | (b) Performance characteristics for zearalenone Level μg/kg | Zearalenone | RSDr % | RSDR % | Recovery % | ≤ 50 | ≤ 40 | ≤ 50 | 60 to 120 | &gt; 50 | ≤ 25 | ≤ 40 | 70 to 120 | (c) Performance characteristics for Fumonisin B1 and B2 Level μg/kg | Fumonisin B1 or B2 | RSDr % | RSDR % | Recovery % | ≤ 500 | ≤ 30 | ≤ 60 | 60 to 120 | &gt; 500 | ≤ 20 | ≤ 30 | 70 to 110 | (d) Performance characteristics for T-2 and HT-2 toxin Level μg/kg | T-2 toxin | RSDr % | RSDR % | Recovery % | 50-250 | ≤ 40 | ≤ 60 | 60 to 130 | &gt; 250 | ≤ 30 | ≤ 50 | 60 to 130 | Level μg/kg | HT-2 toxin | RSDr % | RSDR % | Recovery % | 100-200 | ≤ 40 | ≤ 60 | 60 to 130 | &gt; 200 | ≤ 30 | ≤ 50 | 60 to 130 | The detection limits of the methods used are not stated as the precision values are given at the concentrations of interest.
Table 3 Numeric values to be used for α as constant in formula set out in this point, depending on the concentration of interest C (μg/kg) | α | ≤ 50 | 0,2 | 51-500 | 0,18 | 501-1000 | 0,15 | 1001-10000 | 0,12 | &gt; 10000 | 0,1 | 4.4.
The analytical result must be reported as x +/– U whereby x is the analytical result and U is the expanded measurement uncertainty.
