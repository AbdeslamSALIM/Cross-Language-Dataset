Common Position (EC) No 23/2005 of 12 April 2005 adopted by the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the management of waste from extractive industries and amending Directive 2004/35/EC Common Position (EC) No 23/2005 adopted by the Council on 12 April 2005 with a view to adopting Directive 2005/…/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of … on the management of waste from extractive industries and amending Directive 2004/35/EC (2005/C 172 E/01) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1], Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions [2], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [3], Whereas: (1) The Communication of the Commission entitled "Safe operation of mining activities: a follow-up to recent mining accidents" sets out as one of its priority actions an initiative to regulate the management of waste from the extractive industries.
The management of such waste should be subject to the provisions of Directive 75/442/EEC or of Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste [9], or any other relevant Community legislation, as is the case for waste generated at a prospecting, extraction or treatment site and transported to a location that is not a waste facility according to this Directive. (9) Nor should this Directive apply to waste resulting from the offshore prospecting, extraction and treatment of mineral resources or to the injection of water and re-injection of pumped groundwater, while inert waste, non-hazardous prospecting waste, unpolluted soil and waste resulting from the extraction, treatment and storage of peat should be covered only by a limited set of requirements due to their lower environmental risks.
However, these exemptions should not apply to Category A waste facilities. (10) Moreover, while covering the management of waste from the extractive industries which may be radioactive, this Directive should not cover such aspects as are specific to radioactivity. (11) In accordance with Directive 75/442/EEC and pursuant to Articles 31 and 32 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), the objective of management of waste generated by the extraction of materials used for their radioactive properties is to ensure protection of workers, the public and the environment against dangers stemming from ionising radiations.
This Directive is not applicable to the management of such waste where it is already covered by legislation based on the Euratom Treaty. (12) In order to remain true to the principles and priorities identified in Directive 75/442/EEC and, in particular, in Articles 3 and 4 thereof, Member States should ensure that operators engaged in the extractive industry take all necessary measures to prevent or reduce, as far as possible, any negative effects, actual or potential, on the environment or on human health which are brought about as a result of the management of waste from the extractive industries. (13) These measures should be based, inter alia, on the concept of best available techniques as defined in Directive 96/61/EC and, when such techniques are applied, it is for the Member States to determine how the technical characteristics of the waste facility, its geographical location and local environmental conditions can, where appropriate, be taken into consideration. (14) Member States should ensure that operators in the extractive industry draw up appropriate waste management plans for the treatment, recovery and disposal of extractive waste.
In addition, Member States should take the necessary measures to ensure that the competent authorities periodically reconsider and, where necessary, update permit conditions. (18) Member States should be required to ensure that, in accordance with the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters of 25 June 1998 (Aarhus Convention), the public are informed of the application for a waste management permit and the public concerned are consulted prior to the granting of a waste management permit. (19) It is necessary to indicate clearly the requirements with which waste facilities servicing the extractive industries should comply as regards location, management, control, closure and preventive and protective measures to be taken against any threat to the environment in the short and long-term perspectives, and more especially against the pollution of groundwater by leachate infiltration into the soil. (20) It is necessary to define clearly category A waste facilities used to service waste from the extractive industries, taking into account the likely effects of any pollution resulting from the operation of such a facility or from an accident in which waste escapes from such a facility. (21) Waste placed back into the excavation voids either for their rehabilitation or for construction purposes related to the mineral extraction process, such as the building or maintenance within voids of means of access for machinery, haulage ramps, bulkheads, safety barricades or berms, needs also to be subject to certain requirements in order to protect surface water and/or groundwater, secure the stability of such waste, and ensure appropriate monitoring upon cessation of such activities.
In addition, competent authorities should satisfy themselves that operators ensure suitable arrangements with respect to the construction and maintenance of a new waste facility or to any extension or modification of an existing waste facility, including in the after-closure phase. (23) It is necessary to establish monitoring procedures during the operation and after-closure of waste facilities.
In addition, in accordance with the polluter pays principle and with Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage [14], it is important to clarify that an operator of a waste facility servicing the extractive industries is subject to appropriate liability in respect of environmental damage caused by its operations or the imminent threat of such damage. (27) In the case of the operation of waste facilities servicing the extractive industries that are likely to have significant adverse transboundary effects on the environment and any resultant risks to human health, in the territory of another Member State, there should be a common procedure in place to facilitate consultation among neighbouring countries.
Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. (31) It is necessary for Member States to ensure that an inventory of closed waste facilities located on their territory which cause serious negative environmental impacts or have the potential of becoming in the medium or short term a serious threat to human health or the environment is carried out. (32) The Commission should ensure an appropriate exchange of scientific and technical information on how to carry out an inventory of closed waste facilities at Member State level and on the development of methodologies to assist Member States in complying with this Directive when rehabilitating closed waste facilities.
Such an approach is consistent with Article 6 of the Treaty, particularly with regard to integrating environmental protection requirements into the Community's policy in the sphere of development cooperation. (34) The objective of this Directive, that is to say, improving the management of waste from the extractive industries, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting alone because the mismanagement of such waste may cause pollution of a transboundary nature.
Therefore, since by reason of the scale and effects of this Directive, its objective can be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.

The Committee of the Regions delivered its opinion on 11 February 2004 [3]. 4.
The European Parliament adopted its opinion at first reading on 31 March 2004 [4]. 5.
On 12 April 2005, the Council adopted its common position in accordance with Article 251(2) of the Treaty.
In particular, elements of the amendments relating to the scope of the Directive, the definition of waste facility, the financial guarantee and the inventory of closed sites have been accepted in principle by the Council, subject to some adjustments (see paragraph 2 for specific comments). 2.
European Parliament Amendments In its plenary vote on 31 March 2004, the European Parliament, at first reading, adopted 74 amendments to the proposal.
Recitals Amendment 2: it has been clarified that wastes from the extractive industries have to be waste in accordance with the definition contained in the waste framework Directive in order for the minimum requirements of this Directive to apply.
Articles Amendment 13: the spirit of this amendment has been incorporated in recital 8.
Amendment 98: the European Parliament has proposed that a limited set of requirements apply to non-hazardous inert waste, unpolluted soil and non-hazardous prospecting waste.
In addition, the Council has included the possibility for Member States to reduce or waive certain requirements for non-hazardous non-inert waste, unless deposited in a category A waste facility.
Amendment 44: the prevention of soil pollution has been included as one of the measures the operator should take when placing extractive waste back into the excavation voids for rehabilitation and construction purposes.
Amendments 66, 67 and 68: these amendments correspond largely to what the Council has established in its common position: The procedures for the establishment of a financial guarantee shall be decided by the Member States, the Commission shall, to that end, establish technical guidelines (Article 22(1)(c)) and the commencement of any operations of deposit of waste in a waste facility is not possible without a guarantee (Article 7(2)(d)).
Amendments 71 and 72: the Council accepts the spirit of the amendment that an inventory of closed waste facilities which cause serious negative environmental impacts or have the potential of becoming, in the medium or short term, a serious threat to human health or the environment be drawn up.
Articles Amendments 42, 43 and 45: these amendments go beyond the scope of the proposal.
Amendments 9, 90, 22, 24, 26, 34, 38, 40, 41, 48, 53, 55, 56, 61 and 74: these amendments contain clarifications which the Council considered too detailed/prescriptive to include in a directive or which are already included in other articles of the proposal.
Amendment 90 has been included in recital 4.
Amendments 46, 54, 58 and 73: these amendments include references to Community legislation that is in any event applicable; these Community environmental standards have in any case to be met.
Amendments 62 and 64: Article 13(4) already requires Member States to make the disposal of extractive waste into any receiving body of water other than one constructed for the purpose of disposing of extractive waste conditional upon compliance by the operator with the relevant requirements of Directives 76/464/EEC, 80/68/EEC and 2000/60/EC.
CONCLUSION Despite the fact that the Council is not able to accept all the amendments adopted by the European Parliament, it considers that the common position coincides to a large extent with the concerns of the Parliament and is in line with the Commission's amended proposal.
