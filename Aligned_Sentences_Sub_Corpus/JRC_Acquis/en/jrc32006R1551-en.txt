Commission Regulation (EC) No%nbsp%1551/2006 of 17 October 2006 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain frozen strawberries originating in the People%rsquo%s Republic of China Commission Regulation (EC) No 1551/2006 of 17 October 2006 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain frozen strawberries originating in the People’s Republic of China THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Communities [1] (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 7 thereof, After consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: A.
INITIATION (1) On 19 January 2006 the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2] the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding with regard to imports into the Community of certain frozen strawberries originating in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). (2) The proceeding was initiated as a result of a complaint lodged on 5 December 2005 by the Polish Freezing Industry Union (the complainant) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 25 %, of the total Community production of certain frozen strawberries.
Interested parties were given an opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation. (4) The complainant producers, other cooperating Community producers, exporting producers, importers, users and user associations made their views known.
In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling would be necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all Community producers, exporting producers and unrelated importers were asked to make themselves known to the Commission and to provide, as specified in the notice of initiation, basic information on their activities related to the product concerned during the investigation period ( 1 January to 31 December 2005).
After examination of the information submitted, and given the low number of exporting producers in the PRC and unrelated importers which indicated their willingness to cooperate, it was decided that sampling was only necessary with regard to Community producers. (7) The Commission sent questionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to all other companies that made themselves known within the deadlines set out in the notice of initiation.
A total of 26 Community producers responded to the sample form.
INVESTIGATION PERIOD (IP) (11) The investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 January to 31 December 2005 (IP).
The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the period from 1 January 2002 to the end of the investigation period (period considered). 5.
Product concerned (13) The product concerned is strawberries, uncooked or cooked by steaming or boiling in water, frozen, whether or not containing added sugar or other sweeteners, originating in the People’s Republic of China currently classifiable within CN codes 08111011, 08111019 and 08111090.
The remaining four claims had to be rejected. (21) The following table summarises the determination for each company not granted MET, against each of the five criteria as set out in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation: Criteria | Company | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 1 | not met | not met | not met | met | met | 2 | not met | not met | not met | met | met | 3 | met | met | met | met | met | 4 | met | not met | met | met | met | 5 | not met | not met | not met | met | met | (22) On this basis, the following exporting producer in the PRC was granted MET: Yantai Yongchang Foodstuff. (23) Regarding the four companies that could not be granted MET, three of them were found not to meet criterion 1.
However, while the companies may have benefited from lower costs as a result of this mechanism, the effect on overall costs remains limited and any benefit to the companies from these lower costs could be corrected by a normal value adjustment. (25) None of the four companies that were not granted MET met criterion 2.
In two other cases, accounting inaccuracies were observed which are in conflict with international accounting standards.
INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT (IT) (27) Pursuant to Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, a country-wide duty, if any, is established for countries falling under that Article, except in those cases where companies are able to demonstrate that they meet all criteria set out in Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. (28) Individual treatment could be granted to the following exporting producer: Junao Foodstuff Co., Ltd. 8.
NORMAL VALUE 8.1.
No objections were raised to this choice of analogue country. (38) All known producers in Turkey were contacted and three companies accepted to cooperate.
on the basis of prices paid or payable, in accordance with the methodology set out above. (41) The domestic sales of the three Turkish producers of the like product were found to be representative compared to the product concerned exported to the Community by the exporting producers in the PRC. (42) The investigation showed that their sales volumes, sold at a net sales price equal to or above the unit cost, represented more than 80 % of the total sales volume of each producer.
EXPORT PRICES (43) As the product concerned was in all cases exported to independent customers in the Community, the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, namely on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable. 10.
For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences affecting prices and price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.
Regarding the normal value data stemming from the analogue country, an adjustment was made regarding physical differences pursuant to Article 2(10)(a) of the basic Regulation as it was found that strawberries produced and sold in Turkey were of better quality than those exported by Chinese producers (see recital 40).
This adjustment was provisionally estimated at 30 % of the Turkish sales value.
DUMPING MARGIN 11.1.
DETERMINATION OF DUMPING MARGINS FOR ALL OTHER EXPORTING PRODUCERS (48) In order to calculate the country-wide dumping margin applicable to all other exporters in the PRC, the Commission first established the level of cooperation.
A comparison was made between the total imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC calculated on the basis of Eurostat and the volume of exports as reported in the questionnaire replies submitted by the exporters in the PRC.
On this basis it was established that the level of cooperation was low, i.e. 37 % of the overall Chinese exports to the Community. (49) The dumping margin was consequently calculated as follows: The export price for cooperating exporters was established on the basis of the verified information they had provided.
Secondly, an export price was established on the basis of Eurostat data, thus counting the Eurostat-reported quantity that exceeded the quantities reported by cooperating exporters.
The use of Eurostat data was necessary in the absence of more information on export prices for determining the country-wide duty. (50) On this basis the country-wide level of dumping was provisionally established at 66,9 % of the CIF Community frontier price.
SAMPLING FOR INJURY ASSESSMENT PURPOSES (54) As explained in recital 10 above, in view of the large number of producers of frozen strawberries in the Community, the Commission selected a sample in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation consisting of eight producers that represented the largest representative volume of production that could reasonably be investigated within the time available. (55) The accumulated production of the eight Community producers selected for the sample that fully cooperated in the investigation was around 19200 tonnes during the IP, or around 14 % of the estimated total Community production of frozen strawberries. 16.
COMMUNITY CONSUMPTION (56) During the period considered the Community consumption developed as follows: Tonnes | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Community consumption | 202353 | 213083 | 238144 | 210285 | Index 2002 = 100 | 100 | 105 | 118 | 104 | (57) Community consumption was established on the basis of the total volume of production of frozen strawberries by the Community industry and other producers of the product in the Community plus imports from all third countries and excluding all exports.
The figures concerning the total production of the product concerned by the Community industry and other producers in the Community derive from estimates from the relevant authorities and associations in the Member States where frozen strawberries are produced, notably IERiGEZ for Poland, FruitVeb for Hungary, Assomela for Italy and the Ministry of Agriculture in Spain.
However, as neither reliable sales nor stock data could be obtained for all Community producers of the like product, data concerning the total production of the like product from all Community producers is considered to be the most reliable source. (59) As presented in the above table, the consumption of frozen strawberries in the Community has been relatively stable over the period considered with the exception of 2004 where consumption increased by 13 % in comparison to the previous year.
In the IP the consumption stabilised at the level of the years 2002 and 2003. 17.
Import volumes | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | PRC in tonnes | 8941 | 37925 | 30622 | 43025 | Index 2002 = 100 | 100 | 424 | 342 | 481 | Market shares of the imports | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | PRC | 4 % | 18 % | 13 % | 20 % | (61) Whereas the consumption of frozen strawberries remained relatively stable during the period considered, the imports from the country concerned have risen by around 381 % during the same period.
In consequence, the estimated market share of the PRC has increased significantly during the period considered from 4 % in 2002 to 20 % in the IP. 17.2.
EUR/tonne | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Import prices from the PRC | 745 | 738 | 605 | 461 | Index 2002 = 100 | 100 | 99 | 81 | 62 | (62) The above table shows the development of average import prices from the PRC.
Over the period considered prices fell continuously by a total of 38 %. (63) A comparison of selling prices on the Community market during the IP was made between the prices of the sampled Community industry and imports from the country concerned.
These prices were compared with the sales prices charged by the Chinese exporting producers net of discounts and adjusted where necessary to cif Community frontier with an appropriate adjustment for the customs clearance costs and post-importation costs. (64) The comparison showed that during the IP imports of the product concerned were sold in the Community at prices which undercut the Community industry’s prices, when expressed as a percentage of the latter by 6,0 % based on the data submitted by the cooperating exporting producers and by 6,4 % based on Eurostat data which covers all imports.
The second section relates to a set of data concerning all producers of the product concerned in the Community.
Situation of the Community industry (66) In accordance with Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation, the examination of the impact of the dumped imports on the Community industry included an evaluation of all economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry from 2002 to the IP. (67) The Community industry data below is the aggregated information of the eight cooperating Community producers included in the sample.
Production, production capacity and capacity utilisation (68) The table below indicates the evolution of production, production capacity and capacity utilisation of the sampled Community producers: | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Production (tonnes) | 26000 | 16555 | 26912 | 19198 | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 64 | 104 | 74 | Production capacity (tonnes) | 34546 | 36384 | 39934 | 39934 | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 105 | 116 | 116 | Capacity utilisation | 75 % | 46 % | 67 % | 48 % | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 60 | 90 | 64 | (69) As shown in the table above, production during the period considered decreased by 26 % while the capacity increased by 16 %.
The capacity utilisation decreased over the same period by 36 %.
The size and quality of the harvest is therefore decisive for the production volume of the product concerned.
Between 2004 and the IP, production dropped by 29 %.
However, bearing in mind that production of frozen strawberries is dependent on the size of the fresh fruit harvest, the fall in production from 2004 to the IP is not considered to be a useful injury indicator for this product. 18.1.2.
Stocks (71) The figures below represent the volume of stocks of the sampled Community industry at the end of each period. | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Stocks (tonnes) | 10969 | 9482 | 21055 | 13586 | Index 2002 = 100 | 100 | 86 | 192 | 124 | (72) It should be noted that stocked frozen strawberries must normally be consumed and thus sold within a one-year period in order to ensure that the characteristics in terms of taste and colour are preserved. (73) Stocks have increased considerably during the period considered.
The decrease in stock in the year 2003 was a result of the poor harvest that in turn had an impact on the availability of raw materials to the Community industry in this year.
In 2004 stocks increased significantly due to the abundant yield of the harvest 2004.
In comparison with 2002 the stocks increased by 92 % in 2004.
Following this peak, stock levels returned to more normal levels in the IP but were still 24 % higher than in 2002.
Between 2004 and the IP a rather massive sell off of the stocks took place to ensure that the frozen strawberries still had the required quality. 18.1.3.
Sales volume, market share and average sales prices (74) The figures below represent the sales volume, market share and average unit sales prices of the sampled Community industry. | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Sales volume of sampled Community industry in tonnes | 27428 | 18201 | 14647 | 26240 | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 66 | 53 | 96 | Market share | 13,6 % | 8,5 % | 6,2 % | 12,5 % | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 63 | 45 | 92 | Average sales prices (EUR/tonne) | 934 | 1382 | 1019 | 671 | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 148 | 109 | 72 | (75) The Community industry’s sales volumes and market share went down in 2003 as a result of the lack of raw materials i.e.
The sales and market share decreased even further in 2004 despite a return to normal production levels.
As mentioned above the drop in average prices was most significant between the year 2004 and the IP where a 34 % decrease in sales prices occurred.
Indeed, the massive sell off of stock from 2004 to the IP had to be made at very low prices. 18.1.4.
Profitability, return on investments and cash flow (77) The profitability shown below relates to sales on the Community market and is expressed as return on turnover (RoT), return on investments, (ROI) and cash flow. | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Profitability on Community sales (RoT) | 6,5 % | 9,4 % | –1,5 % | –12,5 % | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 144 | –23 | –191 | Return on investments (RoI) | 55 % | 36 % | –4 % | –24 % | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 66 | –7 | –44 | Cash flow (as percentage of turnover) | 2 % | 3 % | –1 % | 0 % | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 143 | –64 | 5 | (78) The RoT above shows a steep fall between 2002 and the IP.
Investments and ability to raise capital (80) The trend for the investments of the sampled Community industry is shown in the following table. | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Investments (EUR) | 3106428 | 9963701 | 10122277 | 12131394 | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 321 | 326 | 391 | (81) Despite the negative development seen for profitability above, the Community industry has increased its investments in the product concerned in order to improve its competitiveness in respect of the product concerned.
Employment, productivity and wages | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Number of employees | 390 | 301 | 445 | 368 | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 77 | 114 | 94 | Productivity (tonne/employee) | 67 | 55 | 60 | 52 | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 82 | 91 | 78 | Wages (EUR) | 2572050 | 1644557 | 2065347 | 2182047 | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 64 | 80 | 85 | (83) As seen above, the sampled Community industry adapted the number of employees in relation to the production levels.
The number of employees peaked in 2004 as a result of the return to high production volumes following the low volume of 2003.
The decrease in productivity per employee is largely explained by the sharp drop in production as a consequence from increased imports.
Macroeconomic data of Community production as a whole (86) The following data concerns the Community production as a whole. (87) It should be recalled from the consumption data, that no official figures on total Community sales volumes are available.
In order to estimate the total sales volume of producers active on the Community market, the production of the said producers was reduced by an amount for exports. | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Production volume available for sale (production minus exports) (tonnes) | 139705 | 108865 | 145596 | 124320 | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 78 | 104 | 89 | Market share | 69 % | 51 % | 61 % | 59 % | Indices 2002 = 100 | 100 | 74 | 89 | 86 | (88) As explained above, the above table is based on the relevant production volume minus exports.
Nevertheless, the above data would suggest a decrease over the period investigated, both in terms of total sales volume (– 11 %) and market share (– 14 %) of the Community industry as a whole. 18.3.
Moreover, in the IP, the sales prices of the Community industry were substantially undercut by those of the dumped imports of the product concerned by around 6 %. (91) As a consequence, during the period considered the situation of the Community industry substantially deteriorated.
Stock levels increased by 24 %, reaching serious levels at the end of 2004.
PRELIMINARY REMARK (96) In accordance with Article 3(6) and (7) of the basic Regulation, it was also examined whether there is a causal link between the dumped imports from the PRC and the injury suffered by the Community industry.
IMPACT OF THE IMPORTS FROM THE PRC (97) It is recalled that import volumes from the PRC increased by around 380 % and their estimated market share almost quadrupled during the period considered.
In addition, as has been explained at recital 62, import prices from the PRC fell by 38 % and substantial price undercutting was taking place. (98) The Community industry reacted to the large import volumes at sharply reduced price levels, by decreasing its sales price in 2004.
Despite this decrease, the average sales price of the Chinese imports remained more than 30 % lower than the Community industry’s prices.
The situation of the Community industry in the IP was further aggravated by the massive increase of more than 40 % in import volumes from the PRC.
It is therefore clear that there is a strong link between the significant increase in imports volumes at ever-lower prices and the injury observed with the Community industry. 21.
IMPACT OF IMPORTS FROM THIRD COUNTRIES (99) The volume of non-Chinese imports decreased by 20 % during the period considered.
It is therefore very unlikely that imports originating in other third countries, such as Morocco, could have contributed in any significant way to the injury suffered by the Community industry.
In addition, the average prices of imports from other third countries were in the IP 78 % higher than those originating in the PRC and around 20 % higher than those of the sampled Community industry.
The following table indicates the import volumes and average prices from imports originating in the main other third countries (i.e.
IMPACT OF CHANGES IN EXPORT PERFORMANCE OF THE COMMUNITY INDUSTRY (100) It has also been argued that a drop in the export performance, in particular to the US market, has contributed to the injury sustained by the Community industry.
According to Eurostat data, exports from the Community did indeed decrease over the period considered from around 19000 tonnes in 2002 to 15000 tonnes in 2005.
However, when compared with the Community market, the overall importance of the exports market is relatively limited, in fact exports correspond to less than 10 % of Community consumption throughout the period considered. (101) In terms of the indicators where the distinction between Community and export markets cannot be made, such as production and capacity utilisation, and also investments and employment, their negative evolution clearly exceeded what could be accounted for by the decrease in export performance.
As such, the negative evolution of those indicators must be seen both as a consequence of the decrease in sales in the Community market and of the decrease of export sales. (102) Regarding profitability, cash flow and return on investment, their negative evolution was partly a result of the Community industry being forced into very low capacity utilisation rates, due to the negative evolution of the sales volume in both the Community and export markets as mentioned above.
Moreover, the sales prices of the Community industry were under strong pressure from the dumped imports which also contributed to the negative impact upon those indicators. (103) Therefore, even if the decreased export performance of the Community industry might have contributed to the injury suffered, the overall effect cannot be considered as significant and cannot break the causal link between the dumped imports and the injury suffered by the Community industry. 23.
IMPACT OF DECREASED COMMUNITY INDUSTRY PRODUCTION AND ALLEGED DECREASE IN CONSUMPTION (104) It has been argued by one interested party that the poor harvests of 2002 and 2003 and the decrease in production linked to the lack of raw material, i.e.
However, this is unlikely to be the main factor responsible for the injury suffered.
In addition, an examination of the profitability of the Community industry over the period considered demonstrates that the industry continued to be profitable up to the year 2004 when there was a significant fall in prices of imports from the PRC. (105) It has also been argued that there has been a decrease in consumption of the product concerned on the Community market and that this decrease rather than the occurrence of dumped imports from the PRC is the reason behind the injury suffered by Community industry.
However, no specific evidence was provided in this respect.
Moreover, an analysis of the sampled Community producers’ sales and stock data as detailed in sections 18.1.2 and 18.1.3 do not support these allegations.
The high prices in 2003 coincided with high raw material costs due to the poor harvest of this season.
Stock levels at the end of this period were also the lowest recorded during the period considered.
Despite the decrease in sales prices, the Community industry was not able to sell off the produce in this year which resulted in a significant increase in end-of-year stock for 2004.
However, the main trigger for the price reduction was the need to react to the dumped prices of PRC imports that in this year had decreased by a further 24 % as compared with 2004. (110) Even if it was in theory possible for the Community industry to have sold off more of its stock in 2004, this would have been at heavily loss making prices.
Therefore it is clear that the Community industry was in an injurious situation in both 2004 and 2005.
The main problem confronting this industry was the increased volume of dumped imports at low prices levels, undercutting the prices if the Community industry rather than any management decisions as to the timing of selling off of the product concerned from stock. 26.
The dollar depreciation against the euro was around 34 % in the period concerned. (112) As regards the injury margins, the dollar depreciation may have encouraged increased imports to the Community of the product concerned.
Bearing in mind that the rapidly increasing imports from the PRC undercut substantially the Community industry prices, there is no indication that the above mentioned other factors could have been of such significance as to break the causal link between the imports of dumped products from the PRC and the material injury suffered by the Community industry.
No further other factors have been found in the course of the investigation that could have caused material injury. (114) Based on the above analysis of the effects of all known factors on the situation of the Community industry, it is provisionally concluded that there is a causal link between the dumped imports from the PRC and the material injury suffered by the Community industry.
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS (115) It has been examined whether compelling reasons exist that could lead to the conclusion that it would not be in the Community interest to impose anti-dumping duties against imports from the country concerned.
INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY INDUSTRY (116) The Community industry has been suffering from a surge in low-priced imports of frozen strawberries from the PRC.
For those that responded to the sampling questionnaire, the product concerned corresponded to more than 10 % of their entire business turnover.
Thus it is likely that those estimated 2700 jobs would have to be reduced significantly.
One additional unrelated importer and three importer associations made their views known through written and oral submissions. (121) Of the four companies which replied to the questionnaire, only three companies completed the section relating to the volume of imports.
This volume accounts for less then 5 % of the total imports of the product concerned from the PRC during the IP. (122) One cooperating importer agreed with the imposition of measures provided that these would be set for a limited period of time and takes a form that allows effective competition. (123) Two of the cooperating importers opposed the imposition of measures and stressed that such action would not be in the interest of the Community as the problem is confined only to Poland, suggesting the interest of only one Member State’s industry should be weighed against interests of several other Member States where the importers may suffer economical losses once anti-dumping duties are in place.
It was furthermore held by these cooperating importers that the imposition of measures would impede their contacts with exporting producers in the PRC as well as assistance provided to these in the form of training and education. (124) However, the purpose of the anti-dumping measures is neither to prohibit imports nor to hamper the activities of the importers in the Community.
Frozen strawberries usually do not represent more than 10 % of the total imports of such importers.
Therefore the effect of the duty will likely be diluted. (126) However, bearing in mind that the importers in this sector trade with both Polish and Chinese supplies and in view of the moderate duty rate that would be imposed, the market would not be closed to imports from the PRC, the impact on importers is not expected to be substantial.
INTEREST OF USERS 31.1.
In total, the user companies having submitted the relevant purchase data in the questionnaire reply accounted for an additional (to the 4 % accounted for by the importers) 12 % of imports to the Community from the country concerned.
The direct consumption of frozen strawberries by the catering industry and households is estimated not to exceed 20000 tonnes per year.
The estimated frozen strawberry consumption for this sector would amount to around 100000 tonnes per year.
It is estimated that some 110000 tonnes of strawberries are consumed by the fresh dairy and ice cream industry.
The processing companies cooperating in the investigation have argued that the imposition of measures would lead to a lack of supply of frozen strawberries for the sector, both in terms of quantities and in terms of the different qualities needed in the production.
In addition, the imposition of measures would run counter to the substantial investments carried out by the Chinese exporting producers and supported by users in view of ensuring that all applicable safety standards are met with the PRC exporting producers. (131) The production of frozen strawberries in the EU is mainly concentrated in Poland where production is almost exclusively focused on the freezing of the strawberry variety Senga Sengana.
It appears that Polish frozen strawberries together with import sources that will not be affected by anti-dumping duties (Turkey and Morocco) are able to guarantee steady supply of all strawberry varieties required by the processing (notably jam) industry. (132) PRC producers started exporting frozen strawberries in increased quantities only in 2003 (recital 60).
In that year, imports from the PRC increased by 324 %.
In turn, the Community processors seem to be far less reliant on frozen strawberries from the PRC, given their sourcing patterns before 2002 and the fact that they also import more important quantities from other sources such as Turkey and Morocco.
It was also argued that the increase in raw material costs for the processing industry with current market structure cannot be carried over to the retailer level of the distribution chain. (135) The user industry has demonstrated that the product concerned constitutes a substantial part of the cost of production of jams (around 30 % to 40 %).
Nevertheless it should be recalled that jams, according to the industry’s own admission generally, would consist of a blend of strawberries of different sources out of which that of Chinese origin would be limited to around 20 %.
On the contrary, these products typically make up merely 10 % of the total turnover of these companies.
On the whole, the effect of measures is therefore only likely to have a marginal effect on the total cost of production and profitability of users. (136) Moreover, with the number of operators on the European market and the large volumes of imports from a range of third countries, there is no risk that competition on the European market would be impeded even in the event that exports from the PRC would decrease substantially. 31.5.
Conclusion on users’ interest (137) Considering the above, it is unlikely that anti-dumping measures would lead to a shortage of supply or to a non-competitive situation on the Community market, in particular, as Chinese frozen strawberries are likely to retain a substantial market share and there are a number of other third country exporting producers.
Moreover, the user industry has pointed out that the Polish frozen strawberry production is essential to the fruit-processing industry and measures assisting in the upkeep of a viable Community production would ultimately also benefit the user industry.
Therefore, it is provisionally considered that the impact on users would not be substantial. 32.
It is estimated that the number of commercial producers in Poland decreased from 153000 in 1996 to 96700 in 2002.
Although it is expected that the consolidation in recent years has decreased this number even further, it is nevertheless clear that the farming of strawberries is an important economic activity for a large number of farms in Poland. (139) The price of fresh strawberries destined for the processing industry has traditionally fluctuated depending on the supply and the size of the harvest.
Should measures be imposed, the Community industry would probably be in a position to sell the product concerned at higher prices and thereby to offer higher prices to the suppliers of strawberries as well. (140) It is clear that measures would benefit the supplier sector by allowing them to operate at profitable levels. 33.
CONCLUSION ON COMMUNITY INTEREST (141) The imposition of measures on imports of frozen strawberries originating in the PRC would clearly be in the interest of the Community industry.
PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES 34.
INJURY ELIMINATION LEVEL (143) In view of the conclusions reached with regard to dumping, injury and Community interest, measures should be imposed in order to prevent further injury being caused to the Community industry by the dumped imports from the PRC. (144) The measures should be imposed at a level sufficient to eliminate the injury caused by these imports without exceeding the dumping margin found.
The pre-tax profit margin used for this calculation was 6,5 % of turnover based on average profit levels obtained prior to the existence of dumped imports in 2002.
Consequently, on the basis of the information available, it was preliminarily found that a profit margin of 6,5 % of turnover could be regarded as an appropriate level which the Community industry could be expected to obtain in the absence of injurious dumping.
The non-injurious price has been obtained by adding the above mentioned profit margin of 6,5 % to the cost of production. (145) The necessary price increase was then determined on the basis of a comparison of the weighted average import price with the average non-injurious price.
A 15,4 % allowance was added to the import prices to cover the normal customs duty (14,4 %) and importer handling charges (1 %). (146) Any difference resulting from this comparison was then expressed as a percentage of the average import cif value.
The investigation showed that the product concerned sold on the Community market by both exporting producers and Community industry was comparable.
This calculation was therefore made on an average to average basis. (147) The provisional weighted average injury margins for companies granted either MES or IT status were: Yantai Yongchang Foodstuff | 18,1 % | Dandong Junao Foodstuff | 12,6 % | (148) In order to calculate the country-wide injury elimination level for all other exporters in the PRC, it should be recalled that the level of cooperation was low.
The country-wide injury elimination level was 34,2 %, being the weighted average of the abovementioned two elements. 35.
PROVISIONAL MEASURES (149) In the light of the foregoing, it is considered that in accordance with the Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC should be imposed.
The anti-dumping duties should be set at the lower of the dumping and injury margins, in accordance with the lesser duty rule. (150) The individual company anti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation were established on the basis of the findings of the present investigation.
These duty rates (as opposed to the country-wide duty applicable to "all other companies") are thus exclusively applicable to imports of products originating in the country concerned and produced by the companies and thus by the specific legal entities mentioned.
that name change or that change in the production and sales entities.

The rate of the provisional anti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community frontier price, before duty, of the products described in paragraph 1, shall be as follows: Manufacturer | Anti-dumping duty % | TARIC additional code | Yantai Yongchang Foodstuff | 0 | A779 | Dandong Junao Foodstuff | 12,6 | A780 | All other companies | 34,2 | A999 | 3.
The release for free circulation in the Community of the product referred to in paragraph 1 shall be subject to the provision of a security, equivalent to the amount of the provisional duty. 4.
