Eligible expenditure will include the relevant personnel costs (wages and social security), approved depreciation of assets other than buildings directly assigned to the creation of video games and other operating expenditure, which is calculated at a flat-rate 75 % of personnel expenditure.
The tax credit rate is applied to that expenditure base.
As for proportionality, the Commission observes that the tax credit amounts to 20 % of expenditure, which is reasonable as long as eligible costs are properly defined and only production costs actually incurred are taken into account.
However, "other operating expenditure" (excluding personnel costs and depreciation) is calculated at a flat-rate 75 % of personnel expenditure.
In accordance with Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, any unlawful aid may be recovered from its beneficiary.
