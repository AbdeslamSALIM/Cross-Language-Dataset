Therefore a decision should be taken to postpone a decision on the possible inclusion of such active substances into Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. (7) Following discussions in the Standing Committee on Plant Health, and in accordance with the opinion of that Committee, the Commission has determined the further data required as a minimum to determine whether the substances mentioned in recital 4 satisfy the requirements of Article 5 of Directive 91/414/EEC.
Article 2 The rapporteur Member States shall inform the notifiers in relation to each active substance listed in the Annex to this Decision that they must complete their dossiers such that all data requirements of Annex II and Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC are satisfied for a limited range of representative uses.
Article 3 If for certain active substances the necessary information is not received by the dates specified in the Annex the rapporteur Member State shall inform the Commission as soon as possible and at the latest within two months.
