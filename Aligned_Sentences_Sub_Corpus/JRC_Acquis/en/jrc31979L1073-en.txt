On a horizontal support level with the reference point, there must be mounted two point sources of light, e.g. 2 Ä‚&#x2014; 150 W, 12 V, 65 mm apart and symmetrically located with respect to the reference point.
The silhouette (deepest shadow) overlaps projected on to the semi-circle of vision by the masking component when the light sources are switched on simultaneously or alternately must be measured in accordance with 1.4 (Figure 3). 2.2.1.2 to read as follows: Masking effects must not exceed 700 mm. 2.2.1.3 to read as follows: Masking effects due to adjacent structural components over 80 mm in width must be so configured that there is an interval of not less than 2 200 mm - measured as a chord of the semi-circle of vision - between the centres of two masking effects. 2.2.1.5 to read as follows: Outside the sector of vision, masking effects exceeding 700 mm but not exceeding 1 500 mm are, however, permissible if the components causing them cannot be redesigned or relocated : on each side there may be a total of either two such masking effects, one not exceeding 700 mm and the other not exceeding 1 500 mm, or two such masking effects, neither exceeding 1 200 mm. 2.2.2.1 to read as follow: As an alternative to the procedure set out in 2.2.1, the acceptability of individual masking effects can be determined mathematically.
