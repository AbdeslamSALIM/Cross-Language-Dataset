Given that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification , the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. 4.
The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 91/629/EEC of 19 November 1991 laying down minimum standards for the protection of calves[3].
Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table contained in Annex III to the codified Directive. ê 91/629/EEC (adapted) 2006/0097 (CNS) Proposal for a COUNCIL DIRECTIVE laying down minimum standards for the protection of calves THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article Ö 37 Õ thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[5], Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament[6], Whereas: ê (1) Council Directive 91/629/EEC of 19 November 1991 laying down minimum standards for the protection of calves[7] has been substantially amended several times[8].

It constitutes a source of revenue for part of the agricultural population. (5) Differences which may distort conditions of competition interfere with the smooth running of the organisation of the common market in calves and calf products. (6) There is therefore a need to establish common minimum standards for the protection of rearing calves or calves for fattening in order to ensure rational development of production. ê 97/2/EC Recital 4 (adapted) (7) It is recognised scientifically that calves should benefit from an environment corresponding to their needs as a herd-living species.
Calves, both group-housed and individually penned, must have sufficient space for exercise, contact with other cattle, and for normal movements when standing up or lying down. ê 91/629/EEC Recital 7 (8) It is necessary for official services, producers, consumers and others to be kept informed of developments in this field.
