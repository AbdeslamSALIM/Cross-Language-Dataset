ANNEX %quot%ANNEX D AFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS DIAGNOSIS Reagents for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) described below may be obtained from the European Community Reference Laboratory or the OIE Reference Laboratories for African horse sickness. 1.
The test protocol described hereinafter is used in the Regional Reference Laboratory for African horse sickness in Pirbright, United Kingdom. 1.1.
Test procedure 1.1.1.
Preparation of plates 1.1.1.1.
Coat ELISA plates with AHSV antigen extracted from infected cell cultures and diluted in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9,6.
Incubate the ELISA plates overnight at 4 °C. 1.1.1.2.
Wash plates three times by flooding and emptying the wells with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7,2 to 7,4 pH, and blot dry on adsorbent paper. 1.1.2.
Control wells 1.1.2.1.
Titrate the positive control sera in a twofold dilution series, from 1 in 5 to 1 in 640, across column 1 in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0,05 % (v/v) Tween-20, 5,0 % (w/v) skimmed-milk powder (Cadbury's MarvelTM) and 1 % (v/v) adult bovine serum) to give a final volume of 50 μl/well. 1.1.2.2.
Add 50 μl of the negative control serum at a dilution of 1 in 5 (10 μl serum + 40 μl blocking buffer) to wells A and B of column 2. 1.1.2.3.
Add 100 μl/well of blocking buffer to wells C and D of column 2 (blank). 1.1.2.4.
Add 50 μl of blocking buffer to wells E, F, G and H of column 2 (guinea pig control). 1.1.3.
Add a 1 in 5 dilution of each test serum in blocking buffer to duplicate wells of columns 3 to 12 (10 μl sera + 40 μl blocking buffer).
Prepare a twofold dilution series of each test sample (1 in 5 to 1 in 640) in blocking buffer across eight wells of single columns (3 to 12).
Add 50 μl of guinea pig antisera, pre-diluted in blocking buffer, to all wells except the blank wells of the ELISA plate (all wells now contain a final volume of 100 μl). 1.1.5.1.
Incubate for 1 hour at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. 1.1.5.2.
Wash plates three times and blot dry as before. 1.1.5.3.
Add 50 μl of rabbit anti-guinea-pig horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate pre-diluted in blocking buffer to each well. 1.1.5.4.
Incubate for 1 hour at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. 1.1.5.5.
Wash plates three times and blot dry as before. 1.1.6.
Add substrate (hydrogen peroxide = H2O2) to give a final concentration of 0,05 % (v/v) (1 in 2000 of a 30 % solution of H2O2).
Add 50 μl of the OPD solution to each well and leave plates on the bench for 10 minutes at ambient temperature.
Reading Read spectrophotometrically at 492 nm. 1.2.
The upper control limits (UCL) and lower control limits (LCL) for the guinea pig control are between OD values 1,4 and 0,4 respectively.
The end-point titre for the positive control based on 50 % PI should be 1 in 240 (within a range from 1 in 120 to 1 in 480).
The duplicate negative control serum wells and the duplicate blank wells should record PI values between + 25 % and - 25 %, and between + 95 % and + 105 %, respectively.
The diagnostic threshold (cut-off value) for test sera is 50 % (PI 50 %).
INDIRECT ELISA FOR THE DETECTION OF ANTIBODIES TO AFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS VIRUS (AHSV) (PRESCRIBED TEST) The test described hereinafter is in accordance with the test description in Chapter 2.1.11 of the OIE Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines, fourth edition, 2000.
Test procedure 2.1.1.
Solid phase 2.1.1.1.
ELISA plates are coated with recombinant AHSV-4 VP7 diluted in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9,6.
Incubate plates overnight at 4 °C. 2.1.1.2.
Wash the plates five times with distilled water containing 0,01 % (v/v) Tween 20 (washing solution).
Block the plates with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) + 5 % (w/v) skimmed milk (Nestlé Dry Skim MilkTM), 200 μl/well, for 1 hour at 37 °C. 2.1.1.4.
Serum samples to be tested, and positive and negative control sera, are diluted 1 in 25 in PBS + 5 % (w/v) skimmed milk + 0,05 % (v/v) Tween 20, 100 μl per well.
Incubate for 1 hour at 37 °C. 2.1.2.2.
Wash the plates as described in step 2.1.1.2. 2.1.3.
Conjugate 2.1.3.1.
Dispense 100 μl/well of horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated anti-horse gamma-globulin diluted in PBS + 5 % milk + 0,05 % Tween 20, pH 7,2.
Incubate for 1 hour at 37 °C. 2.1.3.2.
Wash the plates as described in step 2.1.1.2. 2.1.4.
Cromogen/Substrate 2.1.4.1.
Other chromogens such as ABTS (2,2'-Azino-bis-[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid]), TMB (tetramethyl benzidine), or OPD (ortho-phenyldiamine) can also be used. 2.1.4.2.
Read the plates at 600 nm (or 620 nm). 2.2.
Calculate the cut-off value by adding 0,6 to the value of the negative control (0,6 is the standard deviation derived with a group of 30 negative sera). 2.2.2.
The principal of the test is the interruption of the reaction between the recombinant VP7, as the antigen bound to the ELISA plate and the conjugated Mab specific for the VP7.
Test procedure 3.1.1.
ELISA plates 3.1.1.1.
Wash the plates five times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0,05 % (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST). 3.1.1.3.
Conjugate Add 50 μl/well of pre-diluted horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated Mab (monoclonal antibodies specific for VP7) to each well and mix gently to ensure homogeneity.
Incubate for 30 minutes at 37 °C. 3.1.4.
Chromogen/Substrate Add 100 μl/well of chromogen/substrate solution (1 ml of ABTS (2,2'-Azino-bis-[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid]) 5 mg/ml + 9 ml of substrate buffer (0,1 M Phosphate-Citrate buffer of pH 4 containing 0,03 % H2O2] and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Reading Read at 405 nm in an ELISA reader. 3.2.
Assay validation The test is valid when the optical density (OD) of negative control (NC) is higher than 1,0 and the OD of positive control (PC) is lower than 0,2. 3.2.2.
