PROCEDURE (1) By letters dated 16 December 2002, registered by the Commission on 18 December (A/39321), and 20 December 2002, registered on 31 December (A/39483), the Italian authorities notified, pursuant to Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty, an aid scheme planned by the Region of Piedmont for the extension of the network of service stations for the sale of natural gas used as motor fuel. (2) By letter D/50722 of 3 February 2003, the Commission requested additional information on the notified scheme. (3) The Italian authorities submitted additional information by letter of 25 March 2003, registered on 28 March (A/32278). (4) By letter SG(2003) D/229965 dated 28 May 2003, the Commission informed Italy that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the proposed measure. (5) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2].
Allocation to the Regional Transport Directorate of EUR 9009895,07 under heading 25192/2002%quot%. (9) The scheme concerns the extension of the network of service stations for the distribution of natural gas (methane) used as motor fuel.
Form of the measure (10) The proposed measure is provided in the form of a grant. 2.3.
Intensity, recipients and eligible costs (11) The grant amounts to EUR 150000 per service station.
Budget and duration (12) The budget amounts to around EUR 5 million.
The duration of the scheme is conditional on the budget allocation.
GROUNDS FOR INITIATING THE PROCEDURE (13) In its decision of 28 May 2003 (hereinafter the decision initiating the procedure), the Commission set out the doubts raised by the notified scheme with regard to a number of issues. 3.1.
Aid amount (14) The Commission pointed out that the aid amount exceeded the EUR 100000 maximum that may be granted over a period of three years to any one enterprise under Commission Regulation (EC) No 69/2001 of 12 January 2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to de minimis aid [3] and noted that the Italian authorities did not intend to reduce the planned grants of EUR 150000 per service station, on the ground that the said amount was the minimum incentive needed to spur investments in new service stations in the region. 3.2.
Ownership of the natural gas service stations and identity of the aid recipients (16) In its decision initiating the procedure, the Commission referred to a previous decision it had taken in a similar case: Decision 1999/705/EC of 20 July 1999 on the State aid implemented by the Netherlands for 633 Dutch service stations located near the German border [4].
That Decision was subsequently upheld by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 13 June 2002 [5]. 3.4.
Eligible costs (23) The Commission noted that the investment aid was not clearly linked to any eligible cost provided for by the Community guidelines on State aid for environmental protection [8], and in particular point 37 thereof.
Neither did the investment aid notified under the scheme in question correspond to any of the cases covered by points 29 (aid to improve on Community standards), 30 (energy saving), 31 (combined production of electric power and heat) or 32 (aid to promote renewable sources of energy) of the environmental aid guidelines [9]. 3.6.
COMMENTS FROM ITALY 4.1.
CO2, PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 were the main pollutants produced by this activity and natural gas was the best alternative to traditional fuels.
In this respect, natural gas could play an important role in attaining the objective of sustainable mobility. (28) The claimed impact on pollutant emissions of replacing vehicles (buses, trucks, vans, etc.) powered by traditional fuels with natural gas-driven vehicles was supported by statistical evidence provided by the Piedmont regional authorities. (29) The Commission itself had proposed that 20 % of petrol and diesel fuel used in the road transport sector be replaced by alternative fuels, and natural gas had been identified as one of the fuels that could contribute significantly to the attainment of that objective. 4.2.
Aid amount (30) In their comments, the Italian authorities took the view that EUR 150000 per service station was the minimum level of incentive needed to stimulate and promote such investments — both when the infrastructure is built as part of an entirely new station for the supply of natural gas as motor fuel and when it is limited to a new outlet (dispenser or pump, with the annexed infrastructure) built at an existing station.
The amount of EUR 150000 was based on an estimate of the minimum incentive in a sector where profitability under normal market conditions was deemed to be still low, due to long pay-back periods and very slim profit margins.
Net of the variable costs, the margin fell to EUR 0,040 per cubic metre (standard margin applied by the operator), which would be further reduced by the annual overheads (staff, maintenance and administrative costs), estimated at EUR 10000 per year. (32) In the example provided by the Italian authorities, natural gas accounted for only 2,51 % of the annual turnover of the service station. 4.3.
Such costs were entirely borne by the investor. (36) Although it is not necessary to analyse any further the investment costs indicated by the Italian authorities for installing an additional sales outlet for natural gas at an existing service station, since the assessment concludes that the proposed measure does not constitute State aid, the Commission considers that a maximum cost of EUR 300000 for installing a gas distribution outlet is acceptable, on the basis of market conditions in other Member States. 4.4.

Region | Methane outlets | Valle d’Aosta | 0 | Piedmont | 12 [11] | Liguria | 7 | Lombardy | 29 | Veneto | 68 | Friuli-Venezia Giulia | 4 | Trentino-Alto Adige | 3 | Emilia-Romagna | 81 | Marche | 44 | Abruzzo | 12 | Molise | 3 | Tuscany | 51 | Umbria | 16 | Lazio | 13 | Apulia | 20 | Campania | 19 | Basilicata | 3 | Calabria | 1 | Sicily | 6 | Sardinia | 0 | %quot%White outlets%quot% (independent outlets, not broken down by region): all fuels | [976] | Total for Italy | 392 | (40) Out of 1974 [12] outlets for the supply of motor fuels in Piedmont (down from 3753 in 1980), 14 are authorised also for the supply of methane, of which only 12 are operational and just six have been built in the past 25 years.
Asti, Biella, Verbania and Vercelli have none. (41) The planned budget for the scheme will allow only 33 new outlets to be built.
On the demand side, Piedmont has a total fleet of 5500 methane-fuelled vehicles (0,16 % of the total).
On the contrary, the anticipated growth in the number of natural gas-driven vehicles in Piedmont could be expected — through cross-border traffic flows — to result in increased sales of natural gas also by non-Italian service stations, located in France or other Member States. (43) In conclusion, the situation described above ruled out any negative cross-border impact of Piedmont’s natural gas service stations and merely suggested that the measure would have a localised — i.e.
Ownership of the natural gas service stations and identity of the aid recipients (nature of the agreement between the supplier and the dealer) (44) The fuel supply (distribution) sector was liberalised in 1998 [13]. (45) All operators meeting the subjective and objective — such as minimum performance and safety standards, environmental protection, etc. — requirements were eligible for authorisation.
Based on evidence provided by the Italian authorities, 65 % of all fuel distribution outlets in Piedmont belonged to oil companies whereas 35 % belonged to independents. (48) When the licensee was an oil company, the prevailing pattern — both in Piedmont and nationwide — was the company-owned/dealer-operated pattern (Co/Do), where the dealer rents the service station, operates it at his own risk and is linked to the supplier-licensee by either an exclusive purchasing agreement (somministrazione) or a loan for use (comodato petrolifero) [15].
The use of natural gas as motor fuel had triggered a major conversion effort by the main car manufacturers in Europe (Fiat, Opel, Volvo, Renault, VW, Ford and Mercedes) and was deeply affecting the commercial vehicle sector too.
The proposal for a Directive presented by the Commission on 7 November 2001 set a target share of the motor fuel market for natural gas of 10 % by 2020 [18].
ASSESSMENT 6.1.
Legality of the aid (56) The Italian authorities have fulfilled their obligation under Article 88(3) of the Treaty by notifying the scheme to the Commission before putting it into effect. 6.2.
Presence of aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty (57) Article 87(1) of the Treaty states that %quot%any aid granted by a Member State or through state resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, insofar as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market%quot%. (58) The scheme provides an advantage through state resources (grants of EUR 150000 from the budget of the Piedmont Region) to certain undertakings (the licensees, owners of the service stations).
Out of the 1974 service stations in the Piedmont Region, only 10 are company-owned/company-operated (Co/Co) and are therefore owned by oil companies.
The remaining 1964 service stations are dealer-owned/dealer-operated (Do/Do) (around 35 %) and company-owned/dealer-operated (Co/Do) (around 65 %).
If it is assumed that the 33 grants will be distributed in proportion to the share of existing Co/Cos, Do/Dos and Co/Dos, it is not possible for an oil company to receive more than one grant.
Article 2 This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Italy.
