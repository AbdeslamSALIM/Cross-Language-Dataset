Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides {COM(2006) 372 final} {SEC(2006) 894} {SEC(2006) 914} /* COM/2006/0373 final - COD 2006/0132 */ EN Brussels, 12.7.2006 COM(2006) 373 final 2006/0132 (COD) Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides (presented by the Commission) {COM(2006) 372 final} {SEC(2006) 894} {SEC(2006) 914} EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
Existing policies and legislation were first introduced at Community level in 1979 and have evolved considerably over the years, culminating in the adoption of Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and of Directive 98/8/EC concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market.
Pursuant to Article 7(2)(c) of Decision No 1600/2002/EC, the specific objectives of the Thematic Strategy are: – to minimise the hazards and risks to health and environment from the use of pesticides – to improve controls on the use and distribution of pesticides – to reduce the levels of harmful active substances including through substituting the most dangerous with safer (including non-chemical) alternatives – to encourage the use of low-input or pesticide-free crop farming, in particular by raising users' awareness, by promoting codes of good practices and consideration of the possible application of financial instruments – to establish a transparent system for reporting and monitoring the progress made towards the achievement of the objectives of the strategy, including the development of suitable indicators.
The attached draft Directive contains all measures for which new legislation was deemed necessary, with two exceptions: – the collection and reporting of statistics regarding placing on the market and use of plant protection products, for which the Commission will propose a separate Regulation, – the certification of pesticide application equipment placed on the market, for which the Commission will propose a separate Directive, which will possibly amend Directive 2006/42/EC of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC (recast) [1].
More than 150 contributions were received.
All contributions have been fully considered in the preparation of the various elements of the Thematic Strategy, including the attached Directive and the Impact Assessment.
The proposal therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle. · Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons.
The proposed Directive creates the legal framework with the essential requirements and objectives.
When necessary, the Commission will adopt amendments to the Annexes of the proposed Directive, following a regulatory committee procedure within the framework of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health established by Article 58 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.
Article 2 outlines the scope of the Directive.
Article 3 contains the definitions deemed necessary for the purposes of the Directive.
Article 5 requires Member States to set up systems of training for distributors and professional users of pesticides, in order to ensure full awareness about the risks involved.
Article 6 calls on Member States to ensure that at least one person in the employment of distributors selling toxic or very toxic pesticides is available to provide information to customers, and that only those professional users fulfilling the necessary requirements shall have access to pesticides.
Article 7 obliges Member States to facilitate and promote awareness programmes and availability of information to the public relating to pesticides and their alternatives, in order to inform non-professional users about all relevant risks and precautionary measures.
Article 9 obliges Member States to prohibit aerial spraying but allows for derogations.
Article 12 obliges Member States to adopt measures to address "point source" emissions, in particular from mixing, loading and cleaning.
Article 13 requests Member States to take the necessary measures in order to establish the conditions essential for implementation of Integrated Pest Management.
Article 14 states that Member States will be obliged to collect and report statistical information on placing on the market and use of pesticides-the details are proposed in the Regulation concerning statistics on plant protection products.
This information will be the basis for calculating appropriate risk indicators, which are necessary to monitor progress in the reduction of overall risks from the use of pesticides.
Article 15 requires the Commission to regularly report to the European Parliament and the Council, based on the reports provided by Member States on the measures that they adopt to achieve the objectives of this Framework Directive.
Articles 16 to 22 contain standard provisions regarding Comitology, standardisation, penalties and entry into force.
Annex I lists the elements that have to be addressed in the training programmes.
Annex II contains the essential requirements for the inspections and maintenance verifications to be carried out for application equipment in use. 2006/0132 (COD) Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission [4], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [5], Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions [6], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty, Whereas: (1) In line with Articles 2 and 7 of Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme [7], a common legal framework for achieving a sustainable use of pesticides should be established. (2) The measures provided for in this Directive should be complementary to and not affect measures laid down in other related Community legislation, in particular Regulation (EC) no […] on plant protection products [8], Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy [9]; Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and the Council 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC [10]. (3) National action plans aiming at setting objectives for the reduction of risks, including hazards, and dependency of pesticide use and at promoting non-chemical plant protection should be used by Member States in order to facilitate the implementation of this Directive.
The national action plans may be coordinated with implementation plans under other relevant Community legislation and could be used for grouping together objectives to be achieved under other Community legislation related to pesticides. (4) The exchange of information on the objectives and actions Member States lay down in their national action plans is a very important element for achieving the objectives of this Directive.
Training activities for professional users may be co-ordinated with those organised in the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) [12]. (7) Considering the possible risks from the use of pesticides, the general public should be better informed on risks related to the use of pesticides through awareness-raising campaigns, information passed on through retailers and other appropriate measures. (8) To the extent that the handling and application of pesticides requires the setting of minimum health and safety requirements at the workplace, covering the risks arising from exposure of workers to such products, as well as general and specific preventive measures to reduce those risks, those measures are covered by Council Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work [13] and Directive 2004/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the protection of workers from the risks related to their exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work [14]. (9) Since Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC (recast) [15] will provide for rules on the placing on the market of pesticide application equipment ensuring that environment requirements are met, it is appropriate, in order to further reduce the adverse impacts of pesticides on human health and the environment caused by such equipment, to provide for systems for regular technical inspection of pesticide application equipment already in use. (10) Aerial spraying of pesticides has the potential to cause significant adverse impacts on human health and the environment, in particular from spray drift.
In such areas, pesticide use should, therefore, be reduced as far as possible, or eliminated, if appropriate. (12) Use of pesticides can be particularly dangerous in very sensitive areas, such as Natura 2000 sites protected in accordance with Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds [16], and Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora [17].
Therefore, it is appropriate to provide for specific measures addressing those activities as a complement to the measures provided for under Articles 4 and 8 of Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste [18], and Articles 2 and 5 of Council Directive 91/689/EEC of 12 December 1991 on hazardous waste [19].
The penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. (17) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to protect human health and the environment from the possible risks associated with the use of pesticides, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, by reason of scale and effects of the action, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
In particular, this seeks to promote the integration into Community policies of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. (19) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [20].
