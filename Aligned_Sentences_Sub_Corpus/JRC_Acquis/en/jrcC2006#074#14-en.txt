Pleas in law and main arguments The Commission believes that Article 296 EC does not allow a Member State to exempt from customs duties imports of military matĂŠriel, in that the levying of those duties cannot be considered to threaten that Member State's essential security interests.
In the absence of concrete argument that might furnish specific justification of the need to derogate from the customs rules in order to protect the essential interests of the security of the Portuguese Republic, the Commission takes the view that the Portuguese authorities have failed to fulfil their obligations under Article 26 EC, Article 20 of the Community Customs Code [3] and, in consequence, the Common Customs Tariff.
The Portuguese authorities ought to have credited the customs duties in the accounting ledgers in accordance with the rules fixed by the Community Customs Code for the imports at issue, and also to have established and made available to the Commission the own resources so resulting pursuant to Articles 2, 9, 10 and 11 of Regulation No 1552/89 and the corresponding provisions of Regulation No 1150/2000.
