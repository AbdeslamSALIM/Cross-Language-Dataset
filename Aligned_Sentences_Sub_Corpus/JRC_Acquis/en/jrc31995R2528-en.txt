Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, the sucrose content, including other sugars expressed as sucrose, of products containing less than 85 % sucrose or other sugars expressed as sucrose, and invert sugar expressed as sucrose shall be determined by ascertaining the dry matter content.
The dry matter content shall be determined according to the specific gravity of the solution diluted in a proportion of 1 to 1 by weight and, for solid products, by drying.
The dry matter content shall be expressed as sucrose by multiplying by the coefficient 1.` 2.
