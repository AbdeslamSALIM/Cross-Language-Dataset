Those measures should therefore be adopted in accordance with the management procedure provided for in Article 4 of that Decision. (11) Complementarity and synergy with related Community initiatives and programmes should be ensured by the Commission, including, inter alia, by taking into account the work performed by other bodies. (12) This Decision lays down, for the entire duration of the Programme, a financial framework constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure [11], for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure. (13) Since the objectives of the proposed actions cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States due to the transnational character of the issues at stake and can, therefore, by reason of the European scope and effects of the actions be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
