Article 2 No Member State may refuse to grant EEC type-approval or national type-approval in respect of a vehicle, or refuse or prohibit the sale, registration, entry into service or use of a vehicle, on grounds relating to its fuel consumption if the consumption figures have been determined in accordance with Annexes I and II and are set out in a document given to the vehicle owner at the time of purchase in a manner and form decided on by each Member State.
Article 5 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Constant speed test at 90 km/h (see section 6); 3.1.3.
Constant speed test at 120 km/h (see section 6).
This test is not performed if the vehicle's maximum design speed is less than 130 km/h. 3.2.
The vehicle must have been run in and have covered at least 3 000 km before the test. 4.2.
The fuel must be supplied to the engine through a device capable of measuring the quantity consumed to within Â± 2 % ; this device must not interfere with normal supply.
The air density is calculated using the formula: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0013780%quot%%gt% dT = air density under test conditions; do = air density under reference conditions; HT = pressure during the test; TT = absolute temperature during the test (K). 5.
The test cycle is as described in Annex III to Directive 70/220/EEC 5.1.1.
Reference mass of the vehicle The mass of the vehicle is the reference mass, as defined in section 1.2 of Annex I to Directive 70/220/EEC 5.2.
The idling period between two consecutive cycles may be extended by not more than 60 s to facilitate fuel consumption measurement. 5.4.
If the fuel consumption is measured gravimetrically, the consumption is expressed (in litres/100 km) by converting the measurement M (fuel consumed expressed in kilograms) using the following formula: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0013781%quot%%gt% Sg = density of the fuel under the reference conditions (kg/dm3); D = distance covered during the test (km). 5.4.2.
If the extreme measurements differ by more than 5 % from the mean, further tests must be carried out in accordance with this procedure until a degree of accuracy of at least 5 % is obtained. 5.5.3.
For the purposes of this Directive, %quot%mass of the vehicle in running order%quot% means its total unladen mass with all tanks except the fuel tank full, the fuel tank being filled to 90 % of the capacity specified by the manufacturer, and with a set of tools and the spare wheel on board. 6.2.
The relative humidity must be less than 95 % ; the road must be dry ; the road surface may, however, bear traces of moisture, provided that there is no appreciable film of water at any one place. 6.3.1.1.2.
The average wind speed must be less than 3 m/s and gusts less than 8 m/s. 6.3.1.2.
A straight road may be used provided that a run of 2 km is made in both directions.
The gradient must not exceed 2 % between any two points. 6.3.1.4.
The average speed for each test must not differ from the reference speed by more than 2 km/h. 6.3.1.5.
If the conditions in 6.3.1.7 are not achieved for either pair of calculated values, the four test runs must be repeated.
