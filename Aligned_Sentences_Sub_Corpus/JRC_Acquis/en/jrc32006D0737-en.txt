2006/737/EC: Commission Decision of 20 October 2004 on aid from Germany for Westdeutsche Landesbank %mdash% Girozentrale (WestLB), now WestLB AG (notified under document number C(2004) 3925) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 20 October 2004 on aid from Germany for Westdeutsche Landesbank — Girozentrale (WestLB), now WestLB AG (notified under document number C(2004) 3925) (Only the German text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/737/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above [1] and having regard to their comments, Whereas: I.
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE (1) By a complaint dated 23 March 1993, the Bundesverband deutscher Banken e.V. ("BdB"), representing about 300 privately owned banks in Germany, urged the Commission to institute proceedings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty against Germany.
It claimed that the German Banking Supervisory Authority (Bundesaufsichtsamt für das Kreditwesen — "BAKred") had infringed Article 4(1) of Council Directive 89/299/EEC when accepting assets of the Wohnungsbauförderungsanstalt des Landes North Rhine-Westphalia ("Wfa"), which had been merged with Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale ("WestLB"), as own funds of the latter. (2) By letter dated 31 May 1994, BdB informed Directorate-General IV, responsible for competition, of the asset transfer, alleging a distortion of competition in favour of WestLB.
In February and March 1995 and in December 1996 ten individual banks associated themselves with the complaint of their association. (3) By letters dated 12 January, 9 February, 10 November and 13 December 1993 and 16 January 1996, the Commission asked the German authorities for further information in order to determine whether the asset transfer constituted state aid.
The German authorities replied by letters dated 9 February and 16 March 1993, 8 March 1994, 12 April and 26 April 1996 and 14 January 1997.
In it the Commission concluded that the measure in question probably constituted state aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty and that it needed additional information to carry out the necessary appraisal.
By letters of 22 September 1998, the Commission departments invited the German authorities, WestLB and BdB to a joint meeting on various aspects of the case.
The meeting with the three parties took place on 10 November 1998.
Following that meeting the Commission departments requested additional information and documents from the German authorities and from BdB by letters of 16 November 1998. (7) By letter dated 14 January 1999, BdB submitted the information requested after an extension of the deadline.
Germany complied with this injunction by letter dated 22 April 1999 after an extension of the deadline. (9) The Commission decided to arrange for an independent study to be carried out on the appropriate remuneration to be asked by the Land for the transfer of Wfa to WestLB.
Representatives of the consultancy charged with that task also attended the meeting with the three parties on 10 November 1998 and submitted the study to the Commission on 18 June 1999.
The Land informed WestLB by letter of 9 August 1999, which arrived the same day.
Firstly, the annulment was based on the reasons stated for the remuneration for liquid equity capital as the starting point for the calculation, for which the Commission had set a rate of 12 % per annum (after corporation tax and before investor taxes).
Secondly, it was based on the reasons stated for the top-up for this remuneration, for which the Commission had set a rate of 1,5 % per annum (after corporation tax and before investor taxes).
These points apart, the Court confirmed in full the Commission decision. 3.
RESUMED ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE (15) By letters of 20 and 29 January, 6 February and 28 May 2004, the Commission asked the German authorities for an update of the relevant information for this decision.
This was provided on 10 March and 14 June 2004 after an extension of the deadline and orally discussed on 28 July 2004.
By letter of 6 October 2004, Germany provided additional information that had been requested. (16) In July 2004 the complainant BdB, the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia and WestLB AG reached a preliminary understanding on the proper return that was submitted to the Commission on 19 July and that should, in their view, be used for the two points criticised by the Court.
The definitive version of this understanding was submitted to the Commission on 13 October 2004. (17) In the present new decision, the Commission has rectified in line with the Court's indications the two points criticised by it (justification for the basic remuneration and a possible top-up).
On 31 December 1991 its recognised own capital amounted to DEM 5,1 billion.
Irrespective of special provisions of the Land, WestLB was subject to banking supervision under the German Banking Law (Kreditwesengesetz). (19) WestLB was 100 % publicly owned.
The largest single stake in the nominal capital was held by the Land (43,2 %).
This ownership structure remained unchanged through the relevant period from 31 December 1991 to 1 August 2002. (20) As a public-law institution, WestLB benefited from two forms of guarantees from its public owners: "institutional liability" (Anstaltslast) and "guarantor liability" (Gewährträgerhaftung).
This guarantee does not create a liability on the part of the owners vis-à-vis the creditors of the bank but only governs the relationship between the public authorities and the bank.
However, savings banks had long since developed into all-purpose credit institutions.
Likewise, over the last few decades WestLB developed increasingly into an independent commercial bank and was a strong competitor on the German and European banking markets. (22) When measured by balance-sheet total, the WestLB group ranked among the five largest German credit institutions during the relevant period.
It also transacted a substantial part of its business activities outside Germany. (23) Furthermore, under special legal provisions, WestLB, unlike private banks but in the same way as other public credit institutions, was able, until it was split up in August 2002, to conduct mortgage banking and building and loan association business under one organisational roof along with its other operations.
WestLB AG took over the commercial activities of the former WestLB, while Landesbank Northrhein-Westfalen took over its public activities.
Wfa was incorporated into Landesbank Northrhein-Westfalen at the time of the split-up and therefore withdrawn from the commercial activities taken over by WestLB AG.
The rules of Landesbank Northrhein-Westfalen also stipulated that Wfa's capital cannot be used to underpin the mortgage bonds business remaining within the Landesbank and that, in future, a remuneration of 0,6 % per annum was to be paid to the Land in respect of a possible liability function. 2.
On account of its non-profit character, it was exempt from corporation tax (Körperschaftssteuer), property tax (Vermögenssteuer) and tax on business capital (Gewerbekapitalsteuer). (29) As a public-law institution, Wfa was covered by the Land's "institutional liability" (Anstaltslast) and "guarantor liability" (Gewährträgerhaftung) for all its liabilities.
CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE OWN FUNDS DIRECTIVE AND THE SOLVENCY RATIO DIRECTIVE (32) Under Council Directive 89/647/EEC on a solvency ratio for credit institutions [7] ("Solvency Ratio Directive") and under the Own Funds Directive, banks must have own funds equivalent to at least 8 % [8] of their risk-adjusted assets and risk-bearing off-balance-sheet transactions [9].
These Directives necessitated amendments to the German Banking Law which took effect on 1 January 1992.
The new requirements entered into force on 30 June 1993 [10].
Until that date German credit institutions were obliged to have own funds equivalent to 5,6 % of their risk-adjusted assets [11]. (33) As for the new threshold of at least 8 %, half of these own funds have to be "original own funds" (Basiseigenmittel), which consist of capital items available to a credit institution for unrestricted and immediate use to cover losses as soon as they occur.
Furthermore, a special provision in the German Banking Law (Section 12), not based on Community legislation but found in other Member States, limits the total amount of long-term investments, including holdings in non-financial enterprises, to the total amount of the bank's own funds. (36) German banks had to adapt to the new capital requirements by 30 June 1993.
According to test calculations made by Deutsche Bundesbank in December 1991 on the basis of the provisions of the Directives, the Landesbanks had an average solvency ratio of 6,3 %, compared with the 8 % required from 30 June 1993 [15].
In the case of WestLB, the Land decided to transfer Wfa to WestLB in order to strengthen the latter's own funds base.
THE TRANSFER AND ITS EFFECTS a) THE TRANSFER (38) On 18 December 1991 the Parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia passed the Law governing the promotion of housing (Gesetz zur Regelung der Wohnungsbauförderung) [17], Article 1 of which ordered the transfer of Wfa to WestLB.
The transfer became effective on 1 January 1992. (39) According to the grounds of the Law, the primary reason for the transfer was to increase WestLB's own funds in order to enable it to comply with the stricter capital requirements entering into force on 30 June 1993.
Combining the housing promotion activities of Wfa with those of WestLB was to have the secondary effect of increasing efficiency. (40) As part of the transfer, the Land waived Wfa's guarantee of about DEM 7400 million (EUR 3780 million) for liabilities of the Land in connection with funds raised for housing promotion (see Section II, point 2). (41) WestLB became the universal legal successor to Wfa (except for Wfa's liability vis-à-vis the Land for debts entered into by the Land for reasons of housing promotion, which was waived prior to the transfer).
It was clarified in the agreement that WestLB owners' "institutional liability" (Anstaltslast) also covered Wfa's special reserve.
It was also stated in the agreement that the increase in WestLB's equity base through the integration of Wfa constituted an act in money's worth (geldwerte Leistung) by the Land and that the annual remuneration for this act should be agreed on by the owners once the first financial results for the years from 1992 onwards were available [18].
This was done in a protocol note to the covering agreement dated 11 November 1993.
The transferred assets are fully and instantaneously available to WestLB to cover losses or, in the event of bankruptcy, to cover creditors' claims. (44) The management contract regarding the Law governing the promotion of housing (Geschäftsbesorgungsvertrag zum Wohnungsbauförderungsgesetz) concluded between the Land and WestLB lays down that WestLB will use the special reserve to underpin its own business activities only in so far as fulfilment of Wfa's legally binding tasks is guaranteed. (45) Although Wfa lost its legal independence by becoming a housing promotion division of WestLB and was integrated into WestLB's accounts, it was not integrated operationally into WestLB.
This new housing promotion division of WestLB is included in WestLB's accounts but also publishes separate ones.
Since the German authorities assumed that the integrated Wfa did indeed remain a non-profit-making entity, the tax exemptions mentioned in Section II, point 2 above were not abolished. (47) WestLB's competitors also opposed the merger of the monopoly-like Wfa and WestLB because they feared that WestLB would be able to take advantage of information gathered in the housing promotion field to acquire new customers for its commercial business.
The competent authorities have undertaken to ensure that distortions of competition are not caused by such proximity, in particular by separating the housing promotion division from the commercial divisions of WestLB in terms of personnel, information, etc [19]. (48) With the splitting up of WestLB on 1 August 2002 (with retroactive effect under the accounting rules to 1 January 2002) under a law of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia of 2 July 2002, Wfa was allocated to Landesbank Northrhein-Westfalen and thus withdrawn from the commercial activities grouped together in WestLB AG.
b) VALUE OF WFA (49) As at 31 December 1991, the nominal value of Wfa's capital transferred to WestLB was about DEM 24900 million (EUR 12730 million), of which nearly DEM 24700 million (EUR 12680 million) was accounted for by the Land Housing Promotion Fund.
It should be noted that this valuation was carried out only after the Land had decided on the transfer of Wfa. (51) As to the valuation method, the auditor stated that, because of the continuing obligation to reinvest all future income of Wfa in low-interest or non-interest-bearing housing promotion loans, the institution would in fact have no capitalised earnings value.
However, mainly because of the choice of a different discount rate and differing treatment of possible redemptions before maturity (Vorfälligkeitstilgungen), the valuation for BAKred arrived at a net asset value for Wfa ranging from DEM 4000 million (EUR 2050 million) to DEM 5400 million (EUR 2760 million). (54) On the basis of this valuation, BAKred finally accepted on 30 December 1992 DEM 4000 million (EUR 2050 million) as WestLB's original own funds within the meaning of the German Banking Law.
Neither the amount shown in WestLB's balance sheet — DEM 5900 million (EUR 3020 million) — nor the amount accepted as original own funds has been changed since then. (55) Both valuations of the assets transferred were based on the situation after the waiver of Wfa's liability vis-à-vis the Land, which they valued at around DEM 7300 million (EUR 3730 million).
c) EFFECTS OF WFA'S TRANSFER ON WESTLB (56) On 31 December 1991 WestLB had recognised own funds of DEM 5100 million (EUR 2600 million), of which DEM 500 million (EUR 260 million) in profit participation certificates (Genußrechte).
The bank's solvency ratio was around 6,1 % on the basis of the provisions of the German Banking Law before its adaptation to the Community Banking Directives, i.e. 0,5 percentage point above the minimum level stipulated by that Law. (57) As a result of the acceptance of Wfa's capital as own funds of WestLB by BAKred, WestLB's total own funds were boosted to DEM 9100 million (EUR 4650 million), an increase of 79 %.
Taking into account an allocation of DEM 100 million (EUR 50 million) to reserves from profits, WestLB's own funds amounted to DEM 9200 million (EUR 4700 million) at 31 December 1992.
This corresponded to a solvency ratio of 8,7 %, including Wfa's capital and risk-adjusted assets. (58) Table 1: Capital requirements and own funds of WestLB and Wfa (based on data provided by the German authorities) (DEM million) | (at 31 December) | 1991 | 1992 | | | | Risk-adjusted assets of WestLB (without Wfa) | 83000 | 91209 | Risk-adjusted assets of Wfa | 13497 | 14398 | Risk-adjusted assets of WestLB (with Wfa) [20] | | 105607 | | | | Required own funds of WestLB [21] (= a) | 4611 | 5867 | Required own funds of WestLB without Wfa [21] (= b) | | 5067 | | | | WestLB own funds (= c) | 5090 | 9190 | WestLB own funds without Wfa (= d) | | 5190 | | | | Utilisation rate of WestLB own funds (= a/c) | 91 % | 64 % | Utilisation rate of WestLB own funds without Wfa (= b/d) | | 98 % | (59) This solvency ratio of 8,7 % included an increase in WestLB's risk-adjusted assets unrelated to housing promotion of some DEM 8200 million (EUR 4190 million), or 9,9 %, in 1992.
One year later, after the Wfa's capital had been accepted by BAKred, the ratio was about 8,1 %, including Wfa's risk-adjusted assets.
The ratio of 9 % was achieved by raising more additional own funds in the form of subordinated loans amounting to some DEM 2900 million (EUR 1480 million) in early 1993.
The solvency ratios had fallen slightly by the end of 1993, compared with 30 June. (63) Table 2: Capital requirements and own funds of the WestLB group (based on data provided by the German authorities) (DEM million) | Average amounts | 1992 [23] | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 [24] | | | | | | | | | | | | | Total assets | 271707 | 332616 | 378573 | 428622 | 470789 | 603797 | 693026 | 750558 | 782410 | 844743 | 519470 | Risk-adjusted assets | 126071 | 120658 | 151482 | 156470 | 173858 | 204157 | 259237 | [...] [22] | [...] | [...] | [...] | | | | | | | | | | | | | Required original own funds (= a) | 4758 | 4827 | 6060 | 6259 | 6954 | 8167 | 10370 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Required total own funds (= b) | 9351 | 9653 | 12119 | 12517 | 13908 | 16333 | 20739 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | | | | | | | | | | | | | Original own funds (= c) | 5117 | 8818 | 9502 | 9769 | 9805 | 10358 | 11378 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Additional own funds | 500 | 2495 | 4513 | 4946 | 5270 | 7094 | 10170 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Total own funds (= d) | 5617 | 11313 | 14015 | 14715 | 15075 | 17452 | 21548 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | | | | | | | | | | | | | Utilisation rate of original own funds (= a/c) | 93 % | 55 % | 64 % | 64 % | 71 % | 79 % | 91 % | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Utilisation rate of total own funds (= b/d) | 166 % | 85 % | 86 % | 85 % | 92 % | 94 % | 96 % | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | (64) In absolute figures, the original own funds of DEM 4000 million (EUR 2050 million) increased by DEM 72000 million (EUR 36800 million) the theoretical capacity to extend business volume with 100 % risk-adjusted assets under the former German Banking Law (5,6 % minimum solvency ratio).
On the basis of the minimum solvency ratio of 8 %, applicable since 30 June 1993, the relevant figure would be DEM 50000 million (EUR 25600 million).
Assuming that DEM 2500 million (EUR 1280 million) of Wfa's capital was available to the WestLB group's competitive business its 100 % risk-adjusted lending capacity was increased by DEM 31300 million (EUR 16000 million). (65) However, since a bank's assets are normally not 100 % risk-adjusted, the actual credit volume capacity was increased by a greater amount.
The 15 % threshold stipulated for large loans, which in total may not be higher than eight times the bank's own funds, was equivalent to about DEM 760 million (EUR 390 million) at 31 March 1992.
d) REMUNERATION FOR THE TRANSFER OF WFA (68) The transfer of Wfa did not lead to a change in the ownership structure of WestLB.
Therefore, the Land is not remunerated for the capital provided, either by way of a higher share in dividends paid or by way of a higher share in the capital gains of the holdings in WestLB. (69) The agreement governing the relationship between the owners of WestLB (Mantelvertrag) was amended on the transfer of Wfa.
The remuneration is paid only on the part of this capital not needed by Wfa to underpin its housing promotion activities.
This part, available for WestLB to underpin its commercial business, amounted to DEM 2500 million (EUR 1280 million) after the new capital requirements entered into force and has been increasing since then [28].

a) Appropriate remuneration for the capital (75) BdB argued that, like any other original own funds, the recognised original own funds of DEM 4000 million (EUR 2050 million) can be used to underpin business and, at the same time, to raise additional own funds for solvency reasons.
i) Level of the remuneration (76) BdB stressed that WestLB was in urgent need of original own funds and that the transfer of Wfa nearly doubled WestLB's original own funds from DEM 4700 million (EUR 2400 million) to DEM 8700 million (EUR 4450 million).
In return for providing capital under such conditions, a private investor would have demanded a premium of at least 0,5 percentage point on top of the normal return on equity capital.
BdB quoted WestLB's profitability as an average of 5,6 % before tax for the ten years prior to the transfer.
This compared with profitability figures for large private German banks of between 12,4 % and 18,6 %, with an average of 16,8 % (before tax) for the same period.
Other Landesbanks are said to have generated profits of between 9 % and 11 %.
The risk-free basic rate used is the same as in WestLB's calculation.
Considering the various methods of calculating return on equity, BdB finally quoted a range of 14 % to 16 % as a normal return on equity. (80) BdB further stated that a private minority shareholder would not inject additional capital without requesting an increase of his share in the company.
Only with such an increase could he duly participate in the profit of, and exercise greater influence on, the company. (81) BdB also stressed that the agreement between WestLB's shareholders whereby Wfa's capital should be subordinate in its liability only to the other equity of WestLB had, in fact, no real effect because the Land, by virtue of its institutional liability (Anstaltslast), had to step in if WestLB were in difficulties.
Thus, the risk profile of Wfa is no different from that of normal equity. (82) As regards the comparison with equity instruments on the financial market submitted by Germany and WestLB, BdB stressed that profit participation certificates (Genußrechte) and cumulative perpetual stocks could not be compared to Wfa's capital.
Secondly, the instruments referred to were limited in time and profit participation certificates lost their additional own funds character two years before maturity.
In return for accepting such a lack of trading possibilities, a private investor would demand a premium of at least 0,5 percentage point on his normal return. (83) BdB also provided the Commission with data on the equity components and solvency ratios of some large German private banks from 1990 onwards.
It also transpires from that information that these credit institutions generally had solvency ratios well above the minimum requirements of 4 % for original own funds and 8 % for total own funds. (84) BdB also commented on the covering agreement between the shareholders of WestLB, which stipulated that, internally, Wfa's capital was subordinate in its liability only to the other liable equity capital.
Therefore, the risk profile of Wfa's special reserve was therefore said to be higher than that of profit participation certificates and subordinated loans. (85) For all these reasons, BdB assumed that the remuneration of 0,6 % paid by WestLB did not constitute a market rate.
Taking into account WestLB's need to raise liquid funds in order to use Wfa's capital in full and the lack of participation in the accumulated reserves because the Land's share in WestLB did not increase, BdB suggested a rate within the range of 14 % to 17 % as correct remuneration.
This rate was to be paid on the total accepted amount of DEM 4000 million (EUR 2050 million).
On the basis of an analysis of the average market rates in the different years for the various refinancing instruments and in accordance with WestLB's balance-sheet structure, the actual rate for WestLB's refinancing on the markets was said to be an average of between 6,07 % and 6,54 % for the years 1992-96.
BdB also provided the Commission with figures for the refinancing costs of some large German private banks at the time of the transfer, which were considerably lower than the 7,5 % claimed by WestLB as appropriate refinancing costs at an earlier stage of the procedure.
iii) Capital basis for the calculation of the remuneration (89) As already mentioned, BdB suggested that the appropriate remuneration should be paid on the total accepted amount of DEM 4000 million (EUR 2050 million).
This amount therefore increased WestLB's credit standing, and a remuneration comparable to a guarantee premium should be paid for it.
b) Tax aspects (92) BdB pointed out that Wfa remained exempt from property tax, tax on business capital and corporation tax even after the transfer.
Tax exemptions for public-law credit institutions were justified only as long as these institutions were engaged exclusively in promotional activities and thus did not operate in competition with private taxable institutions. (93) According to BdB, a normal bank increasing its capital would each year have to pay on this additional capital 0,6 % property tax and 0,8 % tax on business capital.
The waiver of tax income constituted state aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty.
The waiver was also a decisive prerequisite for the acceptance by BAKred of DEM 4000 million (EUR 2050 million) of capital.
Observations from other interested parties (95) Besides WestLB and BdB, two other interested parties commented on the Commission decision to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty.
As it benefits from guarantor liability, WestLB has a triple-A rating which allows it to refinance on the markets on very favourable terms. (97) These advantages place French banks operating in Germany at a disadvantage.
Observations from WestLB (99) Following publication of the Commission decision to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty, WestLB submitted as its position a copy of Germany's observations on the same question and declared itself fully in agreement with that statement.
It is claimed that there is no basis in case law for applying the principle to sound and profitable enterprises. (101) WestLB submits that, given Wfa's special purpose, its assets are not comparable to normal funds.
In support of this opinion, WestLB submitted a report from an investment bank which had been commissioned by WestLB to assess the remuneration.
BdB included in its calculations investment periods which were not relevant for an investment decision in 1992 and, because it took into account all possible holding periods, it counted individual years several times over.
According to WestLB, the average return on equity of 16,6 % presented by BdB falls to 5,8 % after adjustment for all these factors.
c) Synergy effects (106) According to WestLB, the integration of Wfa into WestLB led to considerable cost savings for Wfa.
d) Tax exemptions (108) According to WestLB, the exemption of Wfa from certain taxes is in line with the system of German tax law, under which the taxes in question do not apply to institutions that serve public purposes and do not compete with other, tax-paying institutions.
e) WAIVER OF LIABILITY (109) As WestLB points out, the waiver of the liabilities in question was made before the transfer and subsequent valuation of Wfa's assets.
The Land of North Rhine-Westphalia received an appropriate remuneration which corresponded to the terms of the market.
Nor did the transaction constitute state aid for the other shareholders of WestLB as the preservation of the shareholder structure after Wfa's transfer was justified by the appropriate remuneration paid by WestLB.
Furthermore, the tax exemptions for Wfa do not include elements of state aid for WestLB because they did not affect the commercial business of the bank. (111) In Germany's opinion, the Commission may examine the case only on the basis of the circumstances obtaining at the time of the investment, i.e.
Within WestLB, a special housing promotion department was set up, with the costs being borne by Wfa.
It cannot be inferred from the case law that the Commission may examine state investments in sound and profitable public enterprises in order to determine whether they generate at least an average return.
The limit for the State is reached only when such behaviour can no longer be economically justified by the private-investor test. (118) However, the transaction can also be justified on the basis of the market-economy investor principle as a measure which would also have been taken by a private owner.
a foundation), the private owner of such an entity would have acted in the same way in order to put the assets, which cannot be used for any other purpose, to a commercial use. (119) According to Germany, the public purpose of Wfa's assets constitutes a task of general economic interest which, under Article 295 of the EC Treaty, is not subject to Commission supervision.
APPROPRIATE REMUNERATION FOR THE CAPITAL (122) Germany submitted that WestLB paid an appropriate remuneration for the transferred assets.
Since it was not yet clear in 1991 what amount would be accepted by BAKred as original own funds, a remuneration was fixed only in principle, but not in detail, at the time of the transfer.
The actual level of 0,6 % was fixed in 1993 after negotiations with the other owners of WestLB [31].
If, owing to a lack of profits, the remuneration was not paid in any one year, there was no right to recovery payments in future years [32].
The figure of 0,6 % corresponds to pre-tax costs of about 1,1 % for WestLB. (123) The following table shows the payments made by WestLB to the Land as remuneration for the capital transferred: (124) Table 4: Remuneration paid by WestLB for the transfer of Wfa (data provided by Germany) (DEM million) | | 1992 | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | | | | | | | | | | | | | Remuneration (before tax) | 0,0 | 27,9 | 30,8 | 33,4 | 33,9 | 34,0 | 34,0 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Payment for pension entitlement of Wfa staff | 33,1 | 0,0 | 0,0 | 0,0 | 0,0 | 0,0 | 0,0 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | | | | | | | | | | | | | Total remuneration paid to the Land | 33,1 | 27,9 | 30,8 | 33,4 | 33,9 | 34,0 | 34,0 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | (125) Germany presented studies by an external consultancy that had been commissioned by WestLB to assess what would have been an adequate remuneration in 1991 for a capital investment with the same risk profile as Wfa's assets.
The studies describe various features [33] of several equity capital instruments on the market (ordinary shares, dormant holdings, profit participation certificates, perpetual preferred shares, trust preferred securities and subordinated bonds) and compare them to Wfa's capital.
According to the studies, Wfa's capital can best be compared to profit participating certificates, perpetual preferred stock and dormant holdings [34].
According to the studies, at the end of 1991 the following capital instruments qualifying as original own funds were available in Germany: ordinary shares, preferred shares (Vorzugsaktien) and dormant holdings (Stille Beteiligungen). (127) The studies stress that Wfa's assets would be available for WestLB's creditors in the event of WestLB's bankruptcy (liability function — Haftungsfunktion).
At the same time, WestLB can offset losses without limitations against Wfa's special reserve (loss compensation function — Verlustausgleichsfunktion).
The same applies to dormant holdings. (129) As regards the liability function, the special reserve would be used after the other original own funds but before dormant holdings, profit participation certificates and other additional own funds.
Wfa's special reserve is therefore said to present a higher level of risk than profit participation certificates and dormant holdings.
Therefore, as regards interest payments, the risk attaching to Wfa's capital is slightly lower then that attaching to the other three instruments. (131) The studies conclude that the risk premium for Wfa's special reserve should be below that for profit participation certificates and dormant holdings as well as below that for perpetual preferred shares.
A historical margin before tax of between 1,0 % and 1,2 % is quoted for profit participation certificates, one of between 1,1 % and 1,5 % for dormant holidays and one of between 1,5 % and 2,0 % for perpetual preferred shares [35].
For Wfa's special reserve a remuneration of 1,1 % is calculated for the years 1993 to 1996 [36].
The studies conclude that the remuneration paid by WestLB was too high in 1992 and appropriate for the years 1993 to 1996.
The actual average refinancing costs of WestLB in November 1991 stood at 9,28 %.
Furthermore, the way in which synergies are achieved falls within the economic freedom of the Land, as protected by Article 295 of the EC Treaty. (139) Germany points out that in 1992 WestLB paid DEM 33 million (EUR 17 million) to cover existing and future pension entitlements of Wfa employees, which reduced the future costs of Wfa.
TAX EXEMPTIONS (140) The exemption of Wfa from property tax (Vermögenssteuer), tax on business capital (Gewerbekapitalsteuer) and corporation tax (Körperschaftssteuer) is provided for in the German tax system.
In fact, the Land is only waiving a liability against itself. (143) The waiver was taken into account in the valuation of Wfa's equity capital by BAKred and, on this basis, WestLB was paying an adequate remuneration.
The waiver therefore produces no financial benefit for WestLB. 5.
An investor is guided by prospects rather than sectoral averages. (146) The state aid rules allowed an examination only of the terms of the asset transfer, not of the particularities of Wfa's assets, which are protected by Article 295 of the EC Treaty.
A private-law foundation could be used in the same way as Wfa without any effect on the use of its revenues for its special purpose. (147) Regarding the risk profile of Wfa's capital, a distinction must be drawn between the role of the Land as an owner of WestLB and as an investor in Wfa's special reserve.
After adjustment for these errors, the return of 16,86 % before tax for large private banks in Germany comes down to 7,0 %.
They led to a reduction in the capital grants by the Land to Wfa and were the direct result of the transfer of Wfa to WestLB. (151) The difference between Wfa's special reserve shown in the balance sheet and the amount accepted by BAKred was clearly communicated to third parties.
The parties asked the Commission to take account of this understanding in its decision. (154) Applying the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), the parties first determined the minimum expected remuneration for a hypothetical own-capital investment in WestLB at the relevant transfer date.
Assessment of the measure (161) The first step in appraising the measure under the state aid rules of the EC Treaty is to assess whether it constitutes state aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty. 1.
Wfa's main source of financing, the Land Housing Promotion Fund, had been created by annual cash injections from the Land budget and by interest income from housing loans. (163) If state assets of this kind, which have a commercial value, are transferred to an enterprise without sufficient remuneration being paid, it is clear that state resources within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty are involved. (164) In order to verify whether the transfer of state resources to a public enterprise favours the latter and is therefore liable to constitute state aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty, the Commission applies the market-economy investor principle.
This principle has been accepted (and developed) by the Court in a number of decisions.
According to the 1997 annual report, the bank's growth in that year can be attributed mainly to the expansion of its foreign business. (168) These facts clearly show that WestLB offers its banking services in competition with other European banks outside Germany and, since banks from other European countries are active in Germany, inside Germany.
This principle has been applied by the Commission in many cases and has been accepted and developed by the Court in several decisions [38].
The market-economy investor principle will also be applied in the case at hand. (171) According to the principle, no state aid is involved if funds are made available on "terms which a private investor would find acceptable in providing funds to a comparable private undertaking when the private investor is operating under normal market economy conditions" [39].
In particular, a financial measure must be considered unacceptable to a market-economy investor if the financial position of the company is such that a normal return (in the form of dividends and capital gains) cannot be expected within a reasonable period of time [40]. (172) The Commission has, of course, to base its appraisal of a case on the data available to the investor at the time he took his decision on the financial measure in question.
The transfer of Wfa was decided in 1991 by the relevant public bodies.
However, at the time of the transfer, although the value of Wfa agreed on by the Land and WestLB was DEM 5900 million (EUR 3020 million), no level of remuneration was fixed.
Thus, in a communication to the Member States on the application of the state aid rules to public undertakings, the Commission stated that, when comparing the actions of the State with those of a market-economy investor, "in particular when a company is not making a loss", it would evaluate the financial situation of the company at the time an additional capital injection is proposed [41]. (178) It should also be borne in mind that "sound and profitable firms" cannot be equated with firms which do not make a loss.
Otherwise, the company will not be able to find the necessary funds and will therefore not be viable in the long run. (181) According to WestLB, the question of whether the bank generated average profits in the years before the transfer can, in principle, remain unanswered if a fixed and appropriate remuneration is agreed and if profitability is sufficient to maintain this remuneration in the long run.
Such step would directly reduce the bank's volume of business and hence its market presence. (183) If a public shareholder decides that a capital injection is an appropriate way for the bank to meet the capital requirements, the question is whether the particular circumstances under which the capital is provided would be acceptable for a market-economy investor.
It is likely that a market-economy investor would expect a higher return on a capital investment in a bank whose capital resources are depleted and which is in urgent need of new capital because this circumstance exposes him to higher risk. (184) In the light of the market-economy investor principle, the key question is whether such an investor would have supplied WestLB with capital that had the specific characteristics of Wfa's assets and under the same conditions, especially in view of the probable return on the investment.
a) ARTICLE 295 OF THE EC TREATY (185) Germany argues that the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia was not obliged to consider privatising WestLB in order to increase the latter's equity, that the Land was, in principle, free to transfer Wfa to WestLB in order to achieve synergies and that the Land was not obliged under Community law to consider the transfer of Wfa to a private credit institution.
Germany also claims that Wfa's public remit constitutes a task of general economic interest and that Wfa is, therefore, not subject to supervision by the Commission under Article 295. (186) As long as public entities carry out only public tasks and do not compete with commercial enterprises, the competition rules do not apply to them.
On the other hand, Article 295 of the EC Treaty protects the national systems of property ownership but this cannot justify any infringement of the Treaty's competition rules. (187) The German authorities and WestLB claim that, because of the constraints imposed by the special purpose assigned to Wfa's assets, as laid down by the Housing Promotion Law, the only possible profitable use of these resources was to transfer them to a similar public-law entity.
c) No change in ownership structure (191) When injecting equity capital into a bank, a market-economy investor demands an appropriate share in the bank's profits.
BdB claims that the whole amount of DEM 5900 million (EUR 3020 million) is at risk and therefore a remuneration should be paid on that amount.
The level of this remuneration should be different for the accepted original own funds of DEM 4000 million (EUR 2050 million) and the remaining amount of DEM 1900 million (EUR 970 million). (195) The Commission's consultants based their assessment on the assumption that, at the time of the transfer, the value of Wfa was established by the Land and WestLB at DEM 5900 million (EUR 3020 million) and that a market-economy investor would therefore, in principle, seek a remuneration in respect of that figure, regardless of any later developments such as the acceptance of the capital (or only part of it) as original own funds by BAKred.
However, the Commission's consultants also accept that the transaction would have taken a different course if normal commercial practice had been followed. (196) In the Commission's view, the sequence of steps in which the transfer was carried out could, in fact, point to an equal remuneration for the whole capital shown in WestLB's balance sheet.
However, under normal market conditions no bank would have agreed to include Wfa in its balance sheet for the sum of DEM 5900 million (EUR 3020 million) and to pay a uniform remuneration on that amount before first checking whether that amount would also be accepted as original own funds by the supervisory authority.
Therefore, the amount shown in WestLB's balance sheet but not usable by WestLB to expand its commercial business totals DEM 3400 million (EUR 1740 million). (198) However, equity is necessary not only for supervisory reasons.
Accepted own funds form only part of such an analysis of the bank's credit standing.
The amount of DEM 5900 million (EUR 3020 million) has been established by the Land and WestLB as a probable value which could be achieved in the event of Wfa being sold to a third party.
It should be borne in mind that the valuation made for BAKred also gives a spread of between DEM 4000 million (EUR 2050 million) and DEM 5400 million (EUR 2760 million).
This positive effect of the transfer on the bank's creditworthiness was also stated in the valuation of Wfa made for WestLB in 1992.
Since the amount of DEM 3400 million (EUR 1740 million) cannot be used to expand business but improves the bank's appearance in the eyes of creditors, its economic function may be compared in that respect to at least that of a guarantee, even if shown as equity in the balance sheet. (199) Since, therefore, the amount of DEM 3400 million (EUR 1740 million) is also of economic use to WestLB, a market-economy investor would have asked for a remuneration to be paid on it.
Certainly, the level of this remuneration will be lower than that for the DEM 2500 million (EUR 1280 million), which is of greater use to WestLB since it can also be used under the solvency rules as own funds to expand its commercial business.
e) Appropriate remuneration for the capital (200) Investments of differing economic quality require differing returns.
In analysing an investment's acceptability to an investor acting under normal market conditions, it is important therefore to bear in mind the special economic nature of the financial measure in question and the value of the capital provided for WestLB. (201) The complainant originally claimed that the transaction at issue constituted a state guarantee by the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia for WestLB's debt.
But WestLB shows the assets transferred as equity capital in their accounts and BAKred accepted an amount of DEM 4000 million (EUR 2050 million) as original own funds within the meaning of the Own Funds Directive, of which DEM 2500 million (EUR 1280 million) can be used by WestLB to underpin its commercial business.
The very same financial measure cannot be regarded as a capital injection under banking supervisory rules and as a guarantee under the EC Treaty's state aid rules.
i) Comparison with other equity instruments (202) Germany claims that, since no direct comparison with other transactions is possible, the appropriate remuneration for the capital provided should be established by comparing the transfer with various equity instruments on the markets.
To this end, it submitted outside studies the findings of which are given above and which conclude that Wfa's capital can best be likened to profit participation certificates, perpetual preferred stock and dormant holdings. (203) In the Commission's opinion, it is, in fact, difficult to liken Wfa's transfer to any instrument available on the market at that time because of its special nature.
Furthermore, the studies submitted by Germany are not really comprehensive because they leave out several relevant instruments such as non-voting shares. (204) It should be borne in mind that the instruments used for the comparison by Germany normally provide a bank with only a very limited part of own funds.
Hybrid instruments were usually issued up to a maximum of 20 %.
It would not have been possible to increase WestLB's capital in the same way — and on a permanent basis — by one of the instruments compared [43]. (205) It should also be noted that rating agencies pressed for some sort of "voluntary restriction" to be applied regarding the share of equity from hybrid instruments, which they monitored closely. (206) In this connection, it should be stressed that the relatively wide range of hybrid equity instruments now available to credit institutions in several countries for use as original own funds and additional own funds did not exist in Germany back in 1991, when the transfer of Wfa was decided, or in 1993, when WestLB had to comply with new, stricter capital requirements.
Germany itself also (indirectly) rejects such a comparison, claiming that the Commission must examine the case on the basis of the facts available at the time of the decision at the end of 1991. (207) Germany's studies claim that, in the case of WestLB, the likelihood of bankruptcy is so low that it could, in fact, be practically disregarded.
This certainly does not correspond to market reality.
Profit participation certificates constitute only additional own funds, whereas Wfa's capital qualifies as original own funds.
ii) Liquidity costs (211) The arguments of Germany and WestLB on the liquidity costs can, in principle, be accepted.
iii) Appropriate remuneration for the amount of DEM 2500 million (EUR 1280 million) (213) There are no doubt different ways of calculating the appropriate remuneration for the amount of DEM 2500 million made available.
Taking these basic principles, the Commission here carries out the calculation in two stages: first, it determines the minimum remuneration that an investor would expect for a (hypothetical) investment in WestLB's capital.
The arithmetic average of the historical capital costs is then compared with the future expected equity capital costs and thus with the investor's requirement as to the expected return. - Financing approach with the compound annual growth rate: At the heart of this approach stands the use of the geometric rather than the arithmetic mean value (compound annual growth rate). - Capital asset pricing model (CAPM): The CAPM is the best-known and most frequently tested model of modern financial economics, by which the return expected by an investor can be determined using the following formula: minimum return on capital = risk-free basic rate + (market risk premium × beta) The risk premium for the equity investment is obtained by multiplying the risk premium on the market by the beta factor (market risk premium × beta).
The CAPM can be used therefore only on the basis of an estimation of the beta factor. (219) The Commission possesses six expert reports in which the risk premium and the minimum return on capital were calculated using different approaches, with all of them calculating the risk premium for the transfer of Wfa's capital to WestLB not directly but on the basis of a (hypothetical) investment in WestLB's capital. - Ernst%amp%Young studies of 11 September 1995 and 28 August 1997: In the Ernst%amp%Young studies (1995), which apply the financing approach, the actual capital costs stemming from changes in last-trading-day prices (gains and losses) and dividends paid (dividend returns) are determined for the period 1982-92.
The arithmetic average of the historical capital costs is then compared to the investor's requirement as to the expected return. - The study by Associés en Finance (October 1999), which had been commissioned by BdB, arrived on the basis of the Securities Market Line Model at a minimum return of 10 %-11 % for an investment akin to a share capital investment in WestLB at the relevant time. - BdB study of 14 January 1999: In line with the financing approach, BdB determined, using the compound annual growth rate and the data pool of Ernst%amp%Young, the geometric mean values of the capital costs of the four leading German commercial banks (Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Commerzbank and Bayerische Vereinsbank) for all conceivable investment periods between 1982 and 1992.
The average capital costs of these banks (12,54 %) correspond to the investor's expected return. - Lehman Brothers study of 8 July 1997 commissioned by WestLB, expert opinion of Professor Schulte-Mattler of 14 January 1999 commissioned by BdB, and First Consulting study of 18 June 1999 carried out on behalf of the Commission: These consultants, who all apply the CAPM, first determined a general market-risk premium for the German share market at the end of 1991.
They arrived on average at a premium of 4 %-5 % (Lehman Brothers 4 %, Professor Schulte-Mattler 5 % and First Consulting 4 %-5 %).
In their understanding submitted to the Commission on 13 October 2004, the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia, WestLB and the complainant BdB took as the basis a market-risk premium of 4 %.
Professor Schulte-Mattler determined, using Deutsche Bundesbank data, a beta factor for commercial banks in Germany at the end of 1991 of 1,25 (on the basis of annual data) and of 1,1 (on the basis of monthly data).
By contrast, the consultant commissioned by WestLB, Lehman Brothers, took as a basis the betas not of all German credit institutions but of IKB Deutsche Industriebank and BHF-Bank, which was 0,765.
Lehman Brothers thus arrived at altogether lower risk premium for WestLB.
The complainant too accepted in the understanding submitted on 13 October 2004 a beta value of 0,76 as still appropriate and thus arrived at a minimum remuneration of 10,19 %, which differed from the figure given in its statement of 14 January 1999. (220) The following table summarises the findings of these studies.
If the methods mentioned above for deriving the expected return on a risky investment are applied, the following minimum returns on an investment in the share capital of WestLB are obtained: +++++ TIFF +++++ (221) The studies and opinions submitted come to the conclusion that a minimum return for a (hypothetical) investment in the share capital of WestLB at the relevant time ranges from 10 % to 13 % [47].
In the discussions between the complainant BdB, the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia and WestLB in July 2004, the parties agreed on a rate of 10,19 % as the appropriate remuneration.
As a result, the Commission determines a rate of 10,19 % per annum (after corporation tax and before investor tax) as the appropriate minimum remuneration for the transfer of Wfa's capital.
Return discount on account of lack of liquidity (222) During the proceedings, WestLB first claimed that its refinancing costs on the basis of its financial structure at the time of the transfer were 9,2 %.
In the understanding, the parties agreed, on the basis of the long-term risk-free basic interest rate at 31 December 1991 determined by them, to use a rate of 7,15 %.
Accordingly, the parties arrived at a net refinancing rate of 3,57 % for the part of Wfa's capital available to underpin commercial business, resulting in a liquidity discount. (223) Since the figures mentioned are still within the range indicated by Germany, the Commission does not see any grounds for not regarding them as appropriate and therefore bases its calculation of the aid element on them.
The index series used contains the year-end value of the REX 10 Performance Index as of 1970.
The parties have then determined the per annum return reflecting the trend as it is depicted in the period 1970-91 and, in this way, arrived at the aforementioned risk-free basic interest rates of 7,15 % ( 31 December 1991). (224) Since the investment in WestLB was indeed to be made available on a permanent basis, it seems fitting in this special case to apply this method of determining the risk-free basic interest rates.
The risk-free basic interest rates determined thus seem appropriate. (225) The Commission has therefore decided in this case to take as a basis the long-term, risk-free interest rate of 7,15 % at 31 December 1991 determined by the parties as the minimum gross refinancing costs.
Assuming an overall tax rate of 50 % [49] at the time of the investment, it arrives at a net refinancing rate and thus at a liquidity discount of 3,75 % per annum for Wfa's capital that was available for underpinning commercial business.
It must therefore be examined whether the particularities, and especially the specific risk profile of the transfer of Wfa's capital, constitute grounds for adjusting the minimum remuneration of 10,19 % — determined above — which a private investor would expect for a (hypothetical) investment in the capital of WestLB and whether the Commission can produce a methodically robust quantification of that adjustment.
If the Land's voting rights had been increased, it would have possessed more than 70 % of those rights, moving from being a minority (with 42 % of shares) to a majority shareholder.
It could be argued that the fact that the Land receives a fixed remuneration instead of one directly linked to WestLB's performance constitutes an advantage which justifies a reduction in the rate of the remuneration.
However, in the Commission's view, the way the remuneration was fixed and the considerations that played a part in that respect can certainly provide pointers to the extent to which the Land behaved like a market-economy investor. (233) Furthermore, it was agreed between the shareholders of WestLB that the remuneration should be fixed once WestLB's financial results for 1992 onwards were available.
Total remuneration (235) On the basis of the above considerations and in agreement with the complainant BdB, the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia and WestLB, the Commission considers that an appropriate remuneration for the investment in question would be 6,92 % (after corporation tax), i.e. 10,19 % (after corporation tax) normal return on equity plus a premium of 0,3 percentage point (after corporation tax) on account of the particularities of the transaction less 3,75 percentage points (after corporation tax) on account of the financing costs resulting from the transferred assets' lack of liquidity for WestLB.
iv) Appropriate remuneration for the amount of DEM 3400 million (EUR 1740 million) (236) As already mentioned, the equity of DEM 3400 million (EUR 1740 million) is also of material value to WestLB and its economic function may be compared to that of a guarantee.
Synergy effects were seen as a positive (side-)effect but were certainly not the main driving force behind the transaction at that time. (239) The German authorities and WestLB claim that the Land had not only received the payment of 0,6 % on the amount of DEM 2500 million (EUR 1280 million) but also benefited from synergy effects worth about DEM 30 million (EUR 15 million) annually as a result of the transfer and integration of Wfa and WestLB's takeover of Wfa's pension obligations totalling DEM 33 million (EUR 17 million).
The cost savings from synergies arise from the merger of Wfa with the former housing promotion division of WestLB, which led to an organisational streamlining of the Land's housing promotion activities and a reduction in staff. (240) Synergy effects are the normal consequence of a merger.
The benefits should arise within the housing promotion business and therefore increase the funds available there. (244) The Commission takes the view, therefore, that the claimed synergy effects do not represent a remuneration paid by WestLB for the transfer of Wfa, but it is prepared to regard the amount of DEM 33 million (EUR 17 million) paid by WestLB in 1992 for Wfa's pension costs as part of the remuneration paid by WestLB for the transfer.
This remuneration was first paid for 1993.
As explained above, the Commission accepts the payments by WestLB in 1992 for Wfa's pension claims as additional remuneration for the Land. (249) The aid element can be calculated as the difference between the actual payments and the payments which would correspond to market conditions. (250) Table 5: Calculation of the aid element (Amount: DEM 1913,80 million = EUR 978,51 million) (DEM million) | | 1992 | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | | | | | | | | | | | | | 1.Part of special reserve available to WestLB | 13 | 2510 | 2819 | 3048 | 3108 | 3112 | 3113 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | 2.Remainder (difference vis-à-vis DEM 5900) in 2002 at a proportional rate of 7/12 | 5887 | 3390 | 3081 | 2852 | 2792 | 2788 | 2787 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | | | | | | | | | | | | | Remuneration of 6,92 % (after tax) on point 1 | 0,9 | 173,7 | 195,1 | 210,9 | 215,1 | 215,4 | 215,4 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Remuneration of 0,3 % (after tax) on point 2 | 17,7 | 10,2 | 9,2 | 8,6 | 8,4 | 8,4 | 8,4 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Total remuneration in line with market conditions | 18,6 | 183,9 | 204,3 | 219,5 | 223,5 | 223,8 | 223,8 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | | | | | | | | | | | | | Actual remuneration (after tax) | 33,1 | 15,1 | 16,9 | 18,3 | 18,6 | 18,7 | 18,7 | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] [51] | | | | | | | | | | | | | Aid element | -14,5 | 168,8 | 187,4 | 201,2 | 204,9 | 205,1 | 205,1 | 208,6 | 209,3 | 209,3 | 128,6 | 4.
TAX EXEMPTIONS (251) As stated in the Commission decision to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty, state aid may be involved if a particular enterprise is exempt from taxes whereas its competitors are subject to normal taxation.
If the construction of an "entity within an entity" involves a non-profit, tax-exempt entity, steps have to be taken to ensure that the economic effects of tax privileges are limited strictly to the non-profit entity and do not spill over to the enterprise in the competitive sector. (252) WestLB was subject to neither property tax (Vermögenssteuer) nor tax on business capital (Gewerbekapitalsteuer) on the transferred capital.
If the remuneration were fixed at an appropriate level, there would have been no distortion of competition in favour of WestLB as a result of the tax exemptions for the housing promotion business.
According to the above calculations, an appropriate level would be 6,92 % per annum and 0,3 % per annum respectively. 5.
The German authorities also state that, without the waiver, BAKred would not have accepted DEM 4000 million (EUR 2050 million) as original own funds of Wfa. (256) The waiver has certainly increased Wfa's value.
On this basis, an assessment has to be made as to whether that aid can be considered compatible with the common market.
This might, in principle, also apply to restructuring aid in the banking sector.
This has been confirmed by the Commission in its report on "Services of general economic interest in the banking sector" [52].
However, it is clear that the transfer was effected in order to allow WestLB to comply with the new own funds requirements and with no regard to any services of general economic interest.
Therefore, this exemption clause does not apply either in the case at hand. (263) Since no exemption from the principle of the ban on state aid pursuant to Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty applies, the aid in question cannot be found compatible with the Treaty.
This aid is therefore illegal. (265) The aid cannot be found compatible either under Article 87(2) or (3) or under any other provision of the EC Treaty.
Article 2 Germany shall take all necessary measures to recover from the beneficiary the aid referred to in Article 1 and unlawfully made available to the beneficiary.
Interest shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter V of Commission Regulation (EC) No 794/2004 [53].
Article 5 This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.
Done at Brussels, 20 October 2004.
This results in an average available capital for WestLB of DEM 13 million (EUR 7 million) for that year. [30] (#)Since Wfa's capital could be used for underpinning commercial activities only until 1 August 2002 as a result of the split-up of WestLB, the difference of [...] between the total amount of recognised original own funds of [...] and the amount of DEM 632 million tied up by Wfa needs to be multiplied by a factor of 7/12.
However, the principal reasoning holds. [46] The situation does not change if one takes into account the possibility of raising additional own funds up to the same amount of original own funds (a factor of 25 instead of 12,5 for original own funds). [47] The chosen minimum remuneration is also supported by statements and studies on actual and expected returns on equity made by investment banks and consultancy firms.
Salomon Brothers puts the equity return for most European banks at between 10 % and 14 %, Merryl Lynch estimates a figure of some 11,8 % for different German banks and WestLB Panmure gives a figure of between 11,8 % and 12,3 %. [48] In the decision to initiate proceedings under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty, the Commission, on the basis of information provided at the time by WestLB, indicated a provisional rate of 7 %. [49] According to documents provided by the German Government, the corporate income tax rate was 42 % in 1995 and 1996, with a solidarity surcharge of 7,5 %, i.e. 49,5 % in total.
In terms of the relevant period from 1 January to 1 August 2002 ([...] multiplied by the factor of 7/12), an amount of [...] was thus paid as remuneration. [52] This report was presented to the ECOFIN Council on 23 November 1998 but has not been published.
It can be obtained from Competition Directorate-General IV of the Commission and can also be found on the Commission's website. [53] OJ L 140, 30.4.2004, p. 1. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMISSION DECISION 1.
