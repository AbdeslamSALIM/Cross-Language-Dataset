The potency of blood-grouping reagents for which International Standard Preparations exist (at present anti-A and anti-B and incomplete anti-D) can be expressed in International Units (see Bull, Wld.
Org. 1954, 10, 937, 941-1950, 3, 301) on the basis of the titration of the unknown reagent in comparison with the International Standard, or a national sub-standard.
The following table shows an example of a comparative titration of the International Standard anti-A Serum (S) and an %quot%unknown%quot% anti-A reagent (U) against A1 red corpuscles and A2B red corpuscles. %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0045086%quot%%gt% 4.
Any added colouring matter must not interfere with the specific reaction. 7.
Each consignment shall be accompanied by a certificate as provided in Article 4 of the Agreement and the Annex to the present Protocol.
SPECIFIC PROVISIONS A.
those of blood groups 0 and B.
Potency Titration An anti-A serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1, A2, and A2B corpuscles, in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation.
The potency of the serum shall in each case be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
The potency of the serum shall be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
Potency Titration An anti-A + anti-B (group 0) serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1, and A2 corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent standard preparation.
The potency of the serum shall in every case be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
Anti-A + anti-B (group 0) blood-grouping serum used undiluted shall also give readily detectable agglutination of group Ax (Ay or Ao) corpuscles.
It shall have a potency of not less than 32 International Units.
Most diagnostic anti-C sera contain %quot%complete%quot% anti-C together with %quot%incomplete%quot% anti-D.
Potency Titration Anti-C sera (%quot%complete%quot% or %quot%incomplete%quot%) should have a titre of not less than 8 against Ccddee corpuscles.
Potency Titration Anti-E sera (%quot%complete%quot% or %quot%incomplete%quot%) should have a titre of not less than 8 against ccddEe corpuscles.
The titres should not be less than those specified for the component antibodies, but in the case of anti-D + C (which is a frequent combination in the serum of immunized persons) it is desirable that the anti-C titre should be not less than 32 and in the case of anti-D + E it is desirable that the anti-E titre should be not less than 8.
those of blood groups A and AB, including sub-groups A1, A2, A1B and A2B, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain A antigen, i.e.
Potency Titration An anti-A serum shall be titrated separately against suspensions of A1, A2, and A2B red corpuscles, in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-A blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation (1).
The potency of the serum shall in each case be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
those of blood groups B and AB, and does not agglutinate human red corpuscles which do not contain B antigen, i.e.
Potency Titration An anti-B serum shall be titrated against a suspension of group B corpuscles in parallel with the reconstituted but undiluted International Standard Preparation of anti-B blood-grouping serum or an equivalent reference preparation (1).
The potency of the serum shall be not less than 64 International Units per ml.
red corpuscles sensitized with human incomplete antibodies anti-D, anti-K and anti-Fya, red corpuscles sensitized with complement-binding incomplete antibodies anti-Lea in the presence of fresh human serum, and red corpuscles sensitized with socalled %quot%incomplete cold antibodies%quot% (1) The International Standard Preparation is of human origin ; an equivalent reference preparation, if used, may be of human or non-human origin.
