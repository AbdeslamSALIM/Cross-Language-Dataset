Accordingly, Portugal is invited to achieve full compliance with the data requirements of the code of conduct. (2) The update of the stability programme is built around the need to correct a government deficit which at 6,2 % of GDP in 2005 is planned to be well in excess of 3 % of GDP.
The government deficit is expected to continuously improve over the coming years, but will exceed the 3 % of GDP reference value until 2007. (3) The macroeconomic scenario underlying the programme envisages that real GDP growth will progressively pick up from 0,8 % in 2005 to 3,0 % in 2009, with growth rates of successively 1,4 %, 2,2 % and 2,6 % in the intermediate years.
The government deficit ratio is expected to decline from 6,2 % of GDP in 2005 to 4,8 % in 2006, 3,9 % in 2007, 2,8 % in 2008 and 1,6 % in 2009.
Calculations by the Commission services applying the commonly agreed methodology to the information in the programme show that the cyclically-adjusted deficit, after widening to 5,3 % of GDP in 2005, will decline progressively to 1,4 % in 2009.
In the early part of the programme period, consolidation is relying mainly on increasing revenues, through higher tax rates (notably an increase in the standard VAT rate from 19 % to 21 %), lower tax credits and improved tax collection, which partly offset the one-off revenues foregone.
It is also insufficient to ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact's medium-term objective of a budgetary position of close to balance is achieved within the programme horizon, in spite of a reduction in the underlying deficit from 2005 to 2009 of around 4 percentage points of GDP.
A sensitivity analysis shows that the deficit would still be at 3 %, or very close to it, in 2009, in the event of unfavourable macroeconomic developments. (6) The debt-to-GDP ratio breached the 60 % of GDP reference value of the Treaty in 2003, moving up to 61,9 % in 2004.
According to the update, after reaching 66,5 % of GDP in 2005, it will peak at 67,8 % of GDP, declining thereafter until it reaches 64,5 % in 2009.
However, it does not plan to reduce the deficit below 3 % of GDP before 2008, and the planned expenditure restraint will be insufficient to achieve the medium-term objective of the Stability and Growth Pact of a budgetary position of close to balance by the end of the programme period. (9) In the light of the deficit and debt figures for 2005 and following years presented in the updated stability programme, the Commission initiated the excessive deficit procedure for Portugal on 22 June.
However, in view of the upcoming general elections in Portugal, it was at the time decided not to assess that programme, but to wait for the update to be presented by the new government.
