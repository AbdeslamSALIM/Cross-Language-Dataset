Article 5 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Item 2.2.1 shall read as follows: %quot%2.2.1.
H is a reference point as defined in Item 1.1 of Annex III to Directive 77/649/EEC which must be determined in accordance with the procedure set out in that Directive. 4.1.1.1.
Point H' is the reference point corresponding to H as defined in Item 4.1.1 and shall be determined for all normal positions in which the seat is used. 4.1.1.2.
Point R is the seat reference point defined in Item 1.2 of Annex III to Directive 77/649/EEC. %quot% Item 4.1.2 shall read as follows: %quot%4.1.2.
Point C is the point situated 450 mm vertically above point R.
However, if the distance S defined in Item 4.1.6 is not less than 280 mm and if the alternative formula BR = 280 mm + 0 78 S specified in Item 4.4.4.3 is chosen by the manufacturer, the vertical distance between C and R shall be 500 mm.%quot% Item 4.1.5.
Item 4.1.6.2.1 shall read as follows: %quot%4.1.6.2.1.
If a strap guide or similar device is used which affects the location of the effective upper belt anchorage, this location shall be determined in a conventional way by considering the position of the anchorage when the longitudinal centre line of the strap passes through a point J1 defined successively from point R by the following three segments: RZ, which is a segment of the reference line measured in an upward direction from R and 530 mm long, ZX, which is a segment perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle, measured from point Z in the direction of the anchorage and 120 mm long, XJ1, which is a segment perpendicular to the plane defined by segments RZ and ZX, measured in a forward direction from point X and 60 mm long.
Item 4.4.4.6 shall read as follows: %quot%4.4.4.6.
in the case of a single anchorage, inside the area common to two dihedra defined by the verticals passing through points J1 and J2 as defined in Item 4.4.4.1 and whose horizontal sections are defined by Figure 2 in Annex III; 4.4.4.7.3.2.
in the case of two anchorages, inside whichever of the above defined dihedra is suitable, provided that each anchorage is not more than 50 mm distant from the symetrically located, mirror-image position of the other anchorage about plane P, defined in Item 4.1.6, of the seat under consideration. %quot% 4.5.1.
After Item 4.5.1, the following new items 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 shall be added: %quot% 4.5.2.
The position of the seats shall be stated in the report.
The following shall be added: %quot%In the case of vehicles in categories other than M1 and N1, the test load shall be 675 ± 20 daN.%quot% Item 5.4.3.
The following shall be added: %quot%In the case of vehicles in categories other than M1 and N1, the test load shall be 1 110 ± 20 daN.%quot% Item 5.4.4.2.
The following shall be added: %quot%In the case of vehicles in categories other than M1 and N1, this force must be equal to 10 times the weight of the complete seat.%quot% After Item 5.4.4.2, the following new Item 5.4.5 shall be added: %quot% 5.4.5.
At the same time, a tractive force of 1 350 ± 20 daN shall be applied to a traction device (see Annex IV, Figure 3) attached to the two lower belt anchorages. 5.4.5.3.
