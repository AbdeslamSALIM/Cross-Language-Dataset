Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC. (5) The use of the growth promoter Formi LHS (potassium diformate) was provisionally authorised, for the first time, for piglets and pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1334/2001 [3].
The person responsible for putting into circulation Formi LHS (potassium diformate) submitted an application to obtain a provisional authorisation for extension of use for four years, as a growth promoter for sows, according to Article 4 of that Directive.
The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9a(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied.
Accordingly, the use of this preparation, as specified in Annex I, should be authorised for four years. (6) The use of the micro-organism Bacillus cereus var.
New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without time-limit of that micro-organism.
The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied.
New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without time-limit of that micro-organism.
