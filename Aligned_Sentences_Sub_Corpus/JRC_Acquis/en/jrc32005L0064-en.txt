It is therefore necessary to amend that Directive accordingly. (14) The measures necessary for the adaptation to scientific and technical progress of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure provided for in Article 13(3) of Directive 70/156/EEC. (15) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to minimise the impact of end-of-life vehicles on the environment by requiring that vehicles be designed from the conception phase with a view to facilitating reuse, recycling and recovery, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting alone and can, therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
Article 2 Scope This Directive shall apply to vehicles belonging to categories M1 and N1, as defined in Part A of Annex II to Directive 70/156/EEC, and to new or reused component parts of such vehicles.
Article 3 Exemptions Without prejudice to the application of the provisions of Article 7, this Directive shall not apply to: (a) special purpose vehicles as defined in part A, point 5, of Annex II to Directive 70/156/EEC; (b) multi-stage built vehicles belonging to category N1, provided that the base vehicle complies with this Directive; (c) vehicles produced in small series, referred to in Article 8(2)(a) of Directive 70/156/EEC.
Article 4 Definitions For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply: 1. "vehicle" means a motor vehicle; 2. "component part" means any part or any assembly of parts which is included in a vehicle at the time of its production.
Article 5 Type-approval provisions 1.
Article 6 Preliminary assessment of the manufacturer 1.
Member States shall not grant any type approval without first ensuring that the manufacturer has put in place satisfactory arrangements and procedures, in accordance with point 3 of Annex IV, to manage properly the reusability, recyclability and recoverability aspects covered by this Directive.
Member States shall appoint a competent body, in accordance with point 2 of Annex IV, to carry out the preliminary assessment of the manufacturer and to issue the certificate of compliance. 5.
Article 7 Reuse of component parts The component parts listed in Annex V shall: (a) be deemed to be non-reusable for the purposes of calculating the recyclability and recoverability rates; (b) not be reused in the construction of vehicles covered by Directive 70/156/EEC.
Article 8 Amendments to Directive 70/156/EEC Directive 70/156/EEC shall be amended in accordance with Annex VI to this Directive.
Article 9 Amendments Amendments to this Directive which are necessary to adapt it to scientific and technical progress shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 13(3) of Directive 70/156/EEC.
Article 10 Implementation dates for type-approval 1.
With effect from 15 December 2006, Member States shall not, in respect of a type of vehicle which complies with the requirements of this Directive: (a) refuse to grant EC or national type-approval, (b) prohibit the registration, sale or entry into service of new vehicles. 2.
With effect from 15 December 2008, Member States shall, in respect of a type of vehicle which does not comply with the requirements of this Directive: (a) refuse to grant EC type-approval; (b) refuse to grant national type-approval. 3.
With effect from 15 July 2010, Member States shall, if the requirements of this Directive are not met: (a) consider certificates of conformity which accompany new vehicles as no longer valid for the purposes of Article 7(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC; (b) refuse the registration, sale or entry into service of new vehicles, save where Article 8(2)(b) of Directive 70/156/EEC applies. 4.
Article 7 shall apply with effect from 15 December 2006.
Member States shall adopt and publish, not later than 15 December 2006, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
They shall apply those measures from 15 December 2006.
Article 12 Entry into force This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 13 Addressees This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

Vehicles belonging to category M1 and those belonging to category N1 shall be so constructed as to be: - reusable and/or recyclable to a minimum of 85 % by mass, and - reusable and/or recoverable to a minimum of 95 % by mass, as determined by the procedures laid down in this Annex. 2.
For the purposes of type-approval, the manufacturer shall submit a data presentation form duly completed, established in accordance with Annex A to the standard ISO 22628: 2002.
For the application of points 1 and 2, the manufacturer shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the approval authority that the reference vehicles meet the requirements.
The calculation method prescribed in Annex B to the standard ISO 22628: 2002 shall apply.
Masses shall be expressed in kg with one decimal place.
The rates shall be calculated in percent with one decimal place, then rounded as follows: (a) if the figure following the decimal point is between 0 and 4, the total is rounded down; (b) if the figure following the decimal point is between 5 and 9, the total is rounded up. 8.
For the purposes of checking the calculations referred to in this Annex, the approval authority shall ensure that the data presentation form referred to in point 2 is coherent with the recommended strategy annexed to the certificate of compliance referred to in Article 6(1) of this Directive. 9.
