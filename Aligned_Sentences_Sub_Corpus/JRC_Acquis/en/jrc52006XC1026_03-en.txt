Geographical area : The production and packing area is located in the province of Foggia (Region of Apulia) and includes the municipalities of Vico del Gargano, Ischitella and Rodi Garganico, specifically a section of the northern part of the Gargano promontory — part coastal and part sub-coastal — from Vico del Gargano and Rodi Garganico up to Ischitella.
The groves are planted in the traditional pattern, a quincunx, at a density of between 250 and 400 trees per hectare.
A third but no less important aspect is its high preservation capacity, which in the past enabled Arancia del Gargano to be transported for 30 or even 40 days to arrive intact in Chicago or New York.
