Article 2 Objective of the management plan 1.
The plan shall aim to bring the spawning stock biomass of Bay of Biscay sole above the precautionary level of 13000 tonnes in 2008 or before and, thereafter, to ensure its sustainable exploitation. 2.
Article 3 Legislative measures and annual TAC setting 1.
Once the spawning stock biomass is evaluated by ICES to be equal to or above the precautionary level of 13000 tonnes, the Council shall decide by qualified majority, on the basis of a Commission proposal, on: (a) a long-term target fishing mortality rate; and (b) a rate of reduction in the fishing mortality rate for application until the target fishing mortality rate decided under (a) has been reached. 2.
CHAPTER II TOTAL ALLOWABLE CATCH Article 4 Procedure for setting the TAC 1.
Where the spawning stock biomass of Bay of Biscay sole has been estimated by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), in the light of the most recent report from ICES, to be below 13000 tonnes, the Council shall decide on a TAC which, according to the STECF estimation, shall not exceed a level of catches which will result in a 10 % reduction in fishing mortality rate in its year of application compared to the fishing mortality rate estimated for the preceding year. 2.
Where the spawning stock biomass of Bay of Biscay sole has been estimated by the STECF, in the light of the most recent report from ICES, to be equal to or above 13000 tonnes, the Council shall decide on a TAC which shall be set at a level of catches which, according to the STECF estimation, is the higher of: (a) that TAC whose application conforms with the reduction in fishing mortality rate that has been decided on by the Council in accordance with Article 3(1)(b); (b) that TAC whose application will result in the target fishing mortality rate that has been decided on by the Council in accordance with Article 3(1)(a). 3.
Where application of paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article would result in a TAC which exceeds the TAC of the preceding year by more than 15 %, the Council shall adopt a TAC which is 15 % greater than the TAC of that year. 4.
Where application of paragraph 1 or 2 would result in a TAC which is more than 15 % less than the TAC of the preceding year, the Council shall adopt a TAC which is 15 % less than the TAC of that year.
CHAPTER III FISHING EFFORT LIMITATION Article 5 Special fishing permit concerning Bay of Biscay sole 1.
Within ICES Divisions VIIIa and VIIIb it shall be prohibited to catch and to retain on board, to tranship or to land any quantity of sole in excess of 100 kg in each sea trip, unless the vessel in question holds a Bay of Biscay sole fishing permit. 3.
Each Member State shall calculate the aggregate capacity, in gross tonnes, of its vessels which, in 2002, 2003 or 2004, landed more than 2000 kg of Bay of Biscay sole.
Each Member State shall only issue Bay of Biscay sole fishing permits to its vessels if the aggregate capacity of those vessels does not exceed the difference between the aggregate capacity determined in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article and the capacity of vessels subject to permanent cessation of fishing activity determined in accordance with paragraph 5. 7.
Article 6 Alternative procedure for effort management 1.
By way of derogation from Article 5, a Member State whose quota for Bay of Biscay sole is less than 10 % of the TAC may implement a different method of effort management.
This method shall establish a reference level of fishing effort equal to the fishing effort deployed in the year 2005.
The Member States concerned shall ensure that fishing effort does not exceed the reference level in 2006 and subsequent years. 2.
A Member State taking up the derogation in paragraph 1 of this Article may be requested by the Commission to provide a report on the implementation of any different method of effort management.
In 2009 and in each third successive year the Council shall decide, by qualified majority and on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, on revisions to reference levels established under paragraph 1.
Article 8 Weighing of landings The competent authorities of a Member State shall ensure that any quantity of common sole caught in the Bay of Biscay exceeding 300 kg shall be weighed using auction room scales before sale.
Article 9 Prior notification The master of a Community fishing vessel that has been present in the Bay of Biscay who wishes to tranship any quantity of sole retained on board or to land any quantity of sole in a port or a landing location of a third country shall provide the competent authorities of the flag Member State at least 24 hours prior to transhipping or to landing in a third country, with the following information: (a) the name of the port or landing location; (b) the estimated time of arrival at that port or landing location; (c) the quantities in kilograms live weight of all species of which more than 50 kg is retained on board.
Article 10 Separate stowage of common sole 1.
Article 11 Transport of common sole 1.
By way of derogation from Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93, quantities of common sole exceeding 300 kg which are transported to a place other than that of landing or import shall be accompanied by a copy of one of the declarations provided for in Article 8(1) of that Regulation pertaining to the quantities of the sole transported.
CHAPTER V FOLLOW-UP Article 12 Evaluation of management measures The Commission shall seek scientific advice from the STECF on the rate of progress towards the targets of the management plan in the third year of application of this Regulation and in each third successive year of application of this Regulation.
Article 13 Special circumstances If the STECF advises that the spawning stock size of Bay of Biscay sole is suffering reduced reproductive capacity, the Council shall decide by qualified majority on the basis of a proposal from the Commission on a TAC that is lower than that provided for in Article 4.
CHAPTER VI FINAL PROVISIONS Article 14 Entry into force This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
