BACKGROUND On 11 July 2005 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters[1].
At the plenary session on 4 July 2006, the European Parliament adopted its opinion approving the Commission proposal subject to a number of amendments, and called on the Commission to submit a coordinated and comprehensive version of the Regulation incorporating the amendments by way of its revised proposal.
The amendments adopted by the European Parliament correspond to the text agreed by the Council on 1 June 2006. 2.
Security in transmission requires that the document to be transmitted be accompanied by a standard form, to be completed in the language of the place where service is to be effected, or in another language accepted by the Member State in question. (8) This Regulation should not apply to service of a document on the party's authorized representative in the Member State where the proceedings take place regardless of the place of the residence of that party. (9) The service of a document should be effected as soon as possible, and in any event within one month of receipt by the receiving agency. (10) To secure the effectiveness of this Regulation, the possibility of refusing service of documents should be confined to exceptional situations. (11) In order to facilitate the transmission and service of documents between Member States, the standard forms set out in the Annexes of this Regulation should be used. (12) The receiving agency should inform the addressee in writing using a standard form that he or she may refuse to accept the document to be served at the time of service or by sending the document to the receiving agency within one week if it is not either in a language which he or she understands or in an official language of the place of service.
However, where according to the law of a Member State a document shall be served within a particular period, the date to be taken into account with respect to the applicant should be that fixed by the law of that Member State.
Those Member States where this system applies should communicate this to the Commission which is to publish this information in the Official Journal of the European Union and make it available in the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters established in accordance with decision 2001/470/EC.[9] (16) In order to facilitate access to justice, costs occasioned by the employment of a judicial officer or of a person competent under the law of the Member State addressed should correspond to a single fixed fee laid down by that Member State in advance which respects the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination.
This Regulation shall apply in civil and commercial matters where a judicial or extrajudicial document has to be transmitted from one Member State to another for service there.
Article 2 Transmitting and receiving agencies 1.
A Member State may designate one transmitting agency and one receiving agency or one agency to perform both functions.
Each Member State shall provide the Commission with the following information: (a) the names and addresses of the receiving agencies referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3; (b) the geographical areas in which they have jurisdiction; (c) the means of receipt of documents available to them; and (d) the languages that may be used for the completion of the standard form in Annex I.
Article 3 Central body Each Member State shall designate a central body responsible for: (a) supplying information to the transmitting agencies; (b) seeking solutions to any difficulties which may arise during transmission of documents for service; (c) forwarding, in exceptional cases, at the request of a transmitting agency, a request for service to the competent receiving agency.
CHAPTER II JUDICIAL DOCUMENTS Article 4 Transmission of documents 1.
The form shall be completed in the official language of the Member State addressed or, if there are several official languages in that Member State, the official language or one of the official languages of the place where service is to be effected, or in another language which that Member State has indicated it can accept.
When the transmitting agency wishes a copy of the document to be returned together with the certificate referred to in Article 10, it shall send the document in duplicate.
Article 5 Translation of documents 1.
The applicant shall be advised by the transmitting agency to which he or she forwards the document for transmission that the addressee may refuse to accept it if it is not in one of the languages provided for in Article 8. 2.

The receiving agency shall take all necessary steps to effect the service of the document as soon as possible, and in any event within one month of receipt.
Article 8 Refusal to accept a document 1.
The receiving agency shall inform the addressee, using the standard form in Annex II that he or she may refuse to accept the document to be served at the time of service or by sending the document to the receiving agency within one week if it is not written in, or accompanied by a translation into, either of the following languages: (a) a language which the addressee understands; or (b) the official language of the Member State addressed or, if there are several official languages in that Member State, the official language or one of the official languages of the place where service is to be effected. 2.
Where the receiving agency is informed that the addressee refuses to accept the document in accordance with paragraph 1, it shall immediately inform the transmitting agency by means of the certificate provided for in Article 10 and return the request and the documents of which a translation is requested. 3.
In that case, the date of service of the document shall be the date on which the document accompanied by the translation is served in accordance with the law of the Member State addressed.
Paragraphs (1) to (3) of this Article shall apply to the means of transmission and service of judicial documents under Articles 12 to 15. 5.
For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this Article, the diplomatic or consular agents, where service is effected in accordance with Article 13, or the authority or competent person, where service is effected in accordance with Article 14, shall inform the addressee that he or she may refuse to accept the document and that any document refused must be sent to those entities or to that authority or person respectively.
