Regulation (EEC) No 1617/93 expired on 30 June 2005. (6) In June 2004 the Commission initiated a consultation on the revision of Regulation (EEC) No 1617/93 to determine whether the block exemption should be discontinued, maintained in its current form or extended in scope.
However, the airline industry should be allowed sufficient time to adapt to the new situation and to assess for themselves whether their agreements and practices are compatible with Article 81 of the Treaty and, if necessary, to amend them.
In order to provide a satisfactory degree of security and transparency, arrangements in this respect can only be accepted if all air carriers concerned can participate in the negotiations, and if the allocation is made on a non-discriminatory and transparent basis. (9) A block exemption should be granted until 31 December 2006 in respect of consultations on slot-allocation and airport scheduling in so far as they concern air services the point of origin and/or point of destination of which are located in the Community.
