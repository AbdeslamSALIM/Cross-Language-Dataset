The Decision commits the Community and its Member States to reduce their aggregate anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol by 8 % compared to 1990 levels in the period from 2008 to 2012.
Consequently, Directive 70/156/EEC should be amended accordingly. (10) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely to control the leakage of the specific fluorinated greenhouse gases in the air-conditioning systems fitted to vehicles and to prohibit from a certain date air-conditioning systems designed to contain fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential higher than 150, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting alone and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of this Directive, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
Article 2 Scope The Directive shall apply to motor vehicles of categories M1 and N1 as defined in Annex II of Directive 70/156/EEC.
The global warming potential (GWP) is calculated in terms of the 100 year warming potential of one kilogram of a gas relative to one kilogram of CO2.
The total global warming potential [12] of the preparation shall be determined in accordance with Part 2 of the Annex; 10. "retrofitting" means installing an air-conditioning system in a vehicle after it has been registered.
Article 4 Obligations of the Member States 1.
Article 7 Implementing measures 1.
By 4 July 2007, the Commission shall adopt the measures for the implementation of Article 4 and Article 5, and in particular: (a) the administrative provisions for the EC type-approval of vehicles; and (b) a harmonised leakage detection test for measuring the leakage rate of fluorinated greenhouse gases with a global warming potential higher than 150 from air-conditioning systems. 2.
The Commission shall adopt the measures in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 13 of Directive 70/156/EEC. 3.
The procedure referred to in paragraph 2 shall apply to the adoption, where appropriate, of: (a) measures needed to ensure the safe functioning and proper servicing of refrigerants in mobile air-conditioning systems; (b) measures relating to the retrofitting of in-use vehicles with air-conditioning systems and the refilling of in-use air-conditioning systems to the extent not covered by Article 6; (c) the adaptation of the method for determining the relevant global warming potential of preparations.
Article 8 Review 1.
On the basis of progress in potential containment of emissions from, or replacement of, fluorinated greenhouse gases in air-conditioning systems fitted to motor vehicles, the Commission shall examine whether: - the present legislation should be extended to other categories of vehicles, in particular categories M2 and M3 as well as classes II and III of category N1 and - Community provisions concerning the global warming potential of fluorinated greenhouse gases should be amended; any changes should take account of technological and scientific developments and the need to respect industrial product planning timescales, and shall publish a report by 4 July 2011.
Where a fluorinated greenhouse gas with a global warming potential higher than 150, which is not yet covered by the IPCC report referred to in Article 3(8), is included in a future report of the IPCC, the Commission shall assess whether it is appropriate to amend this Directive in order to include that gas.
Article 9 Amendments to Directive 70/156/EEC Directive 70/156/EEC is hereby amended in accordance with Part 1 of the Annex to this Directive.
Member States shall adopt and publish by 4 January 2008 the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
They shall apply those measures from 5 January 2008.
Article 11 Entry into force This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 12 Addressees This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

For example: applying the formula to a theoretical blend of gases consisting of 23 % HFC-32; 25 % HFC-125 and 52 % HFC-134a; Σ (23 % × 550) + (25 % × 3400) + (52 % × 1300) → Total GWP = 1652,5. --------------------------------------------------
