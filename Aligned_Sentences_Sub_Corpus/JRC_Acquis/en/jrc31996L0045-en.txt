Calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2 72H2O) 3.10.
Reference solutions Prepare 0,1 % (m/V) solutions of each of the reference substances 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16 and 3.17 in methanol. 3.19.
Development solvent Mix 88 volumes of n-pentane (3.4) with 12 volumes of glacial acetic acid (3.6). 4.
Waterbath, capable of maintaining a temperature of 60 °C 4.2.
Ultraviolet light source, 254 nm 4.4.
Woollen paint roller, length approximately 10 cm, outside diameter approximately 3,5 cm.
Temperature setting: about 80 °C.
The hot plate shall be covered with an aluminium plate of 20 cm × 20 cm and a thickness of about 6 mm, to obtain a uniform heat distribution. 5.
For strongly basic cosmetic products, such as toilet-soap, 20 drops of hydrochloric acid solution shall be added.
Close the tube, gently heat the mixture to approximately 60 °C to facilitate the extraction of the preservatives into the acetone phase and shake vigourously for one minute.
Shake vigorously again for one minute.
Adjust the pH of the mixture to approximately 10 with potassium hydroxide (3.8), using pH indicator paper.
Filter the solution through a filter paper into a 250-ml separating funnel containing 75 ml diethylether and shake vigorously for one minute.
Subsequently, add 10 ml diethylether and shake vigorously for one minute.
Transfer 100 ml of the development solvent (3.19) into a developing tank (4.2).
Place the TLC plate immediately in the unsaturated chamber and develop at room temperature until the solvent front has run about 15 cm from the base line.
Heat the plate for 30 minutes in an oven (4.5) at 100 °C to remove excess acetic acid.

Sample preparation 6.1.1.
Sample preparation without addition of the internal standard Weigh approximately 1,0 g of sample in a 100-ml glass tube with screw cap.
Place the tube for five minutes in a waterbath (5.1) kept at 60 °C ± 1 °C to facilitate the extraction of the preservatives into the ethanol phase.
Immediately cool the tube in a stream of cold water and store the extract in the refrigerator for one hour.

Immediately cool the tube in a stream of cold tap water and store the extract in the refrigerator for one hour.
Store the extract in the refrigerator and perform the HPLC determinations within 24 hours. 6.2.
Determination Inject 10 ìl of the sample solution without internal standard (6.1.1) into the chromatograph and record the chromatogram.
Inject 10 ìl of one of the standard preservative solutions (4.19) and record the chromatogram.
If, in the chromatogram of the sample extract (6.1.1), no peak is present having approximately the same retention time as isopropylparaben (recommended internal standard), continue by injecting 10 ìl sample solution with internal standard (6.1.2).
