Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the %lsquo%Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: The future of the textiles and clothing sector in the enlarged European Union%rsquo%. (COM(2003) 649 final) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the "Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: The future of the textiles and clothing sector in the enlarged European Union". (COM(2003) 649 final) (2004/C 302/19) On 28 October 2003, the Commission decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 262 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned proposal.
At its 410th plenary session of 30 June and 1 July 2004 (meeting of 1 July), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 81 votes to one. 1.
While the EU applies customs tariffs of less than 9 % on average, many other countries apply tariffs of up to 30 %, in addition to hefty non-tariff barriers. 1.4 In Europe, the textiles and clothing sector has managed to cope with series of radical changes and has been quick to take advantage of new technology to find an appropriate response to different production costs, reacting promptly to the emergence of new global competitors.
Naturally, almost 70 % of this went to the textile sector, while the clothing sector received around 30 %.
The communication also provides for regular reports to be drawn up between spring 2005 and the end of 2006. 3.
One effect of this would be to make it easier to guide consumers towards "ethical" products in terms of both their intrinsic quality and compliance with workers' rights in the production process. 4.6 The culture of corporate social responsibility should be consolidated as a European model, but must also be extended to the developing countries through specific instruments which could be checked at consumer level and whose trade-related aspects would therefore be significant [12]. 4.7 Environmental and workplace safety legislation in force in industry must be made more visible to consumers, in order to boost competitive advantage. 4.7.1 The Union's clear-cut position on sustainable development and, consequently, on compliance with the timetable of the Kyoto Protocol, can be successful and meet with the approval of the European manufacturing sector, provided that it is accompanied by an acknowledgement of the efforts entailed by these commitments.
The heading "Articles of apparel and clothing accessories", indicated by codes 61, 62 and 63 includes 466 items; of these 398 attract a tariff of 12 %, with the other 68 having tariffs ranging from complete exemption to 2 %, 4 %, 5.3 %, 6.2 %, 6.3 %, 6.5 %, 6.9 %, 7.2 %, 7.5 %, 7.6 %, 7.7 %, 8 %, 8.9 %, 10 % and 10.5 %.
Other codes: 64 (Footwear, gaiters and the like), 65 (Headgear and parts thereof), 66 (Umbrellas) and 67 (Feathers and artificial flowers) have tariffs of 1.7 %, 2.2 %, 2.7 %, 4.7 %, 5 %, 5.2 %, 7 % and 8 %. 4.13.1 There are more than 20 tariff levels for the total of 1,516 headings covered by codes 50 to 67 of the Combined Nomenclature (CN).
Whilst it is true that the current GSP cuts CCT levels by 40 %, thus enabling all the developing countries to export their textile, clothing and footwear products to EU countries with a tariff of less than 5 % provided that they undertake to observe the social and environmental clauses, it has nevertheless proved unsuccessful as a moral campaign.
In order to ensure that GSP assistance is concentrated on the countries with the greatest need, the Committee recommends that the following categories of country be excluded from the system: - nations which are members of OPEC [19]; - nations which are not defined by the UN as "developing countries"; - nations which have a nuclear weapons programme; - nations which serve as tax havens; - nations which have bilateral or regional agreements with the EU [20]; - nations which do not comply with the fundamental rights enshrined by the ILO [21]. 4.17 The Technological Poles and Innovation Centres – widespread across the EU – must help to improve networking and dissemination of experience with entrepreneurs in the industry, universities and civil society organisations. 4.18 Technical, high-tech textiles and technical footwear are increasingly gaining market share in Europe and globally.
Special attention should be given to those EU countries where the textile and clothing sectors have a strategic importance. 4.19.2 The professional profiles required to help businesses improve and expand production of technical textiles and footwear include: technology audit analysts, restructuring plan facilitators, and people skilled in business opportunity scouting. 4.19.3 The EESC is convinced that by harnessing existing local opportunities – technology poles, universities, Structured Dialogue between employers, workers and local authorities – businesses, and SMEs in particular, could benefit from cooperation with these new types of skilled professional in order to migrate to a higher level of competitive technology [22]. 4.20 The Committee is also aware, as is the Commission and the European Parliament, that small firms (with fewer than 50 employees) account for approximately 70 % of the EU's textiles, clothing and footwear industry; circa 20 % of firms have between 50 and 249 employees and the remaining 10 % employ 250 or more.
The most blatant examples of fraud include: - declarations inconsistent with products that have cleared customs [23]; - goods with no certification of conformity, which are often dangerous for consumers; - goods produced which do not comply with intellectual property rights; - goods subjected to triangulation between various States [24]; - goods that do not comply with the rules of origin [25]; - counterfeit or pirated goods. 4.21.1 Some statistical surveys were recently carried out into this phenomenon.
The EESC welcomes the fact that the European Union has finally adopted a Regulation that provides for counterfeit goods to be burned and destroyed by customs [26]. 4.21.2 The Committee feels, however, that success in this area remains limited. 4.21.3 Indeed, customs agency directors complain about the shortcomings of Community regulation (which ought to compensate for fragmented national legislation), and the lack of staff and resources to deal with such a vast, active market. 4.21.4 In the first half of 2003, over 50 million counterfeit or bootleg products were intercepted by European customs [27].
The tariffs imposed by China are 20 %, by Thailand 29 %, by India 35 %, and by Indonesia 40 % [32]. 5.2 Euro-Mediterranean manufacturers of TCF continue to run up against obstacles in accessing Asian markets.
In order to obstruct trade, these markets have created non-tariff barriers which pose a serious problem for European industry as a whole [33]. 5.3 Within EU manufacturing industry as a whole, textiles value added accounts for some 2.5 % [34].
Some countries, however, have relatively higher levels: Luxembourg 8.7 %; Portugal 6.3 %; Greece 5.1 %; Italy 4.6 %; Belgium 4.3 % [35].
The EU must step up its efforts to ensure that ILO principles on the protection of workers become a WTO touchstone. 6.2 Preferential customs tariffs could be applied only to the 49 least developed countries.

[21] Ibidem [22] Small businesses would often like to switch from producing garments made from traditional products to new ones made from technical or intelligent textiles, but they lack the necessary information and knowledge of technical and commercial processes. [23] The customs tariff percentage depends on the type of product imported.
Often they are declared as various products, with lower tariffs than for those actually imported. [24] Green Paper on The future of rules of origin in preferential trade agreements, COM(2003) 787 final, point 1.2.2. [25] Ibidem. [26] Regulation (EC) 1383/2003 of 22.7.2003.
