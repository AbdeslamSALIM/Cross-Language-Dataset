Report from the Commission RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SEA DIRECTIVE AND COMMUNITY FUNDS {SEC(2006) 1375} /* COM/2006/0639 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 27.10.2006 COM(2006) 639 final REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SEA DIRECTIVE AND COMMUNITY FUNDS {SEC(2006) 1375} REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SEA DIRECTIVE AND COMMUNITY FUNDS 1.
BACKGROUND TO AND PURPOSE OF THE REPORT Directive 2001/42/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (the ‘Strategic Environmental Assessment’ (SEA) Directive)[1] was adopted in July 2001 and was to be transposed in the Member States by 21 July 2004.
THE ENVIRONMENT AND EU CO-FINANCING The EC Treaty provides in Article 6 that environmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of EU policies.
For the current programming period of Structural Funds, Council Regulation (EC) Nº 1260/1999 takes into account Article 6 of the EC Treaty by linking pursuit of the Funds' priority objectives with, inter alia , sustainable development and the protection and improvement of the environment (Article 1), and by requiring the Commission and the Member States to integrate the requirements of environmental protection in the definition and implementation of the operations of the Structural Funds (Article 2).
For the next programming period (2007-2013) , the funding process has been simplified and decentralised.
Although ex ante evaluation is required for Operational Programmes (OPs), it is not required for National Strategic Reference Frameworks (NSRFs) (or National Strategic Plans in EAFRD and EFF) nor is a separate ex ante environmental evaluation now required (being in effect superseded by the SEA Directive.
It also makes clear that the objectives of the Funds shall be pursued in the framework of sustainable development and the Community promotion of the goal of protecting and improving the environment as set out in Article 6 of the Treaty (Article 17).
APPLYING THE SEA DIRECTIVE TO PLANS AND PROGRAMMES UNDER COMMUNITY FUNDS The SEA Directive applies to any plan or programme which comes within its scope of application as defined in Articles 2 and 3.
The requirement under Article 47 of Regulation 1083/2006 for evaluations to take account of Community legislation concerning environmental impact and strategic environmental assessment emphasises that the respective directives apply when the criteria they contain are met.
The key test in deciding on application in this context is normally whether the OP in question sets the framework for future development consent of projects since it is expected that the other criteria (those in Article 2) will be met in relation to OPs.
The main differences between the SEA procedure and best practice in the ex ante environmental assessment of plans and programmes in the current programming round can be summarised as follows: (i) under the Directive, environmental authorities must be consulted on the scope and level of detail of the information to be included in the environmental report; (ii) there is a formal requirement to consider reasonable alternatives in the SEA; (iii) the information requirements of the Directive are expressed more fully and rigorously, and explicitly include an assessment of environmental problems and objectives and how they have been taken into account (see Annex 3 below); (iv) the Directive contains a formal requirement to consult the general public (and, explicitly, environmental authorities) on the plan or programme and the environmental report and it provides for transboundary consultation when appropriate; and (v) the environmental report and the results of consultation must be taken into account during the preparation of the plan or programme and, when it is adopted, a statement summarizing how this has been done must be made available to the public, environmental authorities and any Member States consulted.
Amongst other sources of information, practical guidance on application of SEA in the context of the Cohesion Policy can be found in a handbook produced in early 2006 by the Greening Regional Development Programmes Network (GRDP).[19] 7.
CONCLUSION The ex ante environmental evaluations carried out for the current period to 2006 appear to have had a beneficial influence on the design of SF programmes thanks to a more developed approach when compared with the preceding period (up to 2000).
