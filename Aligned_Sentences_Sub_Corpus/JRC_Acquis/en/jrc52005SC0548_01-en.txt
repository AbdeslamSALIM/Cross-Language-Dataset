EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
INTRODUCTION This Preliminary Draft Amending Budget contains the following elements in section III – Commission: - the mobilisation of new funds for an amount of EUR 98 million, in favour of the rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance to the earthquake/Tsunami affected countries (mainly Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Maldives).
These new funds will come from the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument; - the modification of the remarks of budget line 19 10 04 - Rehabilitation and reconstruction operations in developing countries in Asia - by adding the ALA regulation as legal base to this budget line.
This will allow the use of the most appropriate implementation modes for the Tsunami aid; - the modification of the remarks of budget line 05 08 03 - Restructuring of systems for agricultural surveys - to take account of a special subsidy to be granted to the OECD and by adding to the existing legal basis a reference to the Commission institutional prerogatives.
As far as the financing of the post earthquake/Tsunami disaster actions is concerned, the Commission has foreseen two different phases: - an amount of EUR 123 million has already been made available as emergency aid on the 2005 budget, of which EUR 23 million under line 23 02 01 - Aid, including emergency food aid, to help the populations of the developing countries and other third countries hit by disasters or serious crises - and EUR 100 million through the mobilisation of the emergency aid reserve in agreement with the budgetary authority; - a total amount of EUR 350 million will be made available for reconstruction and rehabilitation over 2005 and 2006.
This amount will be financed as follows: - EUR 170 million in 2005, of which EUR 98 million of new funds through the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument as specified above.
The remaining EUR 72 million will be financed by the Asia envelope for EUR 60 million and by the Rapid Reaction Mechanism for EUR 12 million, - EUR 180 million are foreseen in the Preliminary Draft Budget for 2006, of which EUR 150 million of new funds to be financed through the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument and EUR 30 million by the Asia envelope. 1.1.
This pledge was endorsed by the European Parliament Resolution of 13 January (B6-0034/2005) on “EU aid for tidal wave victims in the Indian Ocean” and by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 31 January.
The Commission deployed two programming missions involving European Investment Bank (EIB) to the Maldives in January and to Sri Lanka and Indonesia early February.
The results of these missions have formed basis, together with the World Bank (WB) needs assessments, for the intended programme of EUR 350 million as set out below: - EUR 323 million under the Tsunami Indicative Programme, - EUR 12 million under the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM), - EUR 15 million from the Asia-wide programmes, Out of the EUR 323 million, EUR 200 million will be allocated for Indonesia, EUR 95 million for Sri Lanka, and EUR 16 million for the Maldives.
It also shows the need for additional funds, of which EUR 98 million are requested under this amending budget, and EUR 150 million being included in the Preliminary Draft Budget for 2006. (Commitments in million EUR) 2005 | 2006 | 2005 - 2006 | RRM | ASIA CHAPTER | TOTAL | ASIA CHAPTER | TOTAL | TOTAL | Indonesia : The Government of Indonesia (GoI) prepared a “Master Plan” for Aceh and North Sumatra Rehabilitation and Reconstruction.
The Plan was presented to the President of the Republic of Indonesia on 24 March 2005.
The Plan consists of a Main Book (a main document with the purpose of the plan and the overall content) and 11 planning books (with the details) referring to relevant sectors.
At the moment, intensive consultations are taking place in Aceh and there is a possibility that the Plan will be revised, in particular to take account of the earthquake that took place in the west of North Sumatra and southwest of Aceh.
Funding needs: Disbursement needed | Amount | Comments | June/July 2005 | EUR 30 million (Old Funds) | 1st tranche (contribution to the Multi-Donors Trust Fund, Indonesia –MDTF to support the rehabilitation and reconstruction programme of the GoI) | July 2005 | EUR 50 million (New funds) | 2nd tranche contribution to the MDTF | The transfers of the two tranches represent the EC commitment with the WB in order to keep the EC leading role in the Steering Committee of the Multi-Donors Trust Fund (MDTF).
The MDTF provides the most flexible instrument for support to the reconstruction.
The mobilisation of funds in 2005 will ensure the Commission with an upfront strong position and visibility in the negotiations.

Civil Society organizations representing Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand in a formal United Nations Environment Programme Statement have recommended comprehensive planning for ecological rehabilitation, addressing the need for strengthening environmental defence systems and sustainability in fisheries and in coastal livelihoods.
The Thai government submitted a formal request to the Commission in January 2005 for immediate technical expertise in coastal zone management to assist in the aftermath of the Tsunami.
The Commission proposes to contribute to a regional facility that will be used to respond to coastal management and remediation needs.
Moreover, the facility will support regional measures, which could include technical assistance support to a possible EIB global loan facility in Sri Lanka and support to Early Warning Systems, as well as studies.
Funding needs: Disbursement needed | Amount | Comments | July 2005 | EUR 12 million (New funds) | Contribution to the regional and horizontal facility | 2.
BUDGET LINE AND LEGAL BASE THE COMMISSION WILL USE THE SEPARATE, DEDICATED BUDGET LINE (19 10 04 - REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN ASIA) FOR THE TSUNAMI RESOURCES, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
BOTH OLD AND NEW FUNDS WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THIS LINE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE EUR 12 MILLION RRM ACTIONS AND THE EUR 15 MILLION ASIA PROECO II B.
THE LATTER WAS ALREADY DECIDED ON 16 MARCH 2005, WHEN NO FUNDS WERE YET AVAILABLE ON THE BUDGET LINE 19 10 04.
The current legal base for the budget line 19 10 04 is Council Regulation (EC) No 2258/96 of 22 November 1996 on rehabilitation and reconstruction operations in developing countries (OJ L 306, 28.11.1996, p. 1).
The amending budget therefore complements the existing legal base by Council Regulation (EEC) No 443/92 of 25 February 1992 on financial and technical assistance to, and economic cooperation with, the developing countries in Asia and Latin America (OJ L 52, 27.2.1992, p. 1) to ensure full effectiveness through budget line 19 10 04.

In particular, it will cover the post Tsunami reconstruction aid.” Legal basis to be added: “Council Regulation (EEC) No 443/92 of 25 February 1992 on financial and technical assistance to, and economic cooperation with, the developing countries in Asia and Latin America (OJ L 52, 27.2.1992, p. 1).” 3.
PAYMENT APPROPRIATIONS AND SUPPORT EXPENDITURE It is expected that the 2005 commitments will lead to a high level of disbursements already in 2005.
Indeed, considering the additional payment appropriations allocated by the Budgetary Authority in the 2005 budget compared to the Preliminary Draft General Budget of the European Communities request, all additional needs can be satisfied within the existing allocation in Heading 4.

MODIFICATION OF THE REMARKS OF BUDGET LINE 05 08 03 Within the framework of economic analysis and the development of indicators in the field of agricultural policy, the Commission asked the OECD, beyond the framework of its normal work, to carry out a specific analysis/collection of data for a number of third countries and new Member States.
As far as the legal bases are concerned, it is proposed to add a reference to the Commission’s institutional prerogatives as follows: “Tasks arising from the prerogatives of the Commission at the institutional level, under the terms of Article 49(2)(c), from the regulation (EC, Euratom) nº 1605/2002 of the Council at its meeting on 25 June 2002 on financial regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1).” 6.
EFFECT ON THE HEADING 4 MARGIN The ceiling for Heading 4 in 2005 is already exceeded by EUR 100 million.
The additional recourse to the flexibility instrument for EUR 98 million will result in a negative margin totalling EUR 198 million.
