ANNEX %quot%ANNEX I PART I OF THE REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE(1) I.
The characteristics of the paper document version are specified in Chapter II and those of the smart card version in Chapter III.
The overall dimensions of the Registration Certificate shall not be greater than an A4 format (210 Ă&#x2014; 297 mm) or a folder of A4 format.
The first page of Part I of the Registration Certificate shall contain: - the name of the Member State issuing Part I of the Registration Certificate, - the distinguishing mark of the Member State issuing Part I of the Registration Certificate, namely: B Belgium DK Denmark D Germany GR Greece E Spain F France IRL Ireland I Italy L Luxembourg NL Netherlands A Austria P Portugal FIN Finland S Sweden UK United Kingdom, - the name of the competent authority, - the words %quot%Part I of the Registration Certificate%quot% or, if the certificate consists of one part only, the words %quot%Registration Certificate%quot%, printed in large type in the language or languages of the Member States issuing the Registration Certificate; they shall also appear, after a suitable space, in small type in the other languages of the European Community, - the words %quot%European Community%quot%, printed in the language or languages of the Member State issuing Part I of the Registration Certificate, - the number of the document.
Printed on the front and back of the card shall be at least the data specified in Chapters II.4 and II.5; these data shall be legible with the eye (minimum character height: 6 points) and printed on as follows. (Examples of possible lay-outs are presented in Figure 1 at the end of this section.) A.
The material used for Part I of the Registration Certificate shall be made secure against forgery by using at least three of the following techniques: - microprinting, - guilloche printing*, - iridescent printing, - laser engraving, - ultraviolet fluorescent ink, - inks with viewing angle - dependent colour*, - inks with temperature - dependent colour*, - custom holograms*, - variable laser images, - optical variable images.
The data from the letters A and B is stored in two corresponding files with transparent structure (see ISO/IEC 7816-4).
Thereby card verifiable certificates according to ISO/IEC 7816-8 are exchanged before the authentication process.
These certificates are signed by the national competent authorities and contain an authorisation object (certificate holder authorisation) according to ISO/IEC 7816-9 in order to encode role specific authorisation to the card.
Electronic signatures and the certificates shall be readable without restriction.
The following simplifications are allowed: - NAD Byte: not used (NAD should be set to %quot%00%quot%), - S-Block ABORT: not used, - S-Block VPP state error: not used.
The cards shall be capable of operating correctly in the humidity range 10 % to 90 %.
The access requirements are described in Chapter III.2.
Table 1 %gt%TABLE%gt% III.11.
Data structure The stored certificates are in the X.509v3 format according ISO/IEC 9594-8.
The value fields are coded as ASCII character as defined by ISO/IEC 8824-1, the values %quot%C0%quot%-%quot%FF%quot% are defined by ISO/IEC 8859-1 (Latin1 character set), ISO/IEC 8859-7 (Greek character set) or ISO/IEC 8859-5 (Cyrillic character set).
Unless otherwise stated, the data objects listed in Table 2 are mandatory.

Application selection The application %quot%Vehicle Registration%quot% shall be selectable by a SELECT DF (by name, see ISO/IEC 7816-4) with its application identifier (AID).
Reading data from files The files corresponding to Chapter II, Letters A, B and D, shall be selectable by SELECT (see ISO/IEC 7816-4) with the command parameters P1 set to %quot%02%quot%, P2 set to %quot%04%quot% and the command data field containing the file identifier (see Chapter X, Table 1).
These files shall be readable with READ BINARY (see ISO/IEC 7816-4) with an absent command data field and Le set to the length of the expected data, using a short Le.
ANNEX II PART II OF THE REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE(1) I.
