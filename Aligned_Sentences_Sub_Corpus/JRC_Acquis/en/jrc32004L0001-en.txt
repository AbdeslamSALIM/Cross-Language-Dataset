In evaluating the possible consequences of SEM in baby foods, the expert group reviewed toxicological aspects alongside microbiological and nutritional considerations. (6) On 9 October 2003 they advised that, taking into account the current available information on the levels of SEM in food, intake and toxicology, the risk to both infants and adults eating foods containing SEM was probably very small.
However, the Panel stated that the presence of SEM in baby food was undesirable and recommended that it would be prudent to reduce exposure to SEM as swiftly as technological progress safely allows. (7) Considering the conclusions of the Panel and the ad hoc expert group and the remaining scientific uncertainties it is appropriate, in order to achieve the high level of health protection chosen in the Community, to suspend the use of azodicarbonamide in accordance with the precautionary principle referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3) (Food law).
Member States shall adopt and publish, by 2 August 2005 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
However, materials and articles filled before 2 August 2005 may continue to be placed on the market provided that the date of filling appears on the materials and articles.
Article 3 This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 4 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
