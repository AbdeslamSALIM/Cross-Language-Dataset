Directive 2005/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 September 2005 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the measures to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from compression-ignition engines for use in vehicles, and the emission of gaseous pollutants from positive-ignition engines fuelled with natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas for use in vehicles (Text with EEA relevance) Directive 2005/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 September 2005 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the measures to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from compression-ignition engines for use in vehicles, and the emission of gaseous pollutants from positive-ignition engines fuelled with natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas for use in vehicles (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2], Whereas: (1) Council Directive 88/77/EEC of 3 December 1987 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the measures to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from compression ignition engines for use in vehicles, and the emission of gaseous pollutants from positive ignition engines fuelled with natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas for use in vehicles [3] is one of the separate Directives under the type-approval procedure laid down by Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers [4].
Those autonomous provisions should be fully integrated into the recast of Directive 88/77/EEC in the interests of clarity and legal certainty. (3) It is necessary that all the Member States adopt the same requirements, in order, in particular, to permit the implementation, for each vehicle type, of the EC type-approval system which is the subject of Directive 70/156/EEC. (4) The Commission’s programme on air quality, road transport emissions, fuels and emission abatement technologies, hereinafter "the first Auto-Oil programme", showed that further reductions in pollutant emissions from heavy-duty vehicles were necessary with a view to achieving future air quality standards. (5) Reductions in emission limits applicable from the year 2000, corresponding to abatements of 30 % in emissions of carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter were identified by the first Auto-Oil programme as key measures for the achievement of medium-term air quality.
A reduction of 30 % in exhaust smoke opacity should additionally contribute to the reduction of particulate matter.
The additional limit for oxides of nitrogen applicable in the year 2008 should result in a further 43 % reduction in the emission limit for this pollutant. (6) Type-approval tests for gaseous and particulate pollutants and smoke opacity are applicable to allow for a more representative evaluation of the emissions performance of engines under test conditions that more closely resemble those encountered by vehicles in-service.
The notification of such measures in accordance with this Directive should be without prejudice to the obligation to notify under Article 88(3) of the Treaty. (14) With the aim of simplifying and accelerating the procedure, the Commission should be entrusted with the task of adopting measures implementing the fundamental provisions laid down in this Directive as well as the measures for adapting the annexes of this Directive to scientific and technical progress. (15) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive and its adaptation to scientific and technical progress should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [9]. (16) The Commission should keep under review the need to introduce emission limits for pollutants which are as yet unregulated and which arise as a consequence of the wider use of new alternative fuels and new exhaust emission control systems. (17) The Commission should submit proposals it may deem appropriate for a further stage for limit values for NOx and particulate emissions as soon as possible. (18) Since the objective of this Directive, namely the realisation of the internal market through the introduction of common technical requirements concerning gaseous and particulate emissions for all types of vehicles, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
For types of compression-ignition or gas engines and types of vehicle propelled by compression-ignition or gas engines, where the requirements set out in Annexes I to VIII are not met and in particular where the emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants and opacity of smoke from the engine do not comply with the limit values set out in row A of the tables in Section 6.2.1 of Annex I, Member States: (a) shall refuse to grant EC type-approval pursuant to Article 4(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC; and (b) shall refuse national type-approval. 2.
Except in the case of vehicles and engines intended for export to third countries or replacement engines for in-service vehicles, Member States shall, where the requirements set out in Annexes I to VIII are not met and in particular where the emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants and opacity of smoke from the engine do not comply with the limit values set out in row A of the tables in Section 6.2.1 of Annex I: (a) consider certificates of conformity which accompany new vehicles or new engines pursuant to Directive 70/156/EEC as no longer valid for the purposes of Article 7(1) of that Directive; and (b) prohibit the registration, sale, entry into service or use of new vehicles propelled by a compression-ignition or gas engine and the sale or use of new compression-ignition or gas engines. 3.
If the requirements set out in Annexes I to VIII and in Articles 3 and 4 are satisfied, in particular where the emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants and opacity of smoke from the engine comply with the limit values set out in row B1 or row B2 or with the permissive limit values set out in row C of the tables in Section 6.2.1 of Annex I, no Member State may, on grounds relating to the gaseous and particulate pollutants and opacity of smoke emissions from an engine: (a) refuse to grant EC type-approval pursuant to Article 4(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC or to grant national type-approval for a type of vehicle propelled by a compression-ignition or gas engine; (b) prohibit the registration, sale, entry into service or use of new vehicles propelled by a compression-ignition or gas engine; (c) refuse to grant EC type-approval for a type of compression-ignition or gas engine; (d) prohibit the sale or use of new compression-ignition or gas engines. 5.
In accordance with paragraph 4 an engine that satisfies the requirements set out in Annexes I to VIII, and, in particular, complies with the limit values set out in row C of the tables in Section 6.2.1 of Annex I shall be considered as complying with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.
In accordance with paragraph 4 an engine that satisfies the requirements set out in Annexes I to VIII and in Articles 3 and 4 and, in particular, complies with the limit values set out in row C of the tables in Section 6.2.1 of Annex I shall be considered as complying with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 to 3 and 5 to 8. 10.
The OBD threshold limits shall be as follows: Row | Compression-ignition engines | Mass of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) g/kWh | Mass of particulate (PT) g/kWh | B1 (2005) | 7,0 | 0,1 | B2 (2008) | 7,0 | 0,1 | C (EEV) | 7,0 | 0,1 | 4.
Article 6 Tax incentives 1.
Member States may make provision for tax incentives only in respect of vehicles which comply with this Directive.
The incentives shall apply to all new vehicles offered for sale on the market of a Member State which comply in advance with the limit values set out in row B1 or B2 of the tables in Section 6.2.1 of Annex I.
They shall be terminated with effect from the mandatory application of the limit values in row B1, as laid down in Article 2(6), or from the mandatory application of the limit values in row B2, as laid down in Article 2(8). 3.
The incentives shall apply to all new vehicles offered for sale on the market of a Member State which comply with the permissive limit values set out in row C of the tables in Section 6.2.1 of Annex I. 4.
In addition to the conditions referred to in paragraph 1, for each type of vehicle, the incentives shall not exceed the additional cost of the technical solutions introduced to ensure compliance with the limit values set out in row B1 or row B2 or with the permissive limit values set out in row C of the tables in Section 6.2.1 of Annex I, and of their installation on the vehicle. 5.

In case of an application for EC type-approval for a vehicle type in respect of its engine, the marking specified in Section 5.1.5 shall also be placed close to fuel filling aperture. 5.3.
SPECIFICATIONS AND TESTS 6.1.
For the purposes of point 6.1.2.2, the defined conditions of use under steady state and transient conditions are: - an altitude not exceeding 1000 metres (or equivalent atmospheric pressure of 90 kPa), - an ambient temperature within the range 283 to 303 K (10 to 30 °C), - engine coolant temperature within the range 343 to 368 K (70 to 95 °C). 6.1.3.
Special requirements for electronic emission control systems 6.1.3.1.
The additional material shall also contain a justification for the use of any auxiliary control device and include additional material and test data to demonstrate the effect on exhaust emissions of any auxiliary control device installed to the engine or on the vehicle.
To verify whether any strategy or measure should be considered a defeat device or an irrational emission control strategy according to the definitions given in Sections 2.29 and 2.31, the type-approval authority and/or the technical service may additionally request a NOx screening test using the ETC which may be carried out in combination with either the type-approval test or the procedures for checking the conformity of production. 6.1.4.1.
As an alternative to the requirements of Appendix 4 to Annex III the emissions of NOx during the ETC screening test may be sampled using the raw exhaust gas and the technical prescriptions of ISO DIS 16183, dated 15 October 2000, shall be followed. 6.1.4.2.
In verifying whether any strategy or measure should be considered a defeat device or an irrational emission control strategy according to the definitions given in Sections 2.29 and 2.31, an additional margin of 10 %, related to the appropriate NOx limit value, shall be accepted. 6.1.5.
As an alternative to Sections 6.1.3 and 6.1.4, the manufacturer may present to the technical service the results of a NOx screening test using the ETC on the engine conforming to the characteristics of the parent engine described in Annex II, and taking into account the provisions of Sections 6.1.4.1 and 6.1.4.2.
For type approval testing to either row B1 or B2 or row C of the tables in Section 6.2.1 the emissions shall be determined on the ESC, ELR and ETC tests.
The ESC and ELR test procedures are described in Annex III, Appendix 1, the ETC test procedure in Annex III, Appendices 2 and 3.
The emissions of gaseous pollutants and particulate pollutants, if applicable, and smoke, if applicable, by the engine submitted for testing shall be measured by the methods described in Annex III, Appendix 4.
Annex V describes the recommended analytical systems for the gaseous pollutants, the recommended particulate sampling systems, and the recommended smoke measurement system.
Other systems or analysers may be approved by the Technical Service if it is found that they yield equivalent results on the respective test cycle.
For introduction of a new system into the Directive the determination of equivalency shall be based upon the calculation of repeatability and reproducibility, as described in ISO 5725. 6.2.1.

PRODUCTION CONFORMITY 9.1.
Measures to ensure production conformity must be taken in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of Directive 70/156/EEC.
Sections 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 of Annex X to Directive 70/156/EEC are applicable where the competent authorities are not satisfied with the auditing procedure of the manufacturer. 9.1.1.
Engines that are subject to testing only on the ESC and ELR tests or only on the ETC test for type approval to row A of the tables in Section 6.2.1 are subject to those applicable tests for the checking of production conformity.
The limit values are given in Section 6.2.1 of this Annex. 9.1.1.1.2.
However, at the request of the manufacturer, the tests may be carried out on diesel or gas engines which have been run-in more than the period referred to in Section 9.1.1.2, up to a maximum of 100 hours.
However, at the manufacturer's request, the reference fuels described in Annex IV may be used.
For NG fuelled engines, all these tests may be conducted with commercial fuel in the following way: - for H marked engines with a commercial fuel within the H-range (0,89 ≤ Sλ ≤ 1,00), - for L marked engines with a commercial fuel within the L-range (1,00 ≤ Sλ ≤ 1,19), - for HL marked engines with a commercial fuel within the extreme range of the λ-shift factor (0,89 ≤ Sλ ≤ 1,19).
In the case of dispute caused by the non-compliance of gas fuelled engines when using a commercial fuel, the tests shall be performed with a reference fuel on which the parent engine has been tested, or with the possible additional fuel 3 as referred to in paragraphs 4.1.3.1 and 4.2.1.1 on which the parent engine may have been tested.
Then, the result has to be converted by a calculation applying the relevant factor(s) "r", "ra" or "rb" as described in paragraphs 4.1.4, 4.1.5.1 and 4.2.1.2.
If r, ra or rb are less than 1 no correction shall take place.

With a minimum sample size of three engines the sampling procedure is set so that the probability of a lot passing a test with 40 % of the engines defective is 0,95 (producer's risk = 5 %) while the probability of a lot being accepted with 65 % of the engines defective is 0,10 (consumer's risk = 10 %). 3.
If the natural logarithms of the values measured in the series are χ1, χ2, … χi and L is the natural logarithm of the limit value for the pollutant, then, define di = χi - L and dn‾ = 1nΣi=1ndivn2 = 1nΣi=1ndi - dn‾2 5.
The test statistic result is the ratio: dn‾ / Vn and shall be used to determine whether the series has passed or failed as follows: for m0 ≤ n %lt% m: - pass the series if dn‾ / vn ≤ An, - fail the series if dn‾ / vn ≥ Bn, - take another measurement if An %lt% dn‾ / vn %lt% Bn. 6.
Remarks The following recursive formulae are useful for calculating successive values of the test statistic: dn‾ = 1 - 1n dn-1‾ + 1n dn Vn2 = 1 - 1nVn-12 + dn‾ - dn2n - 1 n = 2, 3, …; d1‾ = d1; V1 = 0 Table 4 Pass and fail decision numbers of Appendix 2 sampling plan Minimum sample size: 3 Cumulative number of engines tested (sample size) | Pass decision number An | Fail decision number Bn | 3 | - 0,80381 | 16,64743 | 4 | - 0,76339 | 7,68627 | 5 | - 0,72982 | 4,67136 | 6 | - 0,69962 | 3,25573 | 7 | - 0,67129 | 2,45431 | 8 | - 0,64406 | 1,94369 | 9 | - 0,61750 | 1,59105 | 10 | - 0,59135 | 1,33295 | 11 | - 0,56542 | 1,13566 | 12 | - 0,53960 | 0,97970 | 13 | - 0,51379 | 0,85307 | 14 | - 0,48791 | 0,74801 | 15 | - 0,46191 | 0,65928 | 16 | - 0,43573 | 0,58321 | 17 | - 0,40933 | 0,51718 | 18 | - 0,38266 | 0,45922 | 19 | - 0,35570 | 0,40788 | 20 | - 0,32840 | 0,36203 | 21 | - 0,30072 | 0,32078 | 22 | - 0,27263 | 0,28343 | 23 | - 0,24410 | 0,24943 | 24 | - 0,21509 | 0,21831 | 25 | - 0,18557 | 0,18970 | 26 | - 0,15550 | 0,16328 | 27 | - 0,12483 | 0,13880 | 28 | - 0,09354 | 0,11603 | 29 | - 0,06159 | 0,09480 | 30 | - 0,02892 | 0,07493 | 31 | - 0,00449 | 0,05629 | 32 | - 0,03876 | 0,03876 | -------------------------------------------------- Appendix 3 PROCEDURE FOR PRODUCTION CONFORMITY TESTING AT MANUFACTURER'S REQUEST 1.
With a minimum sample size of three engines the sampling procedure is set so that the probability of a lot passing a test with 30 % of the engines defective is 0,90 (producer's risk = 10 %) while the probability of a lot being accepted with 65 % of the engines defective is 0,10 (consumer's risk = 10 %). 3.
The following procedure is used for each of the pollutants given in Section 6.2.1 of Annex I (see Figure 2): Let: L = the limit value for the pollutant, xi = the value of the measurement for the i-th engine of the sample, n = the current sample number. 4.
In Table 5 the pass and fail decision numbers are calculated by means of the International Standard ISO 8422/1991.

The filters shall be returned to the weighing chamber and conditioned for at least one hour, but not more than 80 hours, and then weighed.
Since various types of dilution rate control may be used, different calculation methods for GEDFW apply.
Isokinetic systems GEDF W,i = GEXH W,i × qi qi = GDIL W,i + GEXH W,i × rGEXH W,i × r where r corresponds to the ratio of the cross-sectional areas of the isokinetic probe and the exhaust pipe: R = ApAT 5.2.2.
Systems with flow measurement GEDF W,i = GEXH W,i × qi qi = GTOT W,iGTOT W,i - GDIL W,i 5.3.

The response time is defined as the time between when the Bessel output reaches 10 % (t10) and when it reaches 90 % (t90) of this step function.
The first iteration for fc is given by the following formula: fc = π 10 × tF The Bessel constants E and K shall be calculated by the following equations: E = 11 + Ω × 3 × D + D × Ω2 K = 2 × E × D × Ω2 - 1 - 1 where: D = 0,618034 Δt = 1sampling rate Ω = 1tan π × Δt × fc 6.1.2.

The difference in time between t90 and t10 defines the response time tF for that value of fc.

The Bessel algorithm shall then be applied to the instantaneous smoke trace (k-value), as described in Section 6.1.2: Yi = Yi - 1 + E × Si + 2 × Si - 1 + Si - 2 – 4 × Yi - 2 + K × Yi - 1 – Yi - 2 The Bessel algorithm is recursive in nature.

The indicated concentration has to be recorded. 1.7.3.
Calculation The efficiency of the NOx converter is calculated as follows: Efficiency % = 1 + a - bc - d × 100 where, a = is the NOx concentration according to Section 1.7.6 b = is the NOx concentration according to Section 1.7.7 c = is the NO concentration according to Section 1.7.4 d = is the NO concentration according to Section 1.7.5 1.7.4.
Adding of oxygen Via a T-fitting, oxygen or zero air is added continuously to the gas flow until the concentration indicated is about 20 % less than the indicated calibration concentration given in Section 1.7.2. (The analyser is in the NO mode).
The indicated concentration d shall be recorded. (The analyser is in the NO mode). 1.7.6.
NOx mode The NO analyser is then switched to the NOx mode so that the gas mixture (consisting of NO, NO2, O2 and N2) now passes through the converter.
The indicated concentration a shall be recorded. (The analyser is in the NOx mode). 1.7.7.
The indicated concentration b shall be recorded. (The analyser is in the NOx mode). 1.7.8.
The NOx reading of the analyser shall not deviate by more than ± 5 % from the value measured according to Section 1.7.2. (The analyser is in the NO mode). 1.7.9.
Test interval The efficiency of the converter must be tested prior to each calibration of the NOx analyser. 1.7.10.
Note: If, with the analyser in the most common range, the ozonator cannot give a reduction from 80 % to 20 % according to Section 1.7.5, then the highest range which will give the reduction shall be used.
Figure 6 Schematic of NOx converter efficiency device +++++ TIFF +++++ 1.8.
With the fuel and air flow rates set at the manufacturer's recommendations, a 350 ± 75 ppm C span gas shall be introduced to the analyser.
The response at a given fuel flow shall be determined from the difference between the span gas response and the zero gas response.
The fuel flow shall be incrementally adjusted above and below the manufacturer's specification.
Hydrocarbon response factors The analyser shall be calibrated using propane in air and purified synthetic air, according to Section 1.5.
The response factor (Rf) for a particular hydrocarbon species is the ratio of the FID C1 reading to the gas concentration in the cylinder expressed by ppm C1.
The concentration of the test gas must be at a level to give a response of approximately 80 % of full scale.
The concentration must be known to an accuracy of ± 2 % in reference to a gravimetric standard expressed in volume.
In addition, the gas cylinder must be preconditioned for 24 hours at a temperature of 298 K ± 5 K (25 °C ± 5 °C).
The test gases to be used and the recommended relative response factor ranges are as follows: methane and purified synthetic air 1,00 ≤ Rf ≤ 1,15 propylene and purified synthetic air 0,90 ≤ Rf ≤ 1,10 toluene and purified synthetic air 0,90 ≤ Rf ≤ 1,10 These values are relative to the response factor (Rf) of 1,00 for propane and purified synthetic air. 1.8.3.
Oxygen interference check The oxygen interference check shall be determined when introducing an analyser into service and after major service intervals.
The response factor is defined and shall be determined as described in Section 1.8.2.
The test gas to be used and the recommended relative response factor range are as follows: propane and nitrogen 0,95 ≤ Rf ≤ 1,05 This value is relative to the response factor (Rf) of 1,00 for propane and purified synthetic air.
Ideally, the conversion for methane is 0 %, and for the other hydrocarbons represented by ethane is 100 %.
The efficiency shall be determined as follows: CEM = 1 - concw/concw/o where, concw = HC concentration with CH4 flowing through the NMC concw/o = HC concentration with CH4 bypassing the NMC 1.8.4.2.
CO analyser interference check Water and CO2 can interfere with the CO analyser performance.
Therefore, a CO2 span gas having a concentration of 80 to 100 % of full scale of the maximum operating range used during testing shall be bubbled through water at room temperature and the analyser response recorded.
The analyser response must not be more than 1 % of full scale for ranges equal to or above 300 ppm or more than 3 ppm for ranges below 300 ppm. 1.9.2.
NOx analyser quench checks The two gases of concern for CLD (and HCLD) analysers are CO2 and water vapour.
CO2 quench check A CO2 span gas having a concentration of 80 to 100 % of full scale of the maximum operating range shall be passed through the NDIR analyser and the CO2 value recorded as A.
It shall then be diluted approximately 50 % with NO span gas and passed through the NDIR and (H)CLD, with the CO2 and NO values recorded as B and C, respectively.
A NO span gas having a concentration of 80 to 100 % of full scale of the normal operating range shall be passed through the (H)CLD and the NO value recorded as D.

Introduction Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 and Figures 11 to 22 contain detailed descriptions of the recommended dilution and sampling systems.
Other components which are not needed to maintain the accuracy on some systems, may be excluded if their exclusion is based upon good engineering judgement. 2.2.
Partial flow dilution system A dilution system is described in Figures 11 to 19 based upon the dilution of a part of the exhaust stream.
For subsequent collection of the particulates, the entire dilute exhaust gas or only a portion of the dilute exhaust gas is passed to the particulate sampling system (Section 2.4, Figure 21).
Flow controlled systems with concentration measurement (Figures 13 to 17) With these systems, a sample is taken from the bulk exhaust stream by adjusting the dilution air flow and the total dilute exhaust flow.
The concentrations in the dilute exhaust gas and in the dilution air are measured, whereas the concentration in the raw exhaust gas can be either measured directly or determined from fuel flow and the carbon balance equation, if the fuel composition is known.
The systems may be controlled by the calculated dilution ratio (Figures 13, 14) or by the flow into the transfer tube (Figures 12, 13, 14).
Flow controlled systems with flow measurement (Figures 18, 19) With these systems, a sample is taken from the bulk exhaust stream by setting the dilution air flow and the total dilute exhaust flow.
Accurate calibration of the flow meters relative to one another is required, since the relative magnitude of the two flow rates can lead to significant errors at higher dilution ratios (of 15 and above).
Figure 11 Partial flow dilution system with isokinetic probe and fractional sampling (SB control) +++++ TIFF +++++ airsee Figure 21to particulate sampling systemventexhaust Raw exhaust gas is transferred from the exhaust pipe EP to the dilution tunnel DT through the transfer tube TT by the isokinetic sampling probe ISP.
The differential pressure of the exhaust gas between exhaust pipe and inlet to the probe is measured with the pressure transducer DPT.
This signal is transmitted to the flow controller FC1 that controls the suction blower SB to maintain a differential pressure of zero at the tip of the probe.
Under these conditions, exhaust gas velocities in EP and ISP are identical, and the flow through ISP and TT is a constant fraction (split) of the exhaust gas flow.
The split ratio is determined from the cross-sectional areas of EP and ISP.
The dilution air flow rate is measured with the flow measurement device FM1.
The dilution ratio is calculated from the dilution air flow rate and the split ratio.

The differential pressure of the exhaust gas between exhaust pipe and inlet to the probe is measured with the pressure transducer DPT.
Under these conditions, exhaust gas velocities in EP and ISP are identical, and the flow through ISP and TT is a constant fraction (split) of the exhaust gas flow.
The split ratio is determined from the cross sectional areas of EP and ISP.
The dilution ratio is calculated from the dilution air flow rate and the split ratio.
These signals are transmitted to the flow controller FC2 that controls either the pressure blower PB or the suction blower SB to maintain the desired exhaust split and dilution ratio in DT.
The dilution ratio is calculated from the tracer gas concentrations in the raw exhaust gas, the diluted exhaust gas, and the dilution air.

The CO2 and fuel flow GFUEL signals are transmitted either to the flow controller FC2, or to the flow controller FC3 of the particulate sampling system (see Figure 21).
FC2 controls the pressure blower PB, FC3 the sampling pump P (see Figure 21), thereby adjusting the flows into and out of the system so as to maintain the desired exhaust split and dilution ratio in DT.
The dilution ratio is calculated from the CO2 concentrations and GFUEL using the carbon balance assumption.
Figure 15 Partial flow dilution system with single venturi, concentration measurement and fractional sampling +++++ TIFF +++++ airsee Figure 21to particulate sampling systemventexhaust Raw exhaust gas is transferred from the exhaust pipe EP to the dilution tunnel DT through the sampling probe SP and the transfer tube TT due to the negative pressure created by the venturi VN in DT.
The tracer gas concentrations (CO2 or NOx) are measured in the raw exhaust gas, the diluted exhaust gas, and the dilution air with the exhaust gas analyser(s) EGA, and the dilution ratio is calculated from the values so measured.

The first one (FD1) is located in EP, the second one (FD2) in TT.
Additionally, two pressure control valves (PCV1 and PCV2) are necessary to maintain a constant exhaust split by controlling the backpressure in EP and the pressure in DT.
They are necessary for checking the exhaust split, and may be used to adjust PCV1 and PCV2 for precise split control.
The dilution ratio is calculated from the tracer gas concentrations.

The total flow through the tunnel is adjusted with the flow controller FC3 and the sampling pump P of the particulate sampling system (see Figure 18).
The dilution air flow is controlled by the flow controller FC2, which may use GEXHW, GAIRW, or GFUEL as command signals, for the desired exhaust split.
The dilution air flow rate is measured with the flow measurement device FM1, the total flow rate with the flow measurement device FM3 of the particulate sampling system (see Figure 21).
The dilution ratio is calculated from these two flow rates.

GEXHW, GAIRW, or GFUEL may be used as command signals for FC2.
The dilution air flow rate is measured with the flow measurement device FM1, the total flow with the flow measurement device FM2.
The gas velocity at the sampling zone must be higher than 10 m/s except at idle mode.
Pressure oscillations of the exhaust gas must not exceed ± 500 Pa on the average.
For systems without isokinetic probe, it is recommended to have a straight pipe of 6 pipe diameters upstream and 3 pipe diameters downstream of the tip of the probe.
SP Sampling probe (Figures 10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19) The minimum inside diameter shall be 4 mm.
The probe shall be an open tube facing upstream on the exhaust pipe centreline, or a multiple hole probe as described under SP1 in Section 1.2.1, Figure 5.
ISP Isokinetic sampling probe (Figures 11, 12) The isokinetic sampling probe must be installed facing upstream on the exhaust pipe centreline where the flow conditions in section EP are met, and designed to provide a proportional sample of the raw exhaust gas.
The minimum inside diameter shall be 12 mm.
A control system is necessary for isokinetic exhaust splitting by maintaining a differential pressure of zero between EP and ISP.
Under these conditions exhaust gas velocities in EP and ISP are identical and the mass flow through ISP is a constant fraction of the exhaust gas flow.
ISP has to be connected to a differential pressure transducer DPT.
The control to provide a differential pressure of zero between EP and ISP is done with the flow controller FC1.
FD1, FD2 Flow divider (Figure 16) A set of venturis or orifices is installed in the exhaust pipe EP and in the transfer tube TT, respectively, to provide a proportional sample of the raw exhaust gas.
A control system consisting of two pressure control valves PCV1 and PCV2 is necessary for proportional splitting by controlling the pressures in EP and DT.
FD3 Flow divider (Figure 17) A set of tubes (multiple tube unit) is installed in the exhaust pipe EP to provide a proportional sample of the raw exhaust gas.
A control system is necessary for proportional splitting by maintaining a differential pressure of zero between the exit of the multiple tube unit into DC and the exit of TT.
Under these conditions, exhaust gas velocities in EP and FD3 are proportional, and the flow TT is a constant fraction of the exhaust gas flow.
The two points have to be connected to a differential pressure transducer DPT.
EGA Exhaust gas analyser (Figures 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) CO2 or NOx analysers may be used (with carbon balance method CO2 only).
The accuracy of the measuring systems has to be such that the accuracy of GEDFW,i is within ± 4 %.
TT Transfer tube (Figures 11 to 19) The transfer tube shall be: - as short as possible, but not more than 5 m in length, - equal to or greater than the probe diameter, but not more than 25 mm in diameter, - exiting on the centreline of the dilution tunnel and pointing downstream.
If the tube is 1 meter or less in length, it shall be insulated with material with a maximum thermal conductivity of 0,05 W/m*K with a radial insulation thickness corresponding to the diameter of the probe.
If the tube is longer than 1 meter, it must be insulated and heated to a minimum wall temperature of 523 K (250 °C).
DPT Differential pressure transducer (Figures 11, 12, 17) The differential pressure transducer shall have a range of ± 500 Pa or less.
FC1 Flow controller (Figures 11, 12, 17) For isokinetic systems (Figures 11,12), a flow controller is necessary to maintain a differential pressure of zero between EP and ISP.
The adjustment can be done by: (a) controlling the speed or flow of the suction blower SB and keeping the speed or flow of the pressure blower PB constant during each mode (Figure 11); or (b) adjusting the suction blower SB to a constant mass flow of the diluted exhaust gas and controlling the flow of the pressure blower PB, and therefore the exhaust sample flow in a region at the end of the transfer tube TT (Figure 12).
In the case of a pressure controlled system the remaining error in the control loop must not exceed ± 3 Pa.
The pressure oscillations in the dilution tunnel must not exceed ± 250 Pa on the average.
For a multi-tube system (Figure 17), a flow controller is necessary for proportional exhaust splitting to maintain a differential pressure of zero between the exit of the multi-tube unit and the exit of TT.
The adjustment is done by controlling the injection air flow rate into DT at the exit of TT.
PCV1, PCV2 Pressure control valve (Figure 16) Two pressure control valves are necessary for the twin venturi/twin orifice system for proportional flow splitting by controlling the backpressure of EP and the pressure in DT.
The valves shall be located downstream of SP in EP and between PB and DT.
DC Damping chamber (Figure 17) A damping chamber shall be installed at the exit of the multiple tube unit to minimise the pressure oscillations in the exhaust pipe EP.
VN Venturi (Figure 15) A venturi is installed in the dilution tunnel DT to create a negative pressure in the region of the exit of the transfer tube TT.
Since the momentum exchange is affected by the temperature at the exit of TT and the pressure difference between EP and DT, the actual dilution ratio is slightly lower at low load than at high load.
FC2 Flow controller (Figures 13, 14, 18, 19, optional) A flow controller may be used to control the flow of the pressure blower PB and/or the suction blower SB.
FM1 Flow measurement device (Figures 11, 12, 18, 19) Gas meter or other flow instrumentation to measure the dilution air flow.
FM2 Flow measurement device (Figure 19) Gas meter or other flow instrumentation to measure the diluted exhaust gas flow.
FM2 is optional if the suction blower SB is calibrated to measure the flow.
PB Pressures blower (Figures 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19) To control the dilution air flow rate, PB may be connected to the flow controllers FC1 or FC2.
SB may be used to measure the diluted exhaust gas flow, if calibrated.
DT Dilution tunnel (Figures 11 to 19) The dilution tunnel: - shall be of a sufficient length to cause complete mixing of the exhaust and dilution air under turbulent flow conditions; - shall be constructed of stainless steel with: - thickness/diameter ratio of 0,025 or less for dilution tunnels with inside diameters greater than 75 mm; - a nominal thickness of no less then 1,5 mm for dilution tunnels with inside diameters of equal to or less than 75 mm; - shall be at least 75 mm in diameter for the fractional sampling type; - is recommended to be at least 25 mm in diameter for the total sampling type; - may be heated to no greater than 325 K (52 °C) wall temperature by direct heating or by dilution air pre-heating, provided the air temperature does not exceed 325 K (52 °C) prior to the introduction of the exhaust in the dilution tunnel; - may be insulated.
Note: If the ambient temperature in the vicinity of the dilution tunnel (DT) is below 293K (20 °C), precautions should be taken to avoid particle losses onto the cool walls of the dilution tunnel.
HE Heat exchanger (Figures 16, 17) The heat exchanger shall be of sufficient capacity to maintain the temperature at the inlet to the suction blower SB within ± 11K of the average operating temperature observed during the test. 2.3.
Full flow dilution system A dilution system is described in Figure 20 based upon the dilution of the total exhaust using the CVS (Constant Volume Sampling) concept.
For subsequent collection of the particulates, a sample of the dilute exhaust gas is passed to the particulate sampling system (section 2.4, figures 21 and 22).
Figure 20 Full flow dilution system +++++ TIFF +++++ airto background filteroptionaloptionalexhaustsee Figure 21to particulate sampling system or to DDS see Figure 22if EFC is usedventvent The total amount of raw exhaust gas is mixed in the dilution tunnel DT with the dilution air.
The diluted exhaust gas flow rate is measured either with a Positive Displacement Pump PDP or with a Critical Flow Venturi CFV.
If the exhaust pipe downstream of the engine exhaust manifold, turbocharger outlet or aftertreatment device exceeds 4 m in length, then all tubing in excess of 4 m shall be insulated, except for an in-line smokemeter, if used.
The radial thickness of the insulation must be at least 25 mm.
Static exhaust backpressure measured with the PDP system operating shall remain within ± 1,5 kPa of the static pressure measured without connection to the PDP at identical engine speed and load.
The gas mixture temperature immediately ahead of the PDP shall be within ± 6 K of the average operating temperature observed during the test, when no flow compensation is used.
Flow compensation may only be used if the temperature at the inlet to the PDP does not exceed 323K (50 °C).
Static exhaust backpressure measured with the CFV system operating shall remain within ± 1,5 kPa of the static pressure measured without connection to the CFV at identical engine speed and load.

DETERMINATION OF SMOKE 3.1.
Introduction Sections 3.2 and 3.3 and Figures 23 and 24 contain detailed descriptions of the recommended opacimeter systems.
The smoke measurement depends upon the design of the apparatus, and may be done in the exhaust pipe (full flow in-line opacimeter), at the end of the exhaust pipe (full flow end-of-line opacimeter) or by taking a sample from the exhaust pipe (partial flow opacimeter).
Full flow opacimeter Two general types of full flow opacimeters may be used (Figure 23).
With this type of opacimeter, the effective optical path length is a function of the exhaust pipe design and the distance between the end of the exhaust pipe and the opacimeter.
The end of the exhaust pipe shall be cut off squarely.
If the optical path length is not available, it shall be determined in accordance with ISO IDS 11614, Section 11.6.5.
For the correct determination of the optical path length, a minimum exhaust gas velocity of 20 m/s is required.
In the case of an incandescent light source, the receiver shall have a peak spectral response similar to the phototopic curve of the human eye (maximum response) in the range of 550 to 570 nm, to less than 4 % of that maximum response below 430 nm and above 680 nm.

The pressure of the gas in the measuring chamber shall not differ from the atmospheric pressure by more than 0,75 kPa.
The wall temperature of the measuring chamber shall be set to within ± 5 K between 343 K (70 °C) and 373 K (100 °C), but in any case sufficiently above the dew point of the exhaust gas to prevent condensation.
If the optical path length is not available, it shall be determined in accordance with ISO IDS 11614, Section 11.6.5.
In the case of an incandescent light source, the receiver shall have a peak spectral response similar to the phototopic curve of the human eye (maximum response) in the range of 550 to 570 nm, to less than 4 % of that maximum response below 430 nm and above 680 nm.
CL Collimating lens The light output shall be collimated to a beam with a maximum diameter of 30 mm.

To remove these high frequency distortions a Bessel filter is required for the ELR-test.
The goal of applying a Bessel filter is to guarantee a uniform overall filter characteristic of the whole opacimeter system, consisting of: - physical response time of the opacimeter (tp), - electrical response time of the opacimeter (te), - filter response time of the applied Bessel filter (tF).
The resulting overall response time of the system tAver is given by: tAver = tF2 + tp2 + te2 and must be equal for all kinds of opacimeters in order to give the same smoke value.
Therefore, a Bessel filter has to be created in such a way, that the filter response time (tF) together with the physical (tp) and electrical response time (te) of the individual opacimeter must result in the required overall response time (tAver).
Since tp and te are given values for each individual opacimeter, and tAver is defined to be 1,0 s in this Directive, tF can be calculated as follows: tF = tAver2 + tp2 + te2 By definition, the filter response time tF is the rise time of a filtered output signal between 10 % and 90 % on a step input signal.

For determining the times of 10 % (t10) and 90 % (t90) of the output signal, a Bessel filter has to be applied to a step input using the above values of fc, E and K.
The points adjacent to t10 and t90 are marked in bold numbers.
In Table B, first iteration, the 10 % value occurs between index number 30 and 31 and the 90 % value occurs between index number 191 and 192.
