Annex I RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATIONS 1.
CCl4, CFCl3 (CFC-11), CF2Cl2 (CFC-12), C2F3Cl3 (CFC-113), C2F4Cl2 (CFC-114) Fully halogenated alkanes are anthropogenic and act as a source of ClOx, which plays a vital role in ozone photochemistry, especially in the 30 to 50 kilometre altitude region; (ii) Partially halogenated alkanes, e.g.
CH3Cl, CHF2Cl (CFC-22), CH3CCl3, CHFCl2 (CFC-21) The sources of CH3Cl are natural, whereas the other partially halogenated alkanes mentioned above are anthropogenic in origin.
