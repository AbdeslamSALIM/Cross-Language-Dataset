Articles of compatibility groups D or E may be fitted or packed together with their own means of initiation provided that such means have at least two effective protective features designed to prevent an explosion in the event of accidental functioning of the means of initiation.
Such packages shall be assigned to compatibility groups D or E. 3.
Such packages shall be assigned to compatibility groups D or E. 4.
Articles of compatibility groups C, D and E may be packed together.
Such packages shall be assigned to compatibility group E. (8) Articles of compatibility group K, in accordance with paragraph (7), shall not be accepted for carriage. (9) For the purposes of the requirements of this Class and by derogation from marginal 3510 (3), the term 'package` shall also include an unpackaged article in so far as that article is accepted for carriage unpackaged. 2101 (1) The substances and articles of Class 1 to be accepted for carriage are listed in Table 1 below.
General conditions of packing 2102 (1) All explosive substances and articles, as prepared for carriage, shall have been classified in accordance with the procedures detailed in marginal 2100. (2) All packagings for Class 1 goods should be so designed and constructed that: (a) they will protect the explosives, prevent them escaping and cause no increase in the risk of unintended ignition or initiation when subjected to normal conditions of carriage including foreseeable changes in temperature, humidity and pressure; (b) the complete package can be handled safely in normal conditions of transport; and(c) the packages will withstand any loading imposed on them by foreseeable stacking to which they will be subject during transport so that they do not add to the risk presented by the explosives, the containment function of the packagings is not harmed, and they are not distorted in a way or to an extent which will reduce their strength or cause instability of a stack. (3) The packages shall conform to the requirements of Appendices A.5 or A.6, in particular to the requirements for the testing of packagings in Section IV of these appendices, subject to marginals 3500 (12) and 3512 (5). (4) In accordance with the provisions of marginals 2100 (5), 3511 (2) and 3611(2) packagings or IBCs of packing group II marked with the letter 'Y` shall be used for substances and articles of Class 1. (5) The closure device of packagings containing liquid explosives shall ensure a double protection against leakage. (6) The closure device of metal drums shall include a suitable gasket; if a closure device includes a screw-thread, the ingress of explosive substances into the screw-thread shall be prevented. (7) Packagings for water soluble explosives shall be water resistant.
Anti-freeze that could create a fire hazard because of its inherent flammability shall not be used. (9) Nails, staples and other closure devices made of metal without protective covering shall not penetrate to the inside of the outer packaging unless the inner packaging adequately protects the explosives against contact with the metal. (10) Inner packagings, fittings and cushioning materials and the placing of explosive substances or articles in packages shall be accomplished in a manner which prevents the explosive substance from becoming loose in the outer packaging under normal conditions of carriage.
A negative result in Test Series 4 on an unpackaged article indicates that the article can be considered for transport unpackaged.
Such unpackaged articles may be fixed to cradles or contained in crates or other suitable handling devices. (15) Explosive substances shall not be packed in inner or outer packagings where the differences in internal and external pressures, due to thermal or other effects, could cause an explosion or rupture of the package. (16) Whenever loose explosive substances or the explosive substance of an uncased or partly cased article may come into contact with the inner surface of metal packagings (1A2, 1B2, 4A, 4B and metal receptacles), the metal packaging shall be provided with an inner liner or coating [see marginal 3500 (2)]. 2.
Special conditions of packing2103 (1) Substances and articles shall be packed as indicated in marginal 2101, Table 1, columns 4 and 5, and as set out in detail in paragraphs (3), Table 2 and (4), Table 3. (2) Notwithstanding the explosive packing methods required in marginal 2101, Table 1, columns (4) and (5) and in paragraph (3) below, Table 2, EP 01 may be adopted for any explosive substance or article provided the product as packaged has been tested by the competent authority of the country of origin and proved to present no greater hazard than that presented when the product is packed by the method specified in Table 1, column 4.

For shells intended for the carriage of gases of 3°, these blank flanges or other equally reliable devices may be fitted with pressure-release openings of a maximum diameter of 1,5 mm. 212 231 Shells intended for the carriage of liquefied gases may, in addition to openings prescribed in marginals 212 131 and 212 132, be provided with openings for the fitting of gauges, thermometers, manometers and with bleed holes, as required for their operational safety. 212 232 Safety devices shall meet the following requirements: (1) Filling and discharge openings of shells of a capacity exceeding 1 m³ intended for the carriage of liquefied flammable and/or toxic gases shall be equipped with an instant-closing internal safety device which closes automatically in the event of an unintended movement of the tank-container or of fire.
It shall also be possible to operate the closing device by remote control. (2) All openings, other than those accommodating safety valves and than closed bleed holes, of shells intended for the carriage of liquefied flammable and/or toxic gases shall, if their nominal diameter is more than 1,5 mm, be equipped with an internal shut-off device. (3) By derogation from the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2), shells intended for the carriage of deeply refrigerated flammable and/or toxic liquefied gases may be equipped with external devices in place of internal devices if the external devices afford protection against external damage at least equivalent to that afforded by the wall of the shell. (4) If the shells are equipped with gauges, the latter shall not be made of a transparent material in direct contact with the substance carried.
These valves shall be capable of opening automatically under a pressure between 0,9 and 1,0 times the test pressure of the shell to which they are fitted.
Where tank-containers are intended for carriage by sea, the provisions of this paragraph shall not prohibit the fitting of safety valves conforming to the regulations governing that mode of transport (). (2) Shells intended for the carriage of gases of 3° shall be fitted with two independent safety valves; each valve shall be so designed as to allow the gases formed by evaporation during normal operation to escape from the shell in such a way that the pressure does not at any time exceed by more than 10 % the working pressure indicated on the shell.
If the space between the shell and the sheathing is under vacuum (vacuum insulation), the protective sheathing shall be so designed as to withstand without deformation an external pressure of at least 100 kPa (1 bar) (gauge pressure).
The fastening for shells of vacuum insulated tanks may, with the approval of the competent authority, contain plastics substances between the shell and the sheathing. 212 235 (1) A multiple-element tank-container contains elements which are linked to each other by a manifold and mounted on the frame of a multiple-element tank-container.
The following elements are considered to be elements of a multiple-element tank-container: - cylinders as defined in marginal 2211 (1); - tubes as defined in marginal 2211 (2); - pressure drums as defined in marginal 2211 (3); - bundles of cylinders (also known as frames) as defined in marginal 2211 (5); - shells as defined in Annex B.
Each element of a multiple-element tank-container intended for the carriage of gases designated by capital letter F in marginal 2201 when consisting of shells as defined in Annex B shall be capable of being isolated by a shut-off valve. 212 236 By derogation from the provisions of marginal 212 131 shells intended for the carriage of deeply-refrigerated liquefied gases need not have an inspection aperture. 212 237-212 239SECTION 4 TYPE APPROVAL 212 240-212 249 (No special requirements) SECTION 5 TESTS 212 250 (1) Receptacles as defined in marginal 2211 (1), (2) and (3) and cylinders as part of bundles of cylinders as defined in marginal 2211 (5), which are elements of a multiple-element tank-container, shall be tested according to marginal 2219. (2) The materials of every welded shell which do not meet the definition of paragraph (1) shall be tested according to the method described in Appendix B.1d. 212 251 (1) The test pressure for shells intended for the carriage of gases of 1° having a critical temperature below P50° C shall be at least one and one-half times the filling pressure at 15 °C. (2) The test pressure for shells intended for the carriage of: - gases of 1° having a critical temperature of P50 °C or above; and - gases of 2° having a critical temperature below 70 °C - gases of 4° shall be such that, when the shell is filled to the maximum mass of the contents per litre of capacity, the pressure reached in the shell by the substance at 55 °C for shells with thermal insulation or 65 °C for shells without thermal insulation does not exceed the test pressure. (3) The test pressure for shells intended for the carriage of gases of 2° having a critical temperature of 70 °C or above will be: (a) If the shell is equipped with thermal insulation, at least equal to the vapour pressure, reduced by 0,1 MPa (1 bar) of the liquid at 60 °C, but not less than 1 MPa (10 bar); (b) If the shell is not equipped with thermal insulation, at least equal to the vapour pressure, reduced by 0,1 MPa (1 bar), of the liquid at 65 °C, but not less than 1 MPa (10 bar).
The maximum permissible mass of contents per litre of capacity in kg/litre prescribed for the degree of filling is calculated as follows: maximum permissible mass of contents per litre of capacity = 0,95 × density of the liquid phase at 50 °C; moreover the vapour phase shall not disappear below 60 °C.
If the shells are not more than 1,5 metre in diameter the values of the test pressure and maximum permissible mass of contents per litre of capacity conforming to marginal 2219 (d) shall be applicable. (4) The test pressure for shells intended for the carriage of gases of 3° shall be not less than 1,3 times the maximum permitted working pressure indicated on the shell, but not less than 300 kPa (3 bar) (gauge pressure); for shells with vacuum insulation the test pressure shall be not less than 1,3 times the maximum permitted working pressure increased by 100 kPa (1 bar). (5) Table of gases and gas mixtures which may be carried in tank-containers, minimum test pressure of the shells and as far as applicable, maximum mass of contents per litre of capacity.
When shells for gases of 1° or 2° having a critical temperature of P50 °C or above and below 70 °C have been subjected to a test pressure lower than shown in the table, and the shells are fitted with thermal insulation, a lower maximum load may be prescribed by the expert approved by the competent authority, provided that the pressure reached in the shell by the substance at 55 °C does not exceed the test pressure stamped on the shell.
