Article 2 For the purposes of this Directive, %quot%vehicle%quot% means any motor vehicle in category M 1 (defined in Annex I to Directive 70/156/EEC) designed for use on the road, having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h.
Article 3 No Member State may refuse to grant EEC type-approval or national type-approval of a motor vehicle on grounds relating to the anchorages for safety belts if these anchorages comply with the requirements laid down in Annexes I, III and IV.
Article 6 Any amendments necessary to adjust the requirements of the Annexes to take account of technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Directive 70/156/EEC.
Article 8 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Points L1 and L2 are the lower effective belt anchorages. 4.1.4.
Point C is a point situated 450 mm vertically above point H. 4.1.5.
S is the distance in millimetres of the effective upper belt anchorage from a reference plane P parallel to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle defined as follows: 4.1.6.1.
the plane P for the driver shall be a vertical plane parallel to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle and passing through the centre of the steering wheel in its mean position, if adjustable; 4.1.6.2.2.
plane P for the rear outboard seating position shall be that specified by the manufacturer on condition that the following limits for distance A between the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle and plane P are respected: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0009145%quot%%gt% 4.2.
For front seats, two lower belt anchorages and one upper belt anchorage shall be provided. 4.3.1.1.
The belt anchorages for any one belt may be located wholly in the vehicle structure, the seat structure or any other part of the vehicle or may be dispersed between these locations. 4.4.2.2.
The distance between the two vertical planes parallel to the median longitudinal plane of the seat and each passing through a different one of two effective lower anchorages L1 and L2 of the same seat belt shall not be less than 350 mm.
The median longitudinal plane of the seat shall pass between points L1 and L2 and shall be at least 120 mm from those points. 4.4.4.
In the case where a strap guide or similar device is used which affects the location of the effective upper belt anchorage, this location will be determined in a conventional way by considering the position of the anchorage when the longitudinal centre line of the strap passes through a point J defined successively from point H by the following three segments: HZ, which is a segment of the reference line measured in an upward direction from point H and 530 mm long; ZX, which is a segment perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle, measured from point Z in the direction of the anchorage and 120 mm long; XJ, which is a segment perpendicular to the plane defined by segments HZ and ZX, measured in a forward direction from point X and 60 mm long. 4.4.4.2.
If located to the rear of a plane perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the seat and passing through the reference line, the effective upper belt anchorage shall lie below the plane FN perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the seat and forming an angle of 65º to the reference line.
The plane FN is so positioned that it intersects the reference line at a point D such that DH equals 315 mm + 1 76 S.
If located on or forward of a plane perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the seat and passing through the reference line, the effective upper belt anchorage shall be below the plane F1N1 perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the seat and forming an angle of 65º to the reference line.
The plane F1N1 is so positioned that it intersects the reference line at a point D' such that D'H equals 315 mm + 1 78 S. 4.4.4.3.
If located to the rear of a plane perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the seat and passing through the reference line, the effective upper belt anchorage shall lie behind a plane FK, perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the seat, intersecting the reference line at an angle of 120º at a point B such that BH equals 260 mm + 1 72 S.
If located on or forward of a plane perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the seat and passing through the reference line, the effective upper belt anchorage shall lie behind a plane F1K1 perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the seat, intersecting the reference line at an angle of 120º at a point B' such that B'H equals 260 mm + S. 4.4.4.4.
The value of S shall not be less than 140 mm. 4.4.4.5.
The effective upper belt anchorage shall be situated to the rear of a vertical plane perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle and passing through the H point as shown in Annex III. 4.4.4.6.
The effective upper belt anchorage shall be situated above the horizontal plane passing through point C. 4.4.4.7.
By way of derogation from the requirement of point 4.4.4.6 and until 1 January 1979, the effective upper belt anchorage may be placed in the area included between horizontal plane CY and plane CM perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle and forming a 20 degree angle with plane CY where the configuration of the vehicle does not allow the location of this anchorage above the plane CY.
A belt anchorage shall have a threaded hole of 11 711 mm (7/16) 20 UNF 2B. 5.
A securing device shall be regarded as satisfactory if it produces no effect on an area extending over the whole width of the structure and if the vehicle or the structure is blocked or fixed in front at a distance of not less than 500 mm from the belt anchorage to be tested and is held or fixed at the rear not less than 300 mm from that anchorage. 5.2.3.
The tractive force shall be applied in a forward direction at an angle of 10º ± 5º above the horizontal in a plane parallel to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle. 5.3.3.
The belt anchorages must withstand the specified load for not less than 0 72 second. 5.3.4.
The belt anchorages for seats for which upper belt anchorages are provided shall be tested under the following conditions: 5.3.5.1.
Front outboard seats: The belt anchorages shall be submitted to the test prescribed in point 5.4.1 in which the loads are transmitted to them by means of a device reproducing the geometry of a three-point safety belt equipped with a retractor having a pulley or strap guide at the upper belt anchorage. 5.3.5.1.1.
Rear outboard seats and all centre seats: The belt anchorages shall be subjected to the test prescribed in point 5.4.2, in which the loads are transmitted to them by means of a device reproducing the geometry of a three-point safety belt without a retractor, and to the test prescribed in point 5.4.3, in which the loads are transmitted to the two lower belt anchorages by means of a device reproducing the geometry of a lap belt.
If no upper belt anchorages are provided for the rear outboard seats and the centre seats, the lower belt anchorages shall be submitted to the test prescribed in point 5.4.3, in which the loads are transmitted to these anchorages by means of a device reproducing the geometry of a lap belt. 5.3.7.
A test load of 1 350 daN ± 20 daN shall be applied to a traction device (see Annex IV, figure 2) attached to the belt anchorages of the same belt by means of a device reproducing the geometry of the upper torso strap of such a safety belt. 5.4.1.3.
At the same time a tractive force of 1 350 daN ± 20 daN shall be applied to a traction device (see Annex IV, figure 1) attached to the two lower belt anchorages. 5.4.2.
A test load of 1 350 daN ± 20 daN shall be applied to a traction device (see Annex IV, figure 2) attached to the upper belt anchorage and to the opposite lower belt anchorage of the same belt, using, if supplied by the manufacturer, a retractor fixed at the upper belt anchorage. 5.4.2.2.
At the same time a tractive force of 1 350 daN ± 20 daN shall be applied to a traction device (see Annex IV, figure 1) attached to the lower belt anchorages. 5.4.3.
Test in configuration of a lap belt A test load of 2 225 daN ± 20 daN shall be applied to a traction device (see Annex IV, figure 1) attached to the two lower belt anchorages. 5.4.4.
The loads indicated in points 5.4.1, 5.4.2 and 5.4.3 shall be supplemented by a force equal to 20 times the weight of the complete seat applied horizontally and longitudinally through the centre of gravity of the seat. 5.5.
During the test, the minimum spacings for the effective lower belt anchorages specified in point 4.4.3.3 and the requirements of points 4.4.4.6 and 4.4.4.7 for effective upper belt anchorages shall be respected. 5.5.2.
