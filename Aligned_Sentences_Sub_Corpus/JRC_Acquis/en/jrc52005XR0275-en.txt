Urges the European Commission, in consequence, to promote a more proactive role for the Committee before action is taken at Community level by means of outlook opinions on future Community policies focusing on their impact on local and regional authorities, as well as through impact reports on certain directives from a local and regional perspective.
Furthermore supports the idea that competitiveness depends on a functioning single market, and insists that in particular attention is needed in cross-border regions.
Reaffirms the need to safeguard a form of agriculture which is multifunctional in all the regions of Europe, since the countryside covers 90 % of Community territory, and welcomes the continuing reform of the CAP in those sectors which have not yet been reformed; recalls, in this regard, that the opportunity presented by the review of Community measures should therefore be used to seek new provisions to compensate for natural disadvantages facing farms in particular, but also measures to encourage the management of large areas and, more generally, their economic development.
In this context, in 2006, it will consider with particular interest the communication on the social sector of the services of general interest.
Welcomes the proposal to hold a year of intercultural dialogue 2008 and reiterates that for the CoR, respect of cultural and linguistic diversity is one of the basic principles underlying the process of European integration which is not about levelling out differences or creating uniform identities but fostering greater cooperation and understanding among the peoples of Europe.
