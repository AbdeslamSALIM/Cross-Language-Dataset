Commission Regulation (EC) No%nbsp%862/2005 of 7 June 2005 imposing provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of granular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) originating in Russia and the People's Republic of China Commission Regulation (EC) No 862/2005 of 7 June 2005 imposing provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of granular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) originating in Russia and the People's Republic of China THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [1] (basic Regulation), and in particular Article 7 thereof, After consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: A.
Initiation (1) On 9 September 2004, the Commission announced by a notice (notice of initiation) published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2], the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding with regard to imports into the Community of granular polytetrafluoroethylene resin (PTFE) originating in Russia and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). (2) The anti-dumping proceeding was initiated following a complaint lodged on 26 July 2004 by the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC or the complainant) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 80 %, of the total Community production of PTFE.
Parties concerned by the proceeding (3) The Commission officially advised the exporting producers in Russia and in the PRC, importers/traders and their associations, suppliers and users known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting countries concerned and the complainant and all known Community producers of the initiation of the proceeding.
Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation. (4) In view of the apparent large number of Chinese exporting producers listed in the complaint, sampling was envisaged in the notice of initiation for the determination of dumping, in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. (5) In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling would be necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all exporting producers from the PRC were asked to make themselves known to the Commission and to provide, as specified in the notice of initiation, basic information on their activities related to PTFE during the investigation period ( 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004). (6) After examination of the information submitted by exporting producers and due to the low number of replies to the sampling questions, it was decided that sampling was not necessary with regard to the exporters in the PRC. (7) In order to allow exporting producers in the PRC to submit a claim for market economy treatment (MET) or individual treatment (IT), if they so wished, the Commission sent claim forms to the Chinese exporting producers known to be concerned.
Claims for MET, or for IT in case the investigation establishes that they do not meet the conditions for MET, were received from three exporting producers. (8) The Commission sent questionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to all the other companies that made themselves known within the deadlines set out in the notice of initiation.
Ltd. (d) Exporting producers in Russia: - Kirovo-Chepetsky Khimichesky Kombinat and its related company Priborlab Ltd, - Open Joint Stock Company "Halogen". (e) Related importers - Chemical Goods Ltd, United Kingdom. (10) In view of the need to establish a normal value for exporting producers in the PRC to which MET might not be granted, a verification visit to establish normal value on the basis of data from an analogue country, the United States of America (USA), took place at the premises of the following companies: - AGC Chemicals Americas, Inc., USA, - E.
DuPont de Nemours %amp% Company, Inc., USA. 3.
Investigation period (11) The investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 (investigation period or IP).
The examination of trends in the context of the injury analysis covered the period from 1 January 2001 to the end of the IP (period under consideration or period considered).
The most known trade mark under which this product is commercialised is Teflon. 2.
Product concerned (14) The product concerned is so called granular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), containing not more than 3 % of other monomer unit than tetrafluoroethylene, without fillers, in the form of powder or pellets, with the exclusion of micronised materials, and its raw polymer (reactor bead).
The product concerned is currently classifiable within CN code ex39046100. 3.
They are therefore provisionally considered to be alike within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation. (16) The two importers claimed that for certain applications, the product imported from Russia and China is not in competition at all with the PTFE produced and sold in the Community market.
With regard to the examination on a product type basis, the Commission considered as identical or directly comparable the product types sold domestically and exported, which were of similar average particle size, thermo treatment and co-monomer content. (20) For each type sold by the exporting producers on their domestic markets and found to be directly comparable with the type of PTFE sold for export to the Community, it was established whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation.
Since the sales volume of each PTFE type, sold at a net sales price equal to or above the calculated cost of production, represented more than 80 % of the total sales volume of that type, and the weighted average price of that type was equal to or above the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of the prices of all domestic sales of that type made during the IP, irrespective of whether these sales were profitable or not. 1.2.
Export price (22) In all cases the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the Basic Regulation, namely on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable. 1.3.
Dumping margin (24) According to Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation the dumping margin for each exporting producer was established on the basis of a comparison between the weighted average normal value with the weighted average export price per product type. 1.5.
Company | Criteria | Article 2(7)(c)indent 1 | Article 2(7)(c)indent 2 | Article 2(7)(c)indent 3 | Article 2(7)(c)indent 4 | Article 2(7)(c)indent 5 | 1 | Not met | Not met | Not met | Met | Met | 2 | Not met | Not met | Not met | Met | Met | 3 | Not met | Not met | Not met | Not met | Met | (29) The companies concerned were given an opportunity to comment on the above findings.
It was further argued that the Commission based its decisions on indications and presumptions, and that Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation was not applied in an objective way. (31) In this respect it should be noted that the current investigation, including the assessment of whether an exporting producer operates under market economy conditions, is made in accordance with the applicable provisions of the basic Regulation, which are fully in line with WTO obligations. (32) As acknowledged by the Court of First Instance, the burden of proof is on the exporting producer to demonstrate that it fulfils the conditions laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation.
In this respect, it is recalled that, in accordance with a consistent Commission practice, where the State has the possibility to exert significant influence on the company’s decisions, whether legally or de facto, it is considered that the first criterion of Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation is not met.
However, it was found that this company faced significant financial difficulties having been loss-making for a number of consecutive years, and was bailed out by its State-owned shareholder.
Although, as argued by the company, such significant financial difficulties may not necessarily result in bankruptcy, the fact that the State-owned shareholder rescued the company (including through debt write-off), in a situation where under normal market conditions a shareholder would not have done this, indicates that the application of such law to this particular case is doubtful.
It had therefore to be concluded that there was no evidence that the bankruptcy law applied in practice to the company.
Individual Treatment (IT) (41) Further to Article 2(7)(a) of the Basic Regulation, a countrywide duty, if any, is established for countries falling under Article 2(7) of the Basic Regulation, except in those cases where companies are able to demonstrate that they meet all criteria set out in Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation for receiving individual treatment. (42) The three exporting producers, as well as requesting MET, also claimed individual treatment in the event of not being granted MET. (43) Since none of the three companies was able to demonstrate that State interference, whether actual or potential, was not such as to also influence their export prices and quantities, as well as their conditions and terms of the sales, it had to be concluded that they did not meet the conditions set in Article 9(5)(b) of the basic Regulation. (44) Equally, for all three companies it was found that the risk of circumvention of the measures could not be excluded, if these exporters were to be given an individual duty rate.
Therefore, the conditions set in Article 9(5)(e) of the basic Regulation were not met. (45) Since none of the companies meets all the criteria set out in Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation, it is provisionally decided not to grant them IT. 1.5.3.
Normal value 1.5.3.1.
Consequently, the use of such data for the determination of normal value for Chinese exporting producers not granted market economy treatment could not be accepted.
The USA has a large and highly competitive market for the product concerned, with three producers and, despite anti-dumping duties, significant imports (above 20 % of the domestic market) including from the PRC and Russia.
It was found however, that fluorspar is the fourth upstream raw material of PTFE and should therefore represent only a very small part of its cost of manufacturing (roughly estimated at less than 5 %).
Export price (59) All export sales to the Community by the Chinese exporting producers were made directly to independent customers in the Community and therefore, the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the Basic Regulation on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable. 1.5.5.
Comparison (60) Adjustments were made in respect of discounts and rebates, commissions, transport, insurance, packing, credit costs, after sales costs and bank charges where applicable and justified. (61) As mentioned in recital 53 an adjustment pursuant to Article 2(10)(a) of the basic Regulation was made to the normal value for differences in degrees of contamination between the product sold by the Chinese producers to the Community and that sold in the domestic market in the USA. (62) Furthermore, one product type exported by the Chinese exporting producers had a different thermo treatment when compared to the comparable type sold in the analogue country.
In the absence of any more reliable information, the adjustment was established on the basis of the price difference related to that specific characteristic found in the analogue country. (63) For one product type exported by the Chinese producers, with an average particle size between 100 microns and 400 micros, no direct matching product type was produced during the IP by the cooperating producers in the USA, and no estimation of the market difference could be established.
Nevertheless, on the basis of the information provided by one producer in the USA, it was provisionally concluded that this product type sold by the Chinese exporters, with inconsistent particle sizes, had characteristics closely resembling those of low flow PTFE (or less than 100 micron).
It was therefore considered appropriate to provisionally base the normal value of that type on the normal value found for low flow PTFE sold in the USA market. (64) An adjustment was also made with regard to claimed differences in Chinese VAT reimbursement. 1.5.6.
Dumping margin (65) For each Chinese exporting producer, the weighted average normal value for the types exported to the Community established for the analogue country was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type exported to the Community, as provided for under Article 2(11) of the Basic Regulation. (66) As explained in recitals 41 to 43, none of the three cooperating Chinese companies was granted IT.
Consequently, a single countrywide dumping margin was established on the basis of the weighted average of the dumping margins found for each of the three Chinese producers. (67) The countrywide dumping margin expressed as a percentage of the CIF net free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, is 99,7 %. (68) Since the three known exporting producers appeared to account for all Chinese exports of the product concerned to the Community, there was no reason to believe that any exporting producer abstained from cooperating.
Russia (69) Questionnaire replies were received from the two known exporting producers and from the related companies of one of the exporters (one trader in Russia and one importer in the Community). 1.6.1.
Furthermore, in both cases, the on-the-spot verification showed that these companies had submitted incomplete, incorrect and misleading information. (71) Thus, in one of the companies, the accounting had significant shortcomings and was found to be unreliable.
Finally, the related trader in the United Kingdom could not provide any financial figure for the IP. (75) In view of the above, it was considered that the dumping margins for both exporting producers could not be established on the basis of their own data.
The dumping margin was therefore provisionally determined on the basis of facts available, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation. 1.6.2.
Normal value (76) In the absence of any other information, the normal value was provisionally calculated on the basis of the information in the complaint.
Export price (77) Export price was provisionally calculated on the basis of Eurostat data for the IP. 1.6.4.
Dumping margin (80) The provisional dumping margin was established on the basis of a comparison of the weighted average normal value with the weighted average export price, as determined above. (81) The comparison between the normal value and the export price showed the existence of dumping.
The provisional dumping margins, expressed as a percentage of the cif net free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, is 36,6 %. (82) Since the aforementioned two companies represented all export sales from Russia to the Community, and since there was no reason to believe that any exporting producer abstained from cooperating, the residual duty was also set at the same level.
Neither of these two producers opposed the present proceeding. (84) The Commission has found that all the above companies could be considered as Community producers within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the basic Regulation.
The output of all the above companies constitutes the Community production, established by adding to the volume of production reported by the three producers supporting the complaint, the estimated production of the two non-complaining producers, as contained in the complaint. 2.
Community industry (85) The accumulated production of the three Community producers which cooperated with the Commission represents 81 % of the total production of granular PTFE resin in the Community.
Community consumption (86) Community consumption was established on the basis of the sales volumes of the Community industry on the Community market, plus the estimated sales of the other Community producers, plus the imports from Russia, the PRC and the other third countries under CN code ex39046100.
It is noted that imports from Russia under CN code 39046100 cover the product concerned and other products.
The total import volume from Russia of PTFE was therefore estimated based on the methodology followed in the complaint.
It was also found that export prices from Russia and China had a similar trend during the period considered and both were significantly undercutting the Community prices. (91) The Russian exporting producers argued that PTFE imported from Russia on the one hand and the one imported from the PRC on the other hand were subject to different conditions of competition and that imports originating in Russia should therefore be decumulated.
Finally, it should be noted that the Community industry sales were also concentrated mainly in Italy and therefore in direct competition with the imports originating in Russia and the PRC.
Imports from the countries concerned 5.1.
Volume and market share of the imports concerned (94) Although imports of the product concerned from Russia and the PRC into the Community decreased from 6281 tonnes in 2001 to 4838 tonnes in 2002, they increased since 2002 and reached 5079 tonnes in the IP. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Imports from Russia and the PRC (tonnes) | 6281 | 4838 | 5069 | 5079 | Index (2001 = 100) | 100 | 77 | 81 | 81 | (95) The corresponding market share decreased from 38,8 % in 2001 to 34,5 % in the IP, but remained very significant.
It is noted that the market share has shown a continuous gradual increase since 2002, i.e.
Thus, they shrank from EUR 7236/tonne in 2001 to EUR 4092/tonne in the IP, i.e.
A number of parties estimated the adjustment at 30 %, based on the alleged price difference between the different qualities.
On this basis, and given that no other more reliable information was available in this regard, an adjustment of 30 % was provisionally added to the CIF Community frontier price of the cooperating exporting producers from both countries.
It is noted that this issue will be further investigated in order to reach definitive conclusions. (99) A comparison showed that the products concerned originating in the PRC and Russia were sold in the Community at prices which undercut the Community industry's prices by 24 % and 17 % respectively during the IP when expressed as a percentage of the Community industry's prices. 6.
Situation of the Community industry (100) In accordance with Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation, the examination of the impact of the dumped imports on the Community industry included an evaluation of all economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the Community industry from 2001 to the IP. 6.1.
Production, capacity and capacity utilisation (101) The production volume of the Community industry increased by 8 % between 2001 and the IP, from 6798 tonnes to 7326 tonnes.
Despite a fall in Community consumption during the same period, it should be noted that the Community industry had to decrease its sales prices as a consequence of the dumped imports in order to compete with the imports under consideration.
This lead to an increase in production to cater for the increased demand for its products. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Production (tonnes) | 6798 | 5885 | 7066 | 7326 | Index (2001 = 100) | 100 | 87 | 104 | 108 | (102) The production capacity slightly increased, by 8 % over the period considered.
During the same period, the capacity utilisation of the Community industry remained stable at 80 %.
Subsequently, as stated above, the Community industry had to lower its prices, thereby increasing its sales, in order to compete with the imports of the countries concerned whose prices had fallen by almost 40 % in 2004 (see recital 96).
Thus, capacity utilisation of the Community industry recovered, while profitability went down dramatically (see recital 110w). | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Production capacity (tonnes) | 8480 | 9050 | 9100 | 9200 | Index (2001 = 100) | 100 | 107 | 107 | 108 | Capacity utilisation | 80 % | 65 % | 78 % | 80 % | 6.2.
Sales volume and market share (103) Over the period under consideration, the EC sales volume of the Community industry increased by 15 %, from 4223 tonnes in 2001 to 4845 tonnes during the IP.
All Community producers lowered their sales prices as from 2001 in an effort to maintain or even increase their volume of sales in order to reach the critical mass of production needed to cover their fixed costs. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | EC sales (tonnes) | 4223 | 4058 | 4522 | 4845 | Index (2001 = 100) | 100 | 96 | 107 | 115 | (104) The Community industry’s market share increased in volume from 26,1 % in 2001 to 32,9 % in the IP. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | EC market share | 26,1 % | 28,4 % | 30,7 % | 32,9 % | 6.3.
It is also noted that stocks were at levels considered normal in this industry. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Stock (tonnes) | 1232 | 1078 | 1361 | 1145 | Index (2001 = 100) | 100 | 87 | 110 | 93 | 6.4.
Prices and factors affecting domestic prices (106) Average prices per tonne of the Community industry have dropped significantly between 2001 and the IP, by 22 %.
It is noted that the price decline of Russian and Chinese imports was even considerably higher than that of the Community industry. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Average selling price (EUR/tonnes) | 9521 | 9182 | 7649 | 7431 | Index (2001 = 100) | 100 | 96 | 80 | 78 | 6.5.
Growth (107) While Community consumption declined by 9 % between 2001 and the IP, the market share of the Community industry grew by 6,8 percentage points from 26,1 % in 2001 to 32,9 % in the IP. 6.6.
After 2001, investments decreased sharply and then further decreased from EUR 4,7 million in 2002 to EUR 3,4 million in the IP. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Investments (in EUR 1000) | 8331 | 4730 | 3833 | 3387 | Index (2001 = 100) | 100 | 57 | 46 | 41 | (109) As to ability to raise capital, all of the cooperating Community producers are part of larger groups and are financed via intra group cash pooling systems.
Profitability, return on investment and cash flow (110) Over the period under consideration, the profitability of the Community producers dropped significantly from 9,3 % in 2001 to 0,1 % in the IP.
The return on investment followed a similar downward trend as that seen for profitability.
Employment and productivity (112) Employment decreased by 10 % between 2001 and the IP.
Productivity increased between 2001 and the IP, by 17 %, due to the important measures put into place to improve cost efficiency, such as the reduction of personnel and removal of bottlenecks in production. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Employment | 123 | 111 | 117 | 111 | Index (2001 = 100) | 100 | 90 | 95 | 90 | Production per employee (tonnes/employee) | 55 | 53 | 61 | 66 | Index (2001 = 100) | 100 | 96 | 110 | 119 | 6.9.
Wages (113) Labour costs increased by 6 % over the period under consideration, from EUR 6,2 million in 2001 to EUR 6,5 million during the IP.
Due to the reduction in the number of people employed, average labour costs per employee actually increased by 17 %, from EUR 50239 to EUR 58842. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Labour costs per employee (EUR) | 50239 | 55538 | 57920 | 58842 | Index (2001 = 100) | 100 | 111 | 115 | 117 | 6.10.
Conclusion on injury (116) Although the volume of dumped imports of the product concerned originating in Russia and the PRC decreased from 6281 tonnes to 5079 tonnes between 2001 and the IP, it remained constantly high during the whole period considered.
The corresponding market share decreased from 38,8 % in 2001 to 34,5 % during the IP but remained also at a very high level.
As explained in recitals 101, 102 and 103 above, the Community industry’s increase in production and sales volume as well as market share has to be seen in the context of the significant price decline in the Community and the Community industry’s consequent decision to lower its sales prices to thus maintain or increase its sales volume and to reach the critical mass of production volume needed to cover fixed costs.
This had a dramatic impact on the Community industry’s profitability which declined substantially from 9,3 % in 2001 to 0,1 % in the IP and with substantial losses in 2003 (– 3,2 %).
It should furthermore be noted that consumption only decreased between 2001 and 2002, but remained stable between 2002 and the IP, or even increased slightly.
The increase in sales volume and market share was therefore not considered as decisive for the assessment of the Community industry’s situation during the period considered. (120) In the light of the foregoing, it is provisionally concluded that the Community industry suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation.
Introduction (121) In accordance with Article 3(6) and (7) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether the dumped imports originating in Russia and the PRC have caused injury to the Community industry to a degree that may be considered as material.
Effect of the dumped imports (122) It has to be noted that although imports from Russia and China decreased overall between 2001 and the IP, they showed an increasing trend since 2002.
Thus, imports fell from 2001 to 2002 from 6281 tonnes to 4838 tonnes.
Between 2002 and the IP, however, the volume of imports of the product concerned from Russia and the PRC into the Community increased from 4838 tonnes to 5079 tonnes.
As mentioned above, the imports originating in Russia and the PRC undercut the average sales price of the Community industry by significant amounts, with undercutting margins of 17,4 % and 24,5 %. (124) In the analysis of the effect of the dumped imports, it was found that price is an important element of competition.
However, in those instances of the market where this same producer was exposed to competition from the dumped imports from Russia and the PRC, its financial situation was significantly negative. (126) It is therefore provisionally concluded that the pressure exerted by the imports concerned, which increased their volume and market share from 2002 onwards, and which were made at very low and dumped prices, played a determining role in the deterioration of the Community industry’s financial situation. 3.
This drop in consumption is, however, not in line with the decrease of the total Community market value, which fell by 39 % during the same period, i.e.
It is noted that the overall decrease of the Community consumption did not prevent the Community industry to increase its sales volume (by 15 % over the period considered), while the increase in sales volume was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in sales value which caused significant financial losses to the Community industry.
This shows that the material injury suffered by the Community industry is rather a consequence of the decline in sales value than the fall in consumption. (128) As mentioned in recital 87, the reason for the decline in the Community consumption was the general economic downturn worldwide.
Thus, consumption fell by 9 %, while import prices declined by 43 % during the period under consideration.
Given this sharp and constant price decline, whereas consumption although decreasing between 2001 and 2002 remained relatively stable subsequently, it was concluded that the material injury suffered is not caused by a decrease in consumption but rather by the dumped imports from the countries concerned which as a consequence forced the Community industry to lower its sales prices. 3.2.
Imports originating in third countries other than Russia and the PRC (130) It should be recalled that the product concerned forms only a part of CN code 39046100.
Imports originating in third countries other than Russia and the PRC decreased slightly, from 4270 tonnes in 2001 to 3699 tonnes during the IP.
Consequently, their market share decreased overall from 26,4 % in 2001 to 25,1 % in the IP.
Throughout this period, prices of imports from other countries were nearly 50 % higher than the prices of imports from Russia and the PRC.
Consequently, imports from other third countries did not exert a competitive pressure on the Community industry to the extent that imports from Russia and the PRC did. (132) It is therefore provisionally concluded that imports from other third countries could not be a determining reason for the injurious situation of the Community industry. 3.3.
Performance of non-complainant Community producers (other Community producers) (133) Two Community producers, representing approximately 19 % of the total Community production, did not expressively oppose or support the complaint.
As regards the sales volume of other Community producers, it declined from an estimated 1411 tonnes in 2001 to 1102 tonnes in the IP.
Their share of the Community market fell from 25 % to 19 % over the same period.
Therefore, it is provisionally concluded that the products produced and sold by the other Community producers did not contribute to the material injury suffered by the Community industry. 3.4.
Exports by the Community industry (134) Exports of PTFE by the Community industry outside the Community were slightly increasing during the period considered (by 3 %) and represented 12,7 % of the Community industry’s total sales during the IP.
Thus, production costs of the Community industry decreased constantly over the period considered and fell by 13 % between 2001 and the IP.
Conclusion (136) The substantial market share of the imports originating in Russia and the PRC, as well as the considerable decrease in their sales prices and the level of price undercutting found during the IP coincided with the material injury suffered by the Community industry. (137) The development of the Community consumption, imports from other third countries, exports of the Community industry, the performance of other Community producers and the development of costs were analysed but found not to be a determining reason for the injury suffered by the Community industry. (138) Based on the above analysis, which has properly distinguished and separated the effects of all known factors having an effect on the situation of the Community industry from the injurious effect of the dumped imports, it is therefore provisionally concluded that the imports from Russia and the PRC have caused material injury to the Community within the meaning of Article 3(6) of the basic Regulation.
COMMUNITY INTEREST (139) In accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether, despite the conclusion on injurious dumping, compelling reasons existed for concluding that it is not in the Community interest to adopt measures in this particular case.
Interest of unrelated importers/traders and users in the Community (144) The Commission sent questionnaires to all known importers/traders.
Only two importers/traders, representing almost 30 % of total imports from Russia and the PRC, replied to the questionnaire.
The Commission also sent questionnaires to all known users in the Community (a total of nine) and received three (partial) replies to the questionnaire.
The users represented only 14 % of Community consumption. (145) PTFE is used as a component in a wide number of industrial sectors including chemical, mechanical, electrical (inner shield of cables), automotive, construction (as isolation agent), cookware (pans), textile, biomedical (surgery instruments), semi-conductors, and aerospace.
The most known trade mark under which this product is commercialised is Teflon. (146) The cooperating users were producers of semi-finished products which were further used in various industry sectors, such as automotive and electronics.
an anorak would contain around 20 grams of PTFE inlays.
Furthermore, as mentioned in recital 147, the impact of the anti-dumping duty on the users’ industry is expected to be negligible and therefore, will not necessarily prevent the final users to source PTFE from the same suppliers even at a higher price. (150) It should also be noted that Community consumption dropped from 2001 to 2002 by 12 % and then remained practically stable until the IP with a small growth of 3 % since 2002.
Therefore any reduction in the Community industry’s purchases would have a significant effect on the situation of these companies, which together employed 176 people directly dedicated to the production of the raw material concerned. (152) Another supplier stated that, without the imposition of measures, there would be a risk of migration of the Community PTFE production to third countries outside the Community.
PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES 1.
Any difference resulting from this comparison was then expressed as a percentage of the total CIF import value. (158) As far as Russia is concerned and due to the non-cooperation of Russian exporters as mentioned in recitals 70 to 75, the injury margin was determined on the basis of export figures as recorded in Eurostat.
It is noted that as mentioned in recital 98 above, the cif export price was adjusted taking into consideration the quality difference between the PTFE produced in the Community and that imported from Russia and the PRC.
In the absence of any other more reliable information, this adjustment was provisionally estimated with 5 % which was considered as a reasonable profit margin of an unrelated importer. (159) With regard to China and given that none of the cooperating Chinese producers was granted MES or IT, the provisional single countrywide injury elimination level was calculated as a weighted average of the injury margins of all three cooperating Chinese exporting producers. 2.
Provisional measures (160) In the light of the foregoing, it is considered that, in accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, provisional anti-dumping duties should be imposed in respect of imports originating in Russia and the PRC at the level of the lowest of the dumping and the injury margins, in accordance with the lesser duty rule. (161) The proposed provisional anti-dumping duties are as follows: Exporting country | Injury elimination margin | Dumping margin | Proposed anti-dumping duty | People’s Republic of China | 62,7 % | 99,7 % | 62,7 % | Russia | 46,7 % | 36,6 % | 36,6 % | H.
A provisional anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on so called granular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), containing not more than 3 % of other monomer unit than tetrafluoroethylene, without fillers, in the form of powder or pellets, with the exclusion of micronised materials, and its raw polymer (reactor bead), the latter in wet or dry form, falling within CN code ex39046100 (Taric code 3904610050) and originating in Russia and the People’s Republic of China. 2.
The rate of the provisional anti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, of the products described in paragraph 1, shall be as follows: Country | Rate of duty | People’s Republic of China | 62,7 % | Russia | 36,6 % | 3.
The release for free circulation in the Community of the product referred to in paragraph 1 shall be subject to the provisions of a security, equivalent to the amount of the provisional duty. 4.
