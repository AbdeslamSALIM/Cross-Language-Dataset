Pass the hexane solution through anhydrous sodium sulphate (50 g), wash with 20 ml hexane and evaporate in a rotary evaporator at 30 °C under reduced pressure until dryness. 6.2.
Separation of steroidal hydrocarbon fraction 6.2.1.
Working conditions for split injection: - injector temperature: 300 °C, - detector temperature: 320 °C, - integrator-recorder: the parameters for integration should be fixed so as to give a correct assessment of the areas.
Valley-valley integration mode is recommended, - sensitivity: about 16 times the minimum attenuation, - amount of solution injected: 1ìl, - oven programming temperatures: initial 235 °C for six minutes and then rising at 2 °C/minute up to 285 °C, - injector with 1: 15 flow divider, - carrier: helium or hydrogen at about 120 kPa pressure.
Peak identification The internal standard peak appears at approximately 19 minutes and the 3,5-stigmastadiene at a relative retention time of approximately 1,29 (see Figure 1b).

Heading Nos 1509 and 1510 cover only oils derived solely from the treatment of olives the analytical characteristics of the acidic and sterol composition of which are as follows: Table I Fatty acid composition as percentage of total fatty acids %gt%TABLE%gt% Table II Sterol composition as percentage of total sterols %gt%TABLE%gt% Heading Nos 1509 and 1510 do not cover chemically altered olive oil (in particular re-esterified olive oil) and mixtures of olive oil with other oils.

Subheading 1509 10 covers only olive oils defined in Sections I and II obtained solely using mechanical or other physical means under conditions, and particularly thermal conditions, that do not lead to deterioration of the oil, and which have undergone no treatment other than washing, decantation, centrifugation or filtration.
For the purposes of subheading 1509 10 90, 'virgin oil` means olive oil having the following characteristics: (a) an acid content, expressed as oleic acid, not exceeding 3,3 g per 100 g; (b) a peroxide number not exceeding 20 meq 02/kg; (c) a wax content not exceeding 250 mg/kg; (d) a content in volatile halogenated solvents not exceeding 0,20 mg/kg overall and not exceeding 0,10 mg/kg for each solvent; (e) a K270 extinction coefficient not higher than 0,250 and, after treatment of the oil with activated alumina, not higher than 0,10; (f) an extinction coefficient variation (delta K), in the 270 nm region, not higher than 0,01; (g) organoleptic characteristics which may include detectable defects within the limits of acceptability and a panel test score not lower than 3,5 in accordance with Annex XII to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91; (h) an erythradiol and uvaol content not exceeding 4,5 %; (ij) a content in saturated fatty acids at the 2-position in the triglycerides not exceeding 1,3 %; (k) the sum of transoleic isomers not exceeding 0,05 % and the sum of translinolenic + translinoleic isomers not exceeding 0,05 %; (l) a content in stigmastadienes not exceeding 0,15 mg/kg.
