GENERAL CONTEXT 1.1.
On 23 September 2002, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a Decision establishing a programme of Community action in the field of public health (2003-2008) [1] (hereinafter the "Programme Decision").
The principal aim in the first three years of the programme was to lay the foundations for a comprehensive and coherent approach, by concentrating on three key priorities: health information, health threats, and health determinants.
Priorities for 2006 will refocus certain key actions which have already been initiated, and will also cover the following new areas: (1) For health information: - New focus: Health Indicators (ECHI) at regional level, completion of the Injury Database, European Public Health Portal; - New priorities: gender specific health problems; rare diseases patient groups and European networks of centres of reference. (2) For health threats: - New priority: preparedness and response for influenza pandemic; - New focus: risk management and communication of health threats and hospital-acquired infections, now that the European Centre for disease prevention and control [3] has become operational and is taking over the risk assessment of health threats. (3) For health determinants: - New focus on nutrition, HIV/AIDS, denormalising smoking, reducing harm from drug use particularly in young people; - New priorities of EU presidencies: United Kingdom (inequalities), Austria (diabetes) [4], and Finland (health in all policies). 1.3.
Mechanisms for cooperation with international organisations In accordance with Article 11 of the Programme Decision [1], cooperation with international organisations competent in the sphere of public health shall be encouraged in the course of implementing the programme.
Cooperation with the WHO Cooperation with the WHO will be implemented in accordance with: - the "Agreement between the United Nations and the European Community on the principles applying to the financing or co-financing by the Community of programmes and projects administered by the United Nations" which entered into force on 9 August 1999, and the Verification Clause Agreement between the European Community and the United Nations which entered into force on 1 January 1995, as amended; - the exchange of letters between the WHO and the European Commission concerning the consolidation and intensification of cooperation (including the memorandum concerning the framework and arrangements for cooperation between the WHO and the European Commission forming part of the exchange of letters) [5].
Financial assistance by the European Commission for activities undertaken by the WHO shall, unless agreed otherwise in exceptional circumstances, be provided in accordance with the Financial and Administrative Framework Agreement between the European Community and the United Nations, which entered into force on 29 April 2003 (to which the WHO acceded on 11 December 2003).
