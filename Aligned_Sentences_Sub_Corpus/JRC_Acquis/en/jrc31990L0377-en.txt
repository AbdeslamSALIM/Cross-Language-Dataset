ANNEX I SPECIFIC PROVISIONS ON GAS 1.
Two types of gas are concerned: (a) natural gas; (b) manufactured gas (Âš). 2.
Where both types of gas are distributed in the same urban area or region, data on both must be reported except where consumption is less than 10 % of the total consumption of natural gas and manufactured gas in the places or regions referred to in point 11 below. 3.

If there are several possible tariffs, it is the tariff which is most advantageous to the consumer that is taken into account, after eliminating tariffs which are not used in practice or which apply only to a negligible number of users. 14.
Two price levels are to be shown (2): - with all taxes excluded, - with all taxes included (except recoverable VAT). 17.
The 'typical reference consumer' survey (for consumers with up to 10 MW maximum demand (net)). 1.
The existing survey of electricity prices for typical reference consumers in the Community carried out by the Commission will be extended to include two categories of reference industrial consumer with a maximum demand (net) of 10 MW, and will be incorporated in this Directive. 2.

The price of supply is calculated for cos f = 0,90.
In the case of tariffs based on demand expressed in kVA an adjustment is made by dividing the reference consumer's maximum demand (net) in kW by the coefficient cos f = 0,90. 4.

For tariffs with reductions for 'off-peak' periods, the following 'off-peak' consumptions should be assumed in calculating the average price per kWh: II. 5.

Prices should be given in national currency per kWh (1): - with all taxes excluded, - with all taxes included (except recoverable VAT).
The 'marker price' survey (for consumers above 10 MW maximum demand) 12.
To survey industrial consumers with maximum demands above 10 MW, a new system based on 'marker prices', as defined below shall be introduced. 13.
In all Member States except the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom, variations in the structure of charges and prices charged for large industrial consumers across the country are relatively small, and marker prices and associated information should be collected and published for the Member State as a whole.
However, in the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kindgom there may be significant geographical variations and so information for these two Member States should be communicated and published for three zones in each case, as follows: Member State Zones Federal Republic of Germany (2): - North/Central, - West, - South; United Kingdom: - England and Wales, - Scotland, - Northern Ireland. 14.
The marker price for a given MW categoriy (e.g. 25 MW) is the average price payable per kWh for a notional or 'marker price' industrial consumer with a normal demand of about 25 MW, but before any reductions for 'special factors', which should be reported separately (see paragraph 16 below).
The demand characteristics of this 'marker price' industrial consumer should be as representative as possible (ignoring 'special factors') of all the industrial consumers in the category in question.
In order to achieve a measure of homogeneity, the Commission will define demand characteristics for 'marker price' consumers for each category, (i.e. 25 MW, 50 MW and 75 MW), which should be used by utilities where appropriate.
If such demand characteristics are not appropriate, a utility may - North/Central: Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Bremen, Berlin, Lower Saxony, North Hessen, - West: North-Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, South Hessen, Saarland, - South: Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria.
