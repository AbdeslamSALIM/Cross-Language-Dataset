For barley, the Community decided to replace the system of preference margins by two tariff quotas, one for malting barley and one for barley, under Commission Regulation (EC) No 2376/2002(4). (2) Regulation (EC) No 2376/2002 opens a tariff quota of 300000 tonnes for imports of barley falling within CN code 1003 00 from third countries and derogates from Regulation (EC) No 1766/92.
A tariff import quota is hereby opened for 300000 tonnes of barley falling within CN code 1003 00. 2.
Duties on imports within the tariff quota shall be levied at a rate of EUR 16 per tonne.
For 2004, the second subparagraph shall apply to imports in excess of the quantities provided for in paragraph 3 of this Article in the period concerned. 3.
For 2004, the annual quota is divided into two tranches for the following periods: (a) tranche 1: 1 January to 30 April 2004 - 100000 tonnes; (b) tranche 2: 1 May to 31 December 2004 - 200000 tonnes.
If the total of the quantities granted since the start of the year and the quantity referred to in paragraph 2 exceeds the quota for the year concerned, the Commission shall set, no later than the third working day after the applications are lodged, a single reduction coefficient to be applied to the quantities requested.
For 2004, the single reduction coefficients referred to in the first subparagraph shall be set if the total of the quantities granted since the start of the period and the quantities referred to in paragraph 2 exceeds the quota for the period concerned. 4.
