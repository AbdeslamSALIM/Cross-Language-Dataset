THE SHELTER IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (SIP) The shelter enclosing the remains of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChNPP) Unit 4 was constructed under exceedingly hazardous conditions shortly after the accident on 26 April 1986.
In May 1997 an outline plan was finalised, in close co-operation with the international expert group, which became known as the Shelter Implementation Plan (SIP).
THE CHERNOBYL SHELTER FUND (CSF) At the G7 Denver Summit in June 1997, the G7 Heads of State and Government and the President of the European Commission endorsed the setting up of a multilateral funding mechanism to assist Ukraine in implementing the SIP.
The CSF was officially set up by the EBRD Board on 6 November 1997.
Under the rules of the Fund, the EBRD concluded a Framework Agreement with the government of Ukraine in November 1997 which paved the way for individual grant agreements to be concluded between the Bank and the Recipients.
Its first meeting took place on 12 December 1997.
Hans Blix (Sweden).
The Chernobyl Shelter Fund provides a very important tool to assist Ukraine in resolving the problems resulting from the Chernobyl accident.
The proposed new contribution will be subjected to the same conditions stated in Articles 1 and 3 of Council Decision 98/381/EC of 5 June 1998, as applicable.
The estimate presented by the EBRD in mid 2004 was $1,091 million[6] (instead of $768 million foreseen originally); the completion date was foreseen for end of 2008 (instead of 2007).
There were two fundamental differences between the 1997 and the 2004 estimates.
Those rules are not identical to those applied to operations directly financed through the Tacis programme, which cannot consequently cover the contribution which is the subject of this Decision. (7) It is, however, appropriate to ensure that, with regard to procurement arrangements made pursuant to the EBRD’s Rules of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund, there is no discrimination between individual Member States of the European Community, irrespective of whether they have concluded individual Contribution Agreements with the EBRD or not. (8) It is also appropriate that procurement arrangements with countries not belonging to the European Union or that are not TACIS partner countries be authorized, on a case by case basis, in the interest of the projects concerning the Chernobyl Shelter Implementation Plan. (9) The Treaties do not provide, for the adoption of this Decision, powers other than those of Article 308 of the EC Treaty and Article 203 of the Euratom Treaty, HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: Article 1 The Community shall make a contribution of €14.4 million euro to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (“EBRD”) for the Chernobyl Shelter Fund in 2006.
Article 3 In accordance with Article II, Section 2.02 of the Rules of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund, the Community contribution shall be the subject of a formal Contribution Agreement between the Commission and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Article 4 The Commission shall present to the European Parliament and to the Council, on a yearly basis, a progress report on the implementation of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund.
