That regulation provides for a ceiling of EUR 100000 over three years per company below which Article 87(1) can be deemed not to apply.
Since then, the sector has been subject to specific rules [2] which prevent the application of other exemption regimes [3]. 2.
Situation of the transport sector The approach chosen in 2001 is now regarded as being obsolete for the following reasons: 2.1.1.
In effect, the Court of Justice ruled in its "RENOVE" judgments of 26 September 2002 (C-351/98) [12] and 13 February 2003 (C-409/00) concerning road transport [13], that the exemption to the de minimis rule could not be applied to non-commercial transport, contrary to the Commission's approach, which was to regard a grant for the acquisition of lorries as being incompatible, without making a distinction between the different forms of organisation of transport activity.
However, in the road transport sector aid amounting to EUR 100000 over three years may be regarded as significant.
Conclusion In the light of the Commission's experience in many State aid cases in the transport sector over the years of non-application of the de minimis rule, it can be established that, with the exception of the acquisition of vehicles by road hauliers, aid to transport companies not exceeding a ceiling of EUR 100000 over a period of three years does not affect trade between Member States and does not distort or threaten to distort competition.
Application of the de minimis regulation does not, however, seem permissible.

[11] The Commission decisions referred to as "RENOVE": State aid decision C 20/1996 No 98/693/EC of 1 July 1998 (scheme for the period 1994 – 1996) and State aid decision C 65/1998 No 2001/605/EC (extension of the scheme in 1997); the Commission decisions referred to as "tax credits": State aid decision C 32/92 No 93/496/EEC of 9 June 1993 (the 1992 scheme) and State aid decision C 45/95 No 96/3078 of 22 October 1996 (the scheme for the period 1993-1994). [12] Case C-351/98, Spain v Commission, Judgment of 26 September 2002, Renove I, ECR I-8031. [13] Case C-409/00, Spain v Commission, Judgment of 13 February 2003, Renove II , ECR I-1487. [14] In these cases, the Court confirmed that while the own-account transport sector is not part of the transport sector envisaged in the rules concerning de minimis aid, that sector remains in direct competition with the commercial transport sector in the case of aid exceeding the de minimis threshold.
In 2000, there were 130141 freight transport undertakings in Spain, 112173 IN Italy, 32885 in Germany, 36819 in the United Kingdom and 10290 in the Netherlands (Source: Eurostat).
Analysis of the average turnover by undertaking in 2000 indicates a very low average in Spain and Italy, which is indicative of a large number of undertakings: EUR 160000 in Spain, EUR 280000 in Italy, and EUR 1350000 in the Netherlands and EUR 710000 in Germany.
The gradual and (compared to other sectors of the economy) recent liberalisation of the transport market, and structural problems in certain segments thereof, only allowed for the application of specific rules from the beginning. (4) Furthermore, the judgments of the Court of Justice of 26 September 2002 (C-351/98) [3] and 13 February 2003 (C-409/00) [4] in the "Renove I et II" cases concerning road transport ruled that the de minimis rule applies to support for own-account carriers.
However, as a result of the exclusion of the transport sector from the regulation, all schemes have to be notified to the Commission, which considerably reduces their usefulness. (7) In the light of the Commission's experience in many State aid cases in the transport sector over the years of non-application of the de minimis rule, it can be established that, with the exception of the acquisition of vehicles by road hauliers, aid for transport companies not exceeding a ceiling of EUR 100000 over a period of three years does not affect trade between Member States and does not distort or threaten to distort competition. (8) Given the exceptional structure of the road transport sector, the large number of small hauliers (particularly in certain Member States), and the cost of vehicles being close to the de minimis threshold, it should be considered that such amounts of aid can affect trade and distort competition between Member States to the detriment of the common interest.
