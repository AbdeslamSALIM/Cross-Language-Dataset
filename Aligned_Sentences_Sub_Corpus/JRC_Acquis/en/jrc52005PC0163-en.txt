line MON 863) genetically modified for resistance to corn rootworm /* COM/2005/0163 final */ Brussels, 26.04.2005 COM(2005)163 final Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION concerning the placing on the market, in accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, of a maize product (Zea mays L.
line MON 863 and hybrid MON 863 x MON 810), genetically modified for resistance to different insects. 2.
In accordance with Article 14 of the Directive, the German competent authority forwarded to the Commission its assessment report of the notification, which concluded that no reasons have emerged on the basis of which consent for the placing on the market of MON 863 maize as well as MON 863 x MON 810 maize should be withheld, if specific conditions are fulfilled. 4.
The EFSA concluded, in an opinion adopted on 2 April 2004, that from all evidence provided, the Zea mays L.
The EFSA also found that the scope of the monitoring plan provided by the applicant is in line with the intended uses of MON 863. 6.
Concerning hybrid MON 863 x MON 810, the EFSA considered that it is scientifically valid to use the data from the single lines MON 863 and MON 810 to support the safety assessment of hybrid MON 863 x MON 810, but decided regarding the need for confirmatory data for the safety assessment of the hybrid itself to request a 90-day sub-chronic rat study with the maize hybrid in order to complete its safety assessment.
Regarding hybrid MON 863 x MON 810, the Commission decided not to propose any decision pending the availability and assessment of the scientific information requested by EFSA. 9.
That assessment report concludes that no reasons have emerged on the basis of which consent for the placing on the market of MON 863 maize as well as MON 863 x MON 810 maize should be withheld, if specific conditions are fulfilled. (5) The competent authorities of other Member States raised objections to the placing on the market of the product. (6) The opinion adopted on 2 April 2004 by the European Food Safety Authority, concluded, from all evidence provided, that Zea mays L.
The European Food Safety Authority also found that the scope of the monitoring plan provided by the applicant is in line with the intended uses of MON 863. (7) Concerning hybrid MON 863 x MON 810, the European Food Safety Authority considered that it is scientifically valid to use the data from the single lines MON 863 and MON 810 to support the safety assessment of hybrid MON 863 x MON 810, but decided regarding the need for confirmatory data for the safety assessment of the hybrid itself to request a 90-day sub-chronic rat study with the maize hybrid in order to complete its safety assessment.
Article 2Product 1.
The genetically modified organisms to be placed on the market as or in products, hereinafter ‘the product’, are grains of maize ( Zea mays L.), with resistance to the corn rootworm ( Diabrotica spp. ), derived from the Zea mays cell culture line AT824 (initiated from immature embryos of an inbred maize line AT), which has been transformed using particle acceleration technology with a Mlu I DNA restriction fragment isolated from plasmid PV-ZMIR13.
The consent shall cover grains from progeny derived from crosses of maize line MON 863 with any traditionally bred maize as or in products.
Article 4Monitoring 1.
The consent holder shall directly inform the operators, users, national agencies for animal nutrition and feed research as well as veterinary services of the introduction of MON 863 maize into the Community as well as on the safety and general characteristics of the product and of the conditions as to monitoring. 3.
Without prejudice to Article 20 of Directive 2001/18/EC the monitoring plan as notified shall, where appropriate and subject to the agreement of the Commission and the competent authority of the Member State which received the original notification, be revised by the consent holder, and/or by the competent authority of the Member State which received the original notification, in the light of the results of the monitoring activities. 5.
