PROVISIONAL MEASURES (1) The Commission, by Regulation (EC) No 771/2005 [2] (the provisional Regulation) imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof, falling within CN codes 73181210, 73181410, 73181530, 73181551, 73181561 and 73181570 originating in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. (2) It is recalled that the investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 (IP).
The examination of trends relevant for the injury analysis covered the period from 1 January 2001 to 30 June 2004 (period considered).
SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE (3) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping measures, certain interested parties submitted comments in writing. (4) Those parties who so requested were granted an opportunity to be heard by the Commission. (5) The Commission continued to seek and verify all information it deemed necessary for its definitive findings. (6) Parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty and the definitive collection of amounts secured by way of the provisional duty.
They were also granted a period within which to make representations subsequent to this disclosure. (7) The oral and written comments were considered and, where deemed appropriate, taken into account in the definitive findings. (8) Following the imposition of provisional measures, one importer and its association questioned the representativeness of the Community industry, as set out under recital 113 of the provisional Regulation, within the meaning of Article 5(4) of the basic Regulation.
However, no evidence was produced to substantiate this claim.
The investigation has confirmed that the Community industry accounted for approximately 54 % of the Community production during the IP and has standing within the meaning of Article 5(4) of the basic Regulation. (9) The cooperating Thai exporting producers contended upon disclosure that the non-confidential questionnaire replies of the Community producers were not sufficiently detailed and not filed in accordance with Article 19 of the basic Regulation.
Consequently, in line with the conclusions drawn in recitals 14 and 105 of the provisional Regulation, the proceeding should be terminated as regards the Philippines. (13) Following the imposition of provisional measures, the cooperating Thai exporting producers alleged that nuts and bolts are normally marketed and developed together and, therefore, if nuts were to be excluded from the product scope, bolts should be excluded from the scope of the proceeding as well.
Consequently, and in light of the findings set out in recitals 11 and 12 that nuts are not marketed and developed together with bolts, the claim was rejected and only nuts were excluded from the scope of the proceeding. (14) Furthermore, several importers and their association reiterated their claim to further limit the investigation to two CN codes, namely 73181561 (hexagon socket head screws of stainless steel) and 73181570 (hexagon bolts of stainless steel).
In this context, it should be considered that the Community industry has significant spare capacity (see table before recital 127 in the provisional Regulation).
Consequently, the claim to further limit the product scope has to be rejected. (18) Since no other comments were submitted, the findings concerning the product concerned and the like product as set out in recitals 10 to 18 of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.
The findings set out in recitals 19 to 32 of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.
This means that the same measure applies to all exporting producers in Vietnam. (22) In the absence of any other comments, the findings set out in recitals 55 to 61 of the provisional Regulation concerning individual treatment are hereby confirmed. 3.
Normal value 3.1.
Thus, the findings set out in recitals 62 to 64 of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 3.2.
Methodology applied for the determination of normal value (24) Four Thai exporting producers argued that the selling, general and administrative (SG%amp%A) expenses and the profit realised on domestic sales in another country, in this case Taiwan, cannot be used for constructing their normal value.
However, as set out in recital 80 of the provisional Regulation, these exporting producers had no representative sales of the like product, or other products in the same general category, in the ordinary course of trade.
No information was provided to show that the profit so used would exceed the profit normally realised by other exporters or producers on sales of the same general category of products in Thailand. (25) No other comments were raised concerning the methodology applied for the determination of normal value and thus the methodology set out in recitals 65 to 72 of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. 3.3.
Export price (43) In the absence of any comments, the findings set out in recitals 82 to 91 of the provisional Regulation concerning the establishment of the export price pursuant to Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation for all countries concerned are hereby confirmed. 5.
Comparison (44) In the absence of any comments, the methodology and the findings set out in recitals 92 and 93 of the provisional Regulation concerning the comparison between normal value and export price are hereby confirmed. 6.
Dumping margins 6.1.
General methodology (45) In the absence of any comments concerning the determination of the dumping margin, the methodology set out in recitals 94 to 100 of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. 6.2.
Consequently, as stated above in recital 12, the proceeding should be terminated as regards imports of the product concerned from the Philippines. (e) Taiwan (50) In the absence of any further comments on the calculation of the provisional dumping margins for Taiwan, as set out in recitals 106 to 108 of the provisional Regulation, the definitive dumping margins, expressed as a percentage of the CIF import price at the Community border, duty unpaid, are the following: Arrow Fasteners Co.
Ltd, Taipei 15,2 % Jin Shing Stainless Ind.
Ltd, Tao Yuan 18,8 % Min Hwei Enterprise Co.
Ltd, Samutsakorn 10,8 % Dura Fasteners Company Ltd, Samutprakarn 14,6 % Siam Screws (1994) Co.
Therefore, in the interests of having as complete an assessment as possible within the time available in this case, data received and verified for trends in all injury factors from the sampled producers was complemented by information relating to the full industry. (57) No other comment has been submitted concerning Community production and the definition of the Community industry and, therefore, the findings set out in recitals 111 to 114 of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 2.
They pointed out that in 2002, volume and market share of Thai imports dropped by 29 % and 35 % respectively, whereas already in 2002 an increase can be observed with regard to the other countries concerned.
Furthermore, they noted that since 2003, average Thai import prices increased by 2 %. (59) It should be recalled that the margins of dumping established in relation to the imports from each country concerned are more than de minimis as defined in Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation, i.e. 2 %, and the volume of imports from each country concerned is above the threshold of 1 % market share set by Article 5(7) of the basic Regulation.
Furthermore, it is pertinent to note that the analysis should not focus on 2002 in isolation, but on the overall picture during the period considered, i.e.
Furthermore, it is recalled that the SSF imported from the countries concerned were alike in all respects, they are interchangeable, they are marketed in the Community through comparable sales channels and under similar commercial conditions and compete with the SSF produced in the Community.
Therefore, and in line with Article 3(4) of the basic Regulation, it is confirmed that a cumulative assessment of the effects of the dumped imports of the product concerned is appropriate. (60) No other comment has been submitted concerning the analysis of the situation on the Community market and, therefore, the findings set out in recitals 115 to 126 of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 3.
Therefore, the findings set out in recitals 127 to 133, 137, 142, 143, 145 and 146 of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 3.1.
Profitability (62) The cooperating Thai exporting producers contended that the profitability situation of the sampled Community producers had improved and did not reflect any injury.
They further argued that the Community industry has not achieved the minimum profit margin of 5 % considered adequate and achievable in the absence of dumping because of the investments made by the sampled Community producers in 2002 and 2003.
They also argued to disregard the fact that the Community industry benefited from the use of low priced stainless steel because this should be considered as a normal market situation from which all operators have benefited. (63) It should be recalled, as set out in recitals 149 and 150 of the provisional Regulation, that the profitability situation was neither the only factor, nor the central factor, showing injury in the present case.
Investments were necessary to remain competitive, as set out in recital 138 of the provisional Regulation, so that no negative impact on profitability can be attributed to such investment.
Furthermore, as set out in recital 136 of the provisional Regulation, the positive effect on the sampled Community producers’ profitability from the rising stainless steel prices during the IP was strictly temporary and was a factor which may have benefited other economic operators for a very short period. (64) Thus, the allegation that the profitability situation does not reflect injury has to be rejected and the findings set out in recitals 134 to 136 of the provisional Regulation confirmed. 3.2.
Investments, return on investment, cash flow and the ability to raise capital (65) The cooperating Thai exporting producers pointed out that the rising investments, return on investment, cash flow as well as the ability to raise capital did not indicate any injury. (66) As mentioned in recital 147 of the provisional Regulation, it should be recalled that the factors "investment" and "ability to raise capital" have not been considered as factors showing injury during the period considered. (67) With regard to return on investment, however, the overall improvement over the period considered needs to be viewed in the context of (i) the temporary and exceptional nature of the profitability situation of the sampled Community producers during the IP as already set out in recitals 136 and 139 of the provisional Regulation and (ii) the increased usage of leased machinery, which has not been considered as an investment.
These two reasons explain the artificially high increase on return on investment during the IP. (68) Concerning cash flow, the fact remains that over the period considered its development deteriorated by 36 %, and this clearly indicates injury over the period considered.
Consequently, the findings set out in recitals 138 to 141 of the provisional Regulation should be confirmed. 3.3.
However, the fact remains that employment decreased by 5 % over the period considered, which was assessed as a sign of injury.
Consequently, the findings set out in recital 144 of the provisional Regulation should be confirmed. 3.4.
Conclusion on injury (71) In summary, the conclusions set out in recitals 147 to 150 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.
In the absence of any other comments, the findings set out in the provisional Regulation concerning the effect of dumped imports (recital 152 of the provisional Regulation), the impact of imports from other third countries (recitals 153 to 159 of the provisional Regulation) and the development of consumption on the Community market (recital 160 of the provisional Regulation) are hereby confirmed. 1.
The undercutting margins were found to be significant (see recitals 125 and 126 of the provisional Regulation). (75) In light of the above, the argument regarding the possible effect of exchange rate movements must be rejected. 2.
Competitiveness of the Community industry (76) The Thai exporting producers further submitted that the injury endured by the Community industry should be attributed to a lack of competitiveness due to allegedly outdated production facilities. (77) However, it should be recalled that the Community industry constantly invested over the period considered in order to replace obsolete machinery and to maintain "state of the art" production facilities.
The argument should be therefore rejected and the findings set out in recital 161 of the provisional Regulation concerning the competitiveness of the Community industry are confirmed. 3.
Conclusion on causation (80) In summary, an appreciation of the above comments on causation and for the reasons set out in recitals 151 to 162 of the provisional Regulation, it is confirmed that no other factor has broken the causal link between the imports from the five countries concerned taken together and the material injury sustained by the Community industry.
Impact of the measures on importers and users (82) The importers/distributors, pointed out that measures would have a direct impact on their profit margins as they would not be able to pass on the costs of measures to their customers through higher prices. (83) First of all, these parties did not substantiate their allegations.
The findings set out in recitals 164 to 170 of the provisional Regulation should be therefore confirmed. (84) The Thai exporting producers commented that the imposition of measures would increase costs for the European car industry and this would not be in the Community’s interest.
The findings set out in recitals 173 and 174 of the provisional Regulation concerning interests of users and consumers should therefore be confirmed. 2.
Conclusion (85) Having examined the various interests involved, it is confirmed for the reasons given in recitals 163 to 175 of the provisional Regulation that from an overall Community interest perspective no interest overweighs the Community industry’s interest to have anti-dumping measures imposed with the aim of eliminating the trade distorting effects resulting from dumped imports.
The price difference was expressed as a percentage of the CIF import value. (88) The non-injurious price has been obtained by taking the weighted cost of production of the Community industry together with a profit margin of 5 %.
Form and level of the duty (89) In the light of the foregoing, it is considered that, in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, a definitive anti-dumping duty should be imposed on imports of SSF from the People’s Republic of China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. (90) With regard to the level of duty, in the case of two cooperating exporting producers (one in Taiwan and one in the PRC), the injury elimination level was found to be lower than the dumping margin.
In all other cases, the level of the duty should be set at the level of the dumping margin found pursuant to Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation. (91) On the basis of the above, the definitive duty rates should be as follows: Country | Exporting producer | AD duty rate | The PRC | Tengzhou Tengda Stainless Steel Product Co., Ltd, Tengzhou City | 11,4 % | Tong Ming Enterprise (Jiaxing) Co.
Ltd, Zhejiang | 12,2 % | All other companies | 27,4 % | Indonesia | PT.
Ltd, Tainan | 11,4 % | Cooperating exporting producers not included in the sample | 15,8 % | All other companies | 23,6 % | Thailand | A.B.P.
In these circumstances, it is considered appropriate to impose an anti-dumping duty on imports from Thailand at the abovementioned rates. (93) The individual company anti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation were established on the basis of the findings of the present investigation.
A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof, falling within CN codes 73181210, 73181410, 73181530, 73181551, 73181561 and 73181570 and originating in the People’s Republic of China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. 2.
The rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, for products manufactured by the Taiwanese exporting producers listed in the Annex shall be 15,8 % (TARIC additional code A649). 3.
The rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, for products manufactured by the companies listed below shall be as follows: Country | Exporting producer | Rate of duty (%) | TARIC additional code | The People’s Republic of China | Tengzhou Tengda Stainless Steel Product Co., Ltd, Tengzhou City | 11,4 | A650 | Tong Ming Enterprise (Jiaxing) Co.
Ltd, Zhejiang | 12,2 | A651 | All other companies | 27,4 | A999 | Indonesia | PT.
Ltd, Tainan | 11,4 | A657 | All companies other than the above and those listed in the Annex | 23,6 | A999 | Thailand | A.B.P.
Ltd, Samutsakorn | 11,0 | A661 | All other companies | 14,6 | A999 | Vietnam | All companies | 7,7 | — | 4.
Article 2 Amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping duty pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 771/2005 imposing an anti-dumping duty on imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof, falling within CN codes 73181210, 73181410, 73181530, 73181551, 73181561 and 73181570 originating in the People’s Republic of China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam shall be definitively collected, in accordance with the rules set out below.
Article 3 The proceeding concerning imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in Malaysia and the Philippines is hereby terminated.
Article 4 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
