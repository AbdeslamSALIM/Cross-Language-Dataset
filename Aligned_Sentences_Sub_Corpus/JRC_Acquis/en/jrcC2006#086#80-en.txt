Pleas in law and main arguments The applicant seeks the partial annulment of the Commission Decision C(2005) 4634 final of 30 November 2005 in Case COMP/F/38.354 — Industrial bags.
According to the applicant, the Commission failed to establish that Rosenlew Saint Frères Emballage took part in cartel activities in the block bags sector and participated in the Valveplast meetings at the European level as of 20 December 2004.
In addition, the applicants states that there is insufficient proof of Rosenlew Saint Frères Emballage's involvement in the meetings of the French group on open mouth bags until 31 January 1999.
Second, the applicant submits that the Commission erroneously assessed the duration of Rosenlew Saint Frères Emballage participation in the cartel activities.
