Council Regulation (EC) No%nbsp%716/2006 of 5 May 2006 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of dead-burned (sintered) magnesia originating in the People's Republic of China Council Regulation (EC) No 716/2006 of 5 May 2006 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of dead-burned (sintered) magnesia originating in the People's Republic of China THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to the Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [1] (hereinafter referred to as the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 9 and 11(2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: A.
These measures took the form of a minimum import price. (2) Following an expiry review, these anti-dumping measures were maintained in February 2000 by Council Regulation (EC) No 360/2000 [3]. (3) Following an interim review, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 986/2003 [4], amended the form of the anti-dumping measures in force by maintaining the minimum price but subject to specific conditions and imposing an ad valorem duty of 63,3 % in all other cases. 2.
Request for a review (4) Following the publication of a notice of impending expiry of the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of DBM originating in the PRC [5], the Commission's services received a request in November 2004 to review these measures pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation. (5) The request was lodged by Eurométaux, acting on behalf of Community producers (hereinafter referred to as the applicant producers) representing a major proportion, in this case more than 50 %, of the total Community production of DBM. (6) The request was based on the grounds that the expiry of the measures would be likely to result in a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury to the Community industry.
Investigation (7) The Commission's services officially advised the applicant Community producers, the other Community producers, the exporting producers in the PRC (hereinafter Chinese exporters), the importers, traders, users and their associations known to be concerned, as well as the representatives of the government of the exporting country, of the initiation of the review. (8) The Commission's services sent questionnaires to all these parties and to those who made themselves known within the time limit set in the notice of initiation. (9) The Commission's services also gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. (10) In view of the apparent high number of exporting producers in the PRC and importers of the product concerned, sampling was envisaged in the notice of initiation, in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation.
Investigation period (14) The investigation of continuation or recurrence of dumping covered the period from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004 (hereinafter referred to as IP).
The examination of the trends relevant for the assessment of a likelihood of a continuation or recurrence of injury covered the period from 1 January 2000 up to the end of the IP (the period considered).
The result is DBM with a MgO (magnesium oxide) content ranging from 80 to 98 %.
LIKELIHOOD OF A CONTINUATION OF DUMPING (18) In accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether the expiry of the measures would be likely to lead to a continuation of dumping. 1.
It is recalled that in the previous investigation, a dumping margin in the order of 50 % was established.
Analogue country (24) In calculating normal value, account was taken of the fact that for this investigation the normal value for imports from the PRC had to be based on data from a market economy third country in accordance with Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation.
Normal value (28) In accordance with Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation, it was considered whether sufficient domestic sales of the product concerned had been made by the producer in Turkey in the ordinary course of trade.
As the volume of profitable transactions was higher than 80 %, and the weighted average price was above the cost of production plus selling, general and administrative costs, normal value was established on the basis of the weighted average prices actually paid for sales of the product concerned on the domestic Turkish market.
In accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, and in the absence of any cooperation from Chinese exporters, the weighted average sales price of the Turkish producer was used as there was no information as to the product types imported from the PRC into the Community and no information was available that suggested that the product mix of Chinese exports to the Community and Turkish domestic sales was substantially different.
In the absence of any information submitted indicating any change in this respect, an adjustment corresponding to 25 % of the cost of manufacturing found for the cooperating Turkish producer was therefore made to take account of this difference.
Dumping margin (34) The comparison of normal value and export price showed the existence of dumping, the dumping margin being equal to the amount by which normal value, so established, exceeded the price for export to the Community.
Chinese production capacity (36) According to the expiry review request, Chinese producers have substantial spare production capacity as they have the largest magnesite ore resource in the world, estimated at 1300 million tonnes.
Chinese export prices to the Community (37) According to Eurostat figures, the export price of Chinese DBM to the Community has dropped by 10 % between 2000 and the IP, whereas measures were in force.
Therefore, during the period considered, exports to the EC became more attractive to Chinese exporters compared to exports to Japan, and Chinese exporters have had an incentive to export larger volumes to the EC. (41) Between 2000 and the IP, prices of Chinese exports to the United States of America (USA) increased considerably, from USD 129 per tonne to USD 208 per tonne during the IP, which corresponds to EUR 140 per tonne and EUR 167 per tonne, respectively. (42) In respect of this huge increase in export prices to the USA, it has to be noted that during the period considered all US producers of natural DBM stopped gradually their activity, and that Chinese imports of DBM dominated the US market.
Indeed, they accounted for around 82 % of the consumption of dead-burned magnesia in the US during the IP. (43) With comparatively high prices, in particular in view of the higher price level of exports to the USA than to the EC, the US market may thus have become more attractive to Chinese exporters of DBM during the period considered.
However, the export quantities of DBM to the USA did not increase overall between the beginning of the period considered and the IP, and remained around 340000 tonnes per year.
Furthermore, while the overall evolution during the period considered showed an increase of 6 %, considerable increases have occurred in the last years of the period considered (+ 36 % between 2001 and 2004). (49) As there is no indication that the trends observed during the last years of the period considered would not continue, the information available shows that a further decrease in prices and a further increase in volume are likely to happen.
Indeed, the expected further increase of Chinese exports to the EC would probably be made at the expense of the Community industry, in other words at prices at or even below the current dumped price levels in order to gain market share. (50) Furthermore, it has to be pointed out that, as described in recital 73 of Regulation (EC) No 360/2000, the Chinese export prices and quantities are currently influenced by the export licence system put in place by the Chinese authorities, indicating that, should this system be abolished, the Chinese exporters have the potential to raise their export volume and to lower their export price.
The investigation established that the three applicant and fully cooperating Community producers represented around 55 % of the Community production of DBM and, therefore, constitute the Community industry within the meaning of Article 4(1) and Article 5(4) of the basic Regulation. (53) One producer did not cooperate, but did also not oppose the investigation.
Consumption in the Community market (62) Community consumption was based on the combined volume of sales made by the Community industry in the Community, excluding captive use, imports from the PRC and imports from other third countries. (63) On this basis, during the period considered, Community consumption increased by 32 %, from 693145 tonnes in 2000 to 911672 tonnes in the IP.
Community consumption | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Free market (tonnes) | 693145 | 792575 | 701723 | 817678 | 911672 | Index | 100 | 114 | 101 | 118 | 132 | Y/Y trend | | 14 | –13 | 17 | 14 | (64) For the purpose of completing the information provided for Community consumption on the free market, the consumption for captive use was also calculated, based on verified questionnaire replies of the Community industry and on market information provided by the applicant producers.
It was found that the consumption for captive use increased by 12 % during the period considered.

They decreased first by 25 % on average from 2000 to 2002, and then increased between 2002 and the IP by 41 %.
Overall, during the period considered imports from the PRC increased by 6 %, from 349561 to 369079 tonnes.

Over the whole period considered, it decreased by 10 % and reached EUR 140 per tonne in the IP.
Average import price from the PRC | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | EUR/tonne | 156 | 184 | 179 | 138 | 140 | Index | 100 | 118 | 114 | 88 | 90 | Y/Y trend | | 18 | –3 | –26 | 2 | (68) The Commission has examined whether the exporting producers in the country concerned undercut the prices of the Community industry during the IP.
In order to bring prices to a comparable basis, the Community producer's prices have been adjusted to an ex-works level. (69) The undercutting margin found on this basis was 7,6 %. 3.
Economic situation of the Community industry (a) Analysis of the factors pertinent to the entire activity, including captive use Production, production capacity and capacity utilisation (70) The Community industry's production increased by 11 % during the period considered, following to some extent the trend of the Community consumption.
The decrease of the production by three percentage points in 2002 coincided with the contraction of the consumption of DBM in the Community market.
Production volume | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Index | 100 | 101 | 98 | 108 | 111 | Y/Y trend | | 1 | –3 | 10 | 3 | (71) During the period considered, the production capacity of the Community industry first remained stable between 2000 and 2002 and then increased by 3 % between 2002 and the IP.
Capacity utilisation decreased by 2 % between 2000 and 2002 but increased after 2002, so that over the period considered it increased by 7 %.

Stocks (76) The table below shows that stocks increased significantly during the period considered by 88 %.
However, in absolute terms this increase is not significant. (77) The ratio of stocks volume to production volume, which attained 4 % in 2000, increased to around 7 % in the IP.

The profitability then increased from 3,9 % in 2002 to 11,4 % in the IP.
Over the period considered, the average profit made by the Community industry was 4,5 %. (87) Return on investments, expressed as profits/losses in relation to the net book value of investments, followed the same trend as the profitability.

The major exporters to the Community have been Australia, North Korea, Turkey, Brazil, Russia and South Korea. (91) The market share of imports originating in the third countries other than the PRC increased by 15,6 percentage points during the period considered and represented 39,3 %.
Market share of imports from other third countries | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Percentage of free market | 23,7 % | 45,2 % | 39,5 % | 37,1 % | 39,3 % | Index | 100 | 191 | 167 | 157 | 166 | Y/Y trend | | 91 | –24 | –10 | 9 | (92) The average import prices from other third countries were higher than those of the Community industry during the IP except the import prices from North Korea, Russia and South Korea.
It has to be noted that imports of the product concerned from those three countries represented only 8,9 % of all imports to the Community during the period considered, with a cumulated market share in the Community of 7,1 %, compared to the market share of 40 % of the PRC.

Conclusion on the situation of the Community industry (94) The measures in force have led to a partial recovery of the Community industry since 2000.
Import prices from other third countries, except Russia, North Korea and South Korea, were higher than Community industry's sales prices during the period considered, while the average price of dumped Chinese imports decreased by 10 %. (99) As regards the relatively low prices of imports from Russia, North Korea and South Korea, their average export prices to the EC decreased less in proportion than those of Chinese exports to the EC.
Therefore, during the IP the economic effect of Chinese imports on the Community DBM market by far outweighed the effect of imports from Russia, North Korea and South Korea, and nothing indicates that this will change in the future. (100) As already described in more detail in recitals 45 to 50, if the anti-dumping measures were allowed to expire, it is likely that imports at dumped prices of the product concerned from the PRC would increase and prices would decrease for the following reasons: - the PRC has considerable spare production capacity and has the largest magnesite ore resources in the world, - the trends of prices and volumes during the period considered already show a likely further decrease in prices and increase in volume, - the prices which Chinese exporters might charge in the absence of anti-dumping measures are potentially very low if it is considered that they include the export licence fee, - the Community market is attractive in terms of volume, and, since exports to third countries are unlikely to increase to a significant extent, Chinese exporters would likely, if the current measures were allowed to expire, attempt to increase their market share in the EC by further decreasing their export price. (101) It can be concluded that the considerable volume of Chinese imports at low and decreasing prices have exerted an increasing pressure on the Community DBM market, which would in all likelihood continue to intensify, should the anti-dumping measures lapse, as import prices from the PRC would likely decrease whilst volumes of export would rise.
The surge of imports from the PRC would very likely result in a further decrease in the Community industry's market share, and given the parallel evolution of the Community industry sales prices and profitability during the period considered, the increased pressure on prices would almost certainly result in a decrease in the Community industry's profit.
Introduction (104) According to Article 21 of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether a prolongation of the existing anti-dumping measures would be against the interest of the Community as a whole.
Although the representativeness of the cooperating company for the downstream industry is limited, since it purchased less than 5 % of the total DBM imported from the PRC during the IP, the impact of the measures in force on its situation was evaluated. (113) In this respect, the investigation established that the cooperating user continued to import DBM originating from the PRC in spite of the measures in force.
Therefore, the continuation of measures is in the interest of the Community industry. (119) Furthermore, in the past, the existing measures appeared not to have any significant negative effects on the economic situation of users and importers.
The amount of the duty shall be (a) the difference between the minimum import price of EUR 120 per tonne and the net, free-at-Community frontier price, before duty, in all cases where the latter is: - less than the minimum import price, and - established on the basis of an invoice issued by an exporter located in the People's Republic of China directly to an unrelated party in the Community (Taric additional code A439). (b) zero, if the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, is established on the basis of an invoice issued by an exporter located in the People's Republic of China directly to an unrelated party in the Community and equal to or higher than the minimum import price of EUR 120 per tonne (Taric additional code A439). (c) equal to an ad valorem duty of 63,3 % in all other cases not falling under subparagraph (a) and (b) above (Taric additional code A999). 3.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
