Every year, the Member States shall send the Commission a list of the EC type-approvals of these vehicles.
Article 10 End-of-series vehicles 1.
For end-of-series vehicles, Member States may, at the request of the manufacturer, within the quantitative limits set out in Annex V, Section B, and for the limited period specified in the third subparagraph, register and permit the sale or entry into service of new vehicles that conform to a type of vehicle the approval of which is no longer valid.
This option shall be restricted to a period of 24 months for complete vehicles and 30 months for completed vehicles from the date of expiry of the EC type-approval. 2.
Article 11 Incompatibility of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units For vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units designed in accordance with techniques or principles that are incompatible with one or more of the requirements of one or more of the separate directives: (a) a Member State may grant a provisional EC type-approval.
In this case, it must, within one month, send a copy of the EC type-approval certificate and its attachments to the approval authorities in the other Member States and to the Commission.
In no case shall the period of validity of the EC type-approval be less than 36 months; (d) where the separate directives have been adapted to technical progress in such a way that the types of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units approved under this Article comply with the amended directives, the Member States shall convert those EC type-approvals into EC type-approvals which comply with this Directive, allowing the time needed for the necessary changes to components or separate technical units, in particular, the removal of any references to restrictions or exemptions; (e) if the action needed to adapt the specific separate directives has not been taken, the validity of the EC type-approvals granted under this Article may be extended, at the request of the Member State having granted the EC type-approval, by means of another Commission decision; (f) an exemption granted for the first time under this Article can serve as a reference for the Committee referred to in Article 20(1) for further, identical requests.
Article 12 Equivalence 1.
The equivalence of EC type-approvals issued on the basis of the separate directives on motor vehicles as defined in Directive 70/156/EEC and set out in Annex II, Chapter B, Part II-A, to this Directive, is acknowledged. 3.
Article 13 Arrangements to ensure conformity of production 1.
A Member State granting an EC type-approval shall take the measures referred to in Annex IV in relation to that approval to verify, where appropriate in cooperation with the EC type-approval authorities in the other Member States, that adequate arrangements have been made to ensure that the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units produced conform to the approved type. 2.
A Member State which has granted an EC type-approval shall take the measures referred to in Annex IV in relation to that approval to verify, where appropriate in cooperation with the EC type-approval authorities in the other Member States, that the arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 continue to be adequate and that the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units produced continue to conform to the approved type.
Article 14 Obligation to provide information The competent EC type-approval authorities in the Member States shall inform each other within one month of any withdrawal of EC type-approval and of the reasons for any such measure.
