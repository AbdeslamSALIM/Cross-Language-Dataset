On 17 March 2005, the Commission imposed, by Regulation (EC) No 426/2005 ('the provisional Regulation'), a provisional anti-dumping duty on the imports into the Community of certain finished polyester filament fabrics originating in the country concerned.
As stated in recital (8)(a) of the provisional Regulation, the Community producers requested in terms of Article 19 of the basic Regulation that their details are not published, as to do so would have a significantly adverse effect upon them.
Company 2 challenged the Commission’s conclusions that this company does not have one clear set of independently audited accounting records used for all purposes.
It is noted that the inventory value represented more than 10% of the balance sheet total of that company.
It should be noted that in this specific case, the Commission’s conclusions were based on the fact that the company originally stated in the MET claim form that all its assets were bought from the open market, which was found incorrect during the verification visit.
It argued that this is evidenced by the fact that MET has been granted to 22 companies, but only 7 companies were visited on the spot.
Finally, the last claim made by the company should also be rejected because the consequences of the non-cooperation were made clear by paragraph 8 of the notice of initiation. 4.
Dumping margin 7.1.
The claims were therefore rejected.
Imports into the Community from the country concerned 4.1.
Therefore, the findings as set out in these recitals of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed and it is concluded that the Community industry has suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic Regulation.
