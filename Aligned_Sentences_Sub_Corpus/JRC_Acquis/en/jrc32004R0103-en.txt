Commission Regulation (EC) No 103/2004 of 21 January 2004 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as regards intervention arrangements and market withdrawals in the fruit and vegetable sector Commission Regulation (EC) No 103/2004 of 21 January 2004 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as regards intervention arrangements and market withdrawals in the fruit and vegetable sector THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), and in particular Article 30(6) and (7) and Article 48 thereof, Whereas: (1) The experience gained from the implementation of Commission Regulation (EC) No 659/97 of 16 April 1997 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as regards intervention arrangements in the fruit and vegetables sector(2) has shown that certain changes need to be made to those arrangements.
Regulations (EC) No 659/97 and (EC) No 1492/97 should therefore be repealed. (2) Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 establishes the intervention arrangements for the products referred to in Article 1(2) thereof and provides for the grant of Community compensation for the products listed in Annex II thereto.
The terms %quot%marketed quantity%quot% and %quot%marketed production%quot% should also be covered by a single definition, which should be consistent with the term %quot%value of production marketed%quot% as used in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1433/2003 of 11 August 2003 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as regards operational funds, operational programmes and financial assistance(4) and should thus include quantities withdrawn from the market for subsequent free distribution. (4) It should be specified that the provisions relating to packaging requirements are to apply to products withdrawn from the market only in the case of miniature products which might otherwise be confused with products not meeting the minimum size requirements. (5) The marketing years for the products concerned and detailed rules on averages over a three-year period as referred to in Article 23(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 should be defined. (6) In order to enable the inspection authorities to plan their inspection operations, producer organisations must notify them in advance of each withdrawal operation.
The procedures for implementing food aid should be compatible with the general principles pursued by the Community regarding food aid in kind. (10) In order to facilitate the free distribution of withdrawn products, the processing of products withdrawn for free distribution should be authorised, either at the expense of the charitable organisation or through any other procedure which guarantees equal treatment of the processors concerned. (11) Where fruit and vegetables withdrawn from the market are intended for free distribution, the transport, sorting and packaging costs are to be borne by the Community pursuant to Article 30(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96.
Standard rates should be fixed for the payment of transport, sorting and packaging costs. (12) Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that products withdrawn from the market may be put to certain uses other than free distribution.
In order to ensure that the distillation of such products does not disturb the market in alcohol, such distillation alcohol should be denatured and intended for industrial, non-food uses. (13) Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 requires the Member States to establish a national framework for drawing up the general conditions relating to the withdrawal methods which respect the environment.
Article 2 Definitions 1.
For the purposes of this Regulation, %quot%products withdrawn from the market%quot%, %quot%market withdrawals%quot% and %quot%products not put up for sale%quot% mean products: (a) not sold through a producer organisation as referred to in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, in accordance with the intervention arrangements referred to in Title IV of that Regulation; (b) withdrawn from the market as referred to in Article 15(2)(a) of that Regulation. 2.
