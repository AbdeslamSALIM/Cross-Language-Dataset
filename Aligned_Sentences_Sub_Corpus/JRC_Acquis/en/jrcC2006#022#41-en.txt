By that decision, the Commission declared to be incompatible with the common market the provisions of Article 12 of Decree Law No 269/2003, converted into Law No 326/2003.
It provides, essentially, that the rate of tax replacing income tax levied on the net profits of the various types of investment funds and open-ended investment companies is to be reduced from 12.5 % to 5 % where the funds or companies invest during the calendar year at least two-thirds of the value of their assets, for more than one-sixth of the fund's business days, in small or medium-sized quoted capitalisation funds.
