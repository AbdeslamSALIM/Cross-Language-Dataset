The first pillar regarding the broader cooperation arrangement will take the form of a Council Decision and a Joint Declaration providing up to EUR 25 million per year to Greenland on the basis of cooperation in other areas than fisheries.
The European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, on the other have with a view to replacing the Fisheries Agreement of 1985 [1] negotiated and initialled on 2 June 2006, a Fisheries Partnership Agreement which provides Community fishermen with fishing opportunities in waters in the exclusive economic zone of Greenland, together with a Protocol and Annex setting out the fishing opportunities, technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of Community vessels during the period of six years from its entry into force.
The financial contribution is fixed at EUR 15,847,244 per year including a financial reserve of EUR 1,540,000 which will be paid in case the Community receives fishing opportunities for cod and/or capelin in addition to the quotas already set out in the Annex.
