Amended proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights /* COM/2006/0168 final - COD 2005/0127 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 26.4.2006 COM(2006) 168 final 2005/0127 (COD) Amended proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROPOSAL This proposal for a Directive amends the proposal for a Parliament and Council Directive on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights (2005/0127 COD).
It puts into effect the Communication from the Commission of 23 November 2005 (COM(2005) 583 final) on the implications of the Court’s judgment of 13 September 2005 (Case C 176/03 Commission v Council).
It specifically mentions the proposal for a Parliament and Council Directive on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the proposal for a Council Framework Decision to strengthen the criminal law framework to combat intellectual property offences (COM(2005) 276 final).
The provisions in the proposal for a Framework Decision relating to penalties and extended powers of confiscation have now been incorporated in the new proposal for a Directive.
The Commission plans to take a horizontal approach to this subject under its Green Paper on conflicts of jurisdiction and the principle of ne bis in idem in criminal proceedings, adopted on 23 December 2005 [1] .
Since this objective may be better achieved at Community level, the Community may take measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
Commission statement 2005/295/EC on Article 2 of Directive 2004/48/EC lists these rights, with the aim of providing greater legal certainty regarding the scope of the Directive[3].
Article 2 This Article defines the concept of a legal person for the purposes of the Directive.
Article 3 This Article obliges Member States to consider all intentional infringements of an intellectual property right on a commercial scale as a criminal offence.
This does not affect specific liability systems such as the system laid down for Internet service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce[4].
Article 4 This article concerns the nature of penalties: besides imprisonment for natural persons, the Directive lays down a range of penalties to be imposed on both natural and legal persons, such as fines and the seizure of goods belonging to the offender, including the infringing goods and the materials, implements or media used predominantly for the manufacture or distribution of the goods in question.
It is the threshold selected in Joint Action 98/733/JHA and in the proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the fight against organised crime (COM(2005) 6 final) and in the United Nations Convention against Organised Transnational Crime.
For natural persons or legal entities who commit the offences listed in Article 3, the penalties include criminal and non-criminal fines to a maximum of at least EUR 100 000 for cases other than the most serious cases and to a maximum of at least EUR 300 000 for offences carried out under the aegis of a criminal organisation or which carry a health or safety risk.
Article 6 This article provides for the full or partial confiscation of goods belonging to persons convicted of offences committed in the circumstances set out in Article 5.
It refers to the provisions of Article 3 of Council Framework Decision 2005/212/JHA of 24 February 2005 on Confiscation of Crime-Related Proceeds, Instrumentalities and Property [5] .
Article 7 The Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 provides the structure needed to set up joint investigation teams.
Article 8 The purpose of this article is to ensure that investigations into, or prosecution of, counterfeiting and piracy offences are not dependent on a report or accusation made by a person subjected to the offence, at least if the acts were committed in the territory of the Member State.
Article 9 This Article concerns the measures for transposing the Directive into the internal law of the Member States.
Article 10 This Article lays down that the Directive enters into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal, pursuant to the provisions of Article 254(1) of the EC Treaty.
This causes a loss of confidence in the Internal Market in business circles, with a consequent reduction in investment in innovation and creation. (4) The Commission also adopted in November 2004, an Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Strategy towards third countries. (5)(2) Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights[11] lays down measures, procedures and civil and administrative remedies.
The Member States must ensure that the holders of intellectual property rights concerned, or their representatives, and experts are allowed to assist the investigations carried out by joint investigation teams. (9) To facilitate investigations or criminal proceedings concerning intellectual property offences, these may not be dependent on a report or accusation made by a person subjected to the offence. (10)(3)This Directive does not affect specific liability systems such as that laid down for Internet service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of Directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce[13]. (11)(4) As the objective of this Directive cannot be achieved adequately by the Member States acting alone and could better be achieved by action at Community level, the Community may take measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as declared by Article 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Article 2 Definition For the purposes of this Directive, “legal person” means any legal entity having such status under the applicable national law, except for States or any other public bodies acting in the exercise of their prerogative of public power, as well as public international organisations.
Article 3 Offences Member States shall ensure that all intentional infringements of an intellectual property right on a commercial scale, a nd attempting, aiding or abetting and inciting such infringements, are treated as criminal offences.
Article 4 Nature of penalties 1.
For the offences referred to in Article 3, the Member States shall provide for the following penalties: a) for natural persons: custodial sentences; b) for natural and legal persons: i) fines; ii) confiscation of the object, instruments and products stemming from infringements or of goods whose value corresponds to those products. 2.
Article 5 Level of penalties 3.
Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, when committed by natural persons or legal entities, the offences referred to in Article 3 are punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.
Article 7 Joint investigation teams The Member States must ensure that the holders of intellectual property rights concerned, or their representatives, and experts, are allowed to assist the investigations carried out by joint investigation teams into the offences referred to in Article 3.
Article 8 Initiation of criminal proceedings Member States shall ensure that the possibility of initiating investigations into, or prosecution of, offences covered by Article 3 are not dependent on a report or accusation made by a person subjected to the offence, at least if the acts were committed in the territory of the Member State.
Article 59 Transposal 5.
Article 610 Entry into force This Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 711 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
