The President of the Council is hereby authorised to carry out such procedures as may be necessary to give effect to paragraphs 1 and 2. 4.
The text of the Statute is attached to this Decision as Annex IV. 5.
Done at Luxembourg, 5 October 2006.
In respect of matters within the purview of the HCCH, the European Community notably has competence under Title IV of the EC Treaty to adopt measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications insofar as necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market (Articles 61(c) and 65 EC Treaty).
Furthermore, the European Community has competence in other fields which can be subject to conventions of the HCCH, as in the field of the internal market (Article 95 EC Treaty) or consumer protection (Article 153 EC Treaty). 5.
Thus, the Community Directives affected by the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Certain Rights of Securities held with an Intermediary were adopted on the basis of Article 95 of the EC Treaty. 6.
The European Community and its Member States will ensure that any change in the Community's competences will be promptly notified to the Secretary-General of the HCCH as stipulated in Article 2A(4) of the Statute.
