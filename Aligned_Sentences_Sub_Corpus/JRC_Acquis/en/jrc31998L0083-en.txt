This paragraph does not apply to the parameters for radioactivity, which, subject to Notes 8, 9 and 10 in Annex I, Part C, will be monitored in accordance with monitoring requirements adopted under Article 12.
A Member State may use the number of inhabitants in a supply zone instead of the volume of water to determine the minimum frequency, assuming a water consumption of 200 l/day/capita.
The lowest frequency applied must not be less than 50 % of the number of samples specified in the table except in the particular case of note 6.
Note 6: The frequency is to be decided by the Member State concerned.

Note 1: The composition of m-CP agar is: %gt%TABLE%gt% Dissolve the ingredients of the basal medium, adjust pH to 7,6 and autoclave at 121 °C for 15 minutes.
Note 5: Oxidation should be carried out for 10 minutes at 100 °C under acid conditions using permanganate.
Note 7: The performance characteristics apply to the individual substances specified at 25 % of the parametric value in Annex I.
Note 8: The performance characteristics apply to the individual substances specified at 50 % of the parametric value in Annex I. 3.
PARAMETERS FOR WHICH NO METHOD OF ANALYSIS IS SPECIFIED Colour Odour Taste Total organic carbon Turbidity (Note 1) Note 1: For turbidity monitoring in treated surface water the specified performance characteristics are that the method of analysis used must, as a minimum, be capable of measuring concentrations equal to the parametric value with a trueness of 25 %, precision of 25 % and a 25 % limit of detection.
