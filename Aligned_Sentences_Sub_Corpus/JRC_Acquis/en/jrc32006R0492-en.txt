Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC. (5) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation of the use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus aculeatus (CBS 589.94) and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Aspergillus oryzae (DSM 10287) for chickens for fattening and for piglets.
On 20 July 2005, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for the consumer, the user, the animal category or the environment.
EFSA delivered a favourable opinion with regard to the safety and to the efficacy of potassium diformate for all animal species on 8 December 2004.
