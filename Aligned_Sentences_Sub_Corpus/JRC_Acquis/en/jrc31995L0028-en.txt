Principle A sample is held horizontally in a U-shaped holder and is exposed to the action of a defined low-energy flame for 15 seconds in a combustion chamber, the flame acting on the free end of the sample.
Combustion chamber (figure 1), preferably of stainless steel and having the dimensions given in figure 2.
The combustion chamber is placed on four feet, 10 mm high.
Melted material is caught in a pan (see figure 3) which is placed on the bottom of the chamber between vent holes without covering any vent hole area. %gt%START OF GRAPHIC%gt% %gt%END OF GRAPHIC%gt% Figure 1 Example of combustion chamber with sample holder and drip tray %gt%START OF GRAPHIC%gt% %gt%END OF GRAPHIC%gt% Figure 2 Example of combustion chamber (Dimensions in millimetres) %gt%START OF GRAPHIC%gt% %gt%END OF GRAPHIC%gt% Figure 3 Typical drip pan (Dimensions in millimetres) 2.2.
Dimensions are given in figure 4.
A support shall be provided in the form of 0,25 mm diameter heat resistant wires spanning the frame at 25 mm intervals over the bottom U-shaped frame (see figure 5).
The plane of the lower side of samples shall be 178 mm above the floor plate.
The distance of the front edge of the sample holder from the end of the chamber shall be 22 mm; the distance of the longitudinal sides of the sample holder from the sides of the chamber shall be 50 mm (all inside dimensions). (See figures 1 and 2). %gt%START OF GRAPHIC%gt% %gt%END OF GRAPHIC%gt% Figure 4 Example of sample holder (Dimensions in millimetres) %gt% START OF GRAPHIC%gt% %gt%END OF GRAPHIC%gt% Figure 5 Example of section of lower U-frame design for wire support facility (Dimensions in millimetres) 2.3.
The gas supplied to the burner shall have a calorific value near 38 MJ/m³ (for example natural gas). 2.5.
Metal comb, at least 110 mm in length, with seven to eight smooth rounded teeth per 25 mm. 2.6.
Stop-watch, accurate to 0,5 seconds. 2.7.
The combustion chamber may be placed in a fume cupboard assembly provided that the internal volume is at least 20 times, but not more than 110 times, greater than the volume of the combustion chamber and provided that no single height, width, or length dimension of the fume cupboard is greater than 2 ½ times either of the other two dimensions.
Shape and dimensions 3.1.1.
The shape and dimensions of samples are given in figure 6.
When taking the sample permits, the sample shall have a constant section over its entire length. %gt%START OF GRAPHIC%gt% %gt%END OF GRAPHIC%gt% Figure 6 Sample (Dimensions in millimetres) 3.1.2.
If the shape and dimensions of a product do not permit taking a sample of the given size, the following minimum dimensions shall be maintained: (a) for samples having a width of 3 to 60 mm, the length shall be 356 mm.
When the material is supplied in widths, a length of at least 500 mm shall be cut covering the entire width.
When the thickness of the product is more than 13 mm, it shall be reduced to 13 mm by a mechanical process applied to the side which does not face the occupant compartment.
If it is impossible, the test shall be carried out, in accordance with the Technical Service, on the initial width of the material which shall be mentioned in the test report.
In the case of materials made of superimposed layers of different composition which are not composite materials, all the layers of material included within a depth of 13 mm from the surface facing towards the passenger compartment shall be tested individually. 3.3.
Conditioning The samples shall be conditioned for at least 24 hours but not more than 7 days at a temperature of 23 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of 50 ± 5 % and shall be maintained under these conditions until immediately prior to testing. 4.
Adjust the gas flame to a height of 38 mm using the mark in the chamber, the air intake of the burner being closed.
Before starting the first test, the flame shall burn at least for 1 min for stabilization. 4.4.
Push the sample-holder into the combustion chamber so that the end of the sample is exposed to the flame, and after 15 seconds cut off the gas flow. 4.5.
When running a series of tests or repeat tests, ensure that the combustion chamber and sample holder have a maximum temperature of 30 °C before starting the next test. 5.
Calculation The burning rate, B (1), in millimetres per minute, is given by the formula B = %gt%NUM%gt%s %gt%DEN%gt%t × 60 where: s is the burnt distance, in millimetres; t is the time, in seconds, to burn distance s. (1) The burning rate (B) for each sample is only calculated in the case where the flame reaches the last measuring point or the end of the sample.
The source of heat is an electric radiator with a useful output of 500 W.
The radiating surface must be made of a transparent quartz plate with a diameter of 100 ± 5 mm.
The target receiving radiation, and possibly to a small extent convection, shall be flat, circular, not more than 10 mm in diameter and coated with a durable matt black finish.
The target shall be contained within a watercooled body the front face of which shall be of highly polished metal, flat, coinciding with the plane of the target and circular, with a diameter of about 25 mm.
The instrument shall have an accuracy of within ± 3 % and a repeatability within 0,5 %.
Switch on the electricity supply and establish the power input of the controller required to produce irradiance at the centre of the radiator surface of 3 W/cm².
Adjustment to the power unit to record 3 W/cm² should be followed by a five minute-period without further adjustment to ensure equilibrium. 2.3.
On top of this support a grill, made of stainless steel-wire, is placed with the following dimensions: - interior diameter: 118 mm, - dimension of the holes: 2,10 mm square, - diameter of the steel-wire: 0,70 mm. 2.4.
The receptacle shall consist of a cylindrical tube with an interior diameter of 118 mm and a depth of 12 mm.
The receptacle shall be filled with cotton wool. 2.5.
A vertical column shall support the items specified in paragraph 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4.
When the thickness of the product is more than 13 mm, it shall be reduced to 13 mm by a mechanical process applied to the side which does not face the occupant compartment.
If it is impossible, the test shall be carried out, in accordance with the Technical Service, on the initial width of the material which shall be mentioned in the test report.
In the case of materials made of superimposed layers of different composition which are not composite materials, all the layers of material included within a depth of 13 mm from the surface facing towards the passenger compartment shall be tested individually.
The total mass of the sample to be tested shall be at least 2 g.
The samples and the cotton wool shall be conditioned for at least 24 hours at a temperature 23 ± 2 ° C and a relative humidity of 50 ± 5 % and shall be maintained under these conditions until immediately prior to testing. 4.
Procedure The sample is placed on the support and the latter is so positioned that the distance between the surface of the radiator and the upperside of the sample is 30 mm.
The receptacle, including the cotton wool, is placed beneath the grill of the support at a distance of 300 mm.
If the material melts or deforms, the height of the radiator is modified to maintain the distance of 30 mm.
