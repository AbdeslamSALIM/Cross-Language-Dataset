Regulations repealed and provisions deleted by that Regulation are to continue to apply to actions approved by the Commission under the Regulations concerned before 1 January 2000. (2) Transitional rules should facilitate the transition from existing support schemes to the new rural development support scheme in order to avoid any difficulties or delays in the implementation of rural development support during the period of transition. (3) Rural development support under Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 is to cover a programming period starting on 1 January 2000.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of new rules for agri-environment support, the specific transitional arrangements for agri-environment commitments must be applied as from 30 July 1999, the day after they were announced to Member States in the management committee.
Member States should also be authorised to make new agri-environment commitments before 1 January 2000 upon applications submitted before 30 July 1999 under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2078/92(2), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2772/95(3). (5) Payments arising from commitments made before 1 January 2000 in connection with rural development schemes, which in future are to be financed by the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF, should continue to be financed by the Guidance Section of the EAGGF until 31 December 2001 in accordance with existing support conditions and subject to funds available.
However, until 31 December 2001 multiannual expenditure arising from such commitments, as well as compensatory allowances relating at the latest to the year 1999, may under certain conditions be financed from the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF if no funds are available or the available funds are insufficient.
CHAPTER II Existing measures Article 2 The Commission shall not approve in the framework of Regulations repealed by Article 55(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 any measure or any amendment thereto whose duration extends beyond 31 December 1999, unless immediate approval is required for imperative reasons.
Member States may extend an agri-environment commitment made under Regulation (EEC) No 2078/92 terminating before the rural development programming document has been approved by the Commission by up to a maximum period of one year, but in no case extending beyond 31 December 2000.
In the case of support granted Council Regulations (EEC) No 1696/71(5), (EEC) No 404/93(6) and (EC) No 2200/96(7), as well as Council Regulations (EEC) No 4256/88(8), (EEC) No 1610/89(9), (EEC) No 867/90(10), (EC) No 950/97(11), (EC) No 951/97(12) and (EC) No 952/97(13), the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article shall apply. 2.
This report must be presented in accordance with the tables in Annexes I and II.
CHAPTER III New measures Article 6 Expenditure shall be eligible for support from the EAGGF Guarantee Section only if it has actually been paid to the individual beneficiary of a rural development support measure after 31 December 1999 and after the date on which the rural development plan or any amendment to that plan relevant for the measure concerned has been submitted or communicated to the Commission.
However, expenditure in respect of ex-ante evaluation shall be eligible for support according to Article 40 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1750/1999(14), if it has been paid after 31 July 1999.
Article 7 Member States may provide in their rural development plans that compensatory allowances may continue to be granted on the basis of livestock numbers for payments due in relation to the year 2000.
