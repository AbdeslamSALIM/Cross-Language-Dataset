Test mixture The test mixture shall be composed of: Silica sand of hardness 7 on the Mohr scale, with a grain size between 0 and 0,2 mm and an almost normal distribution, with an angular factor of 1,8 to 2; Water of hardness not exceeding 205 g/m3 for a mixture comprising 25 g of sand per litre of water. 2.
The mixture shall be sprayed until the variation in the diffusion of light on the sample or samples measured by the method described in appendix 2, is such that: Several reference samples may be used to check that the whole surface to be tested has deteriorated homogeneously. -------------------------------------------------- APPENDIX 4 ADHESIVE TAPE ADHERENCE TEST 1.
Leave the assembly in the specified atmospheric conditions for 10 minutes.
Unstick about 25 mm of the test piece from the plate in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the test piece.
Apply force in such a manner that the separation line between the tape and the plate is perpendicular to this force and perpendicular to the plate.
Pull to unstick at a speed of 300 mm/s ±30 mm/s and record the force required. 6.
This value shall be expressed in Newtons per centimetre of width of the tape. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX 7 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SAMPLING BY AN INSPECTOR 1.
This condition also applies to colour. 1.2.
Class A headlamps: no measured value deviates unfavourably by more than 20 per cent from the value prescribed in this Regulation. 1.2.2.
Class B, C and D headlamps: 1.2.2.1.
no measured value deviates unfavourably by more than 20 per cent from the value prescribed in this Regulation.
For values in zone III for Class B headlamp, zone I for Class C and D headlamp, the maximum unfavourable deviation may be respectively: 0,3 lux equivalent 20 per cent 0,45 lux equivalent 30 per cent 1.2.2.2.
and if for the driving beam, HV being situated within the isolux 0,75 Emax, a tolerance of +20 per cent for maximum values and –20 per cent for minimum values is observed for the photometric values at any measuring point specified in paragraphs 6.2.3.2 and 6.3.2.2 of this Regulation. 1.2.3.
