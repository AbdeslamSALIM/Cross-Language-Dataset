In 2004 the advice was that the stock size should be rebuilt to above 230 000 t in 2006 (a 24% increase).
The catching sector is made up of approximately 114 vessels from Belgium, 390 from the Netherlands, 11 beam trawlers from Denmark, 290 from Germany and 110 from the UK.
Plaice are an important species also in the catches of 375 Danish trawlers under 24 m and 95 seiners.
Based on an average crew levels of approximately five per vessel, this implies some 4 500 jobs at sea are directly dependent on the sole and flatfish stocks, and a further 2 400 are dependent on plaice for a part of their income.
Belgian beam-trawlers were loss-making in 2002 and 2003.
Smaller beam-trawlers achieved an operating profit margin of only 2.9% to 3.3% between 2001 and 2004.
Measures need to be taken to establish a multi-annual management plan for the stocks of plaice and sole in the North Sea, in conformity with Article 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002. 6.
Article 2 Objective of the Management plan 1.
The objective provided for in paragraph 1 shall be attained while maintaining the fishing mortality rate on plaice in the North Sea at a rate equal to or no lower than 0.3. 3.
The objective provided for in paragraph 1 shall be attained while maintaining the fishing mortality rate on sole in the North Sea at a rate equal to or no lower than 0.2.
CHAPTER IITotal Allowable Catches Article 3 Setting of Total Allowable Catches (TACs) 1.
The TAC for plaice shall be set in accordance with Article 4. 3.
The TAC for sole shall be set in accordance with Article 5.
Article 4 Procedure for setting the TAC for plaice 1.
The Council shall set the TAC for plaice at that level which, according to a scientific evaluation carried out by Scientific Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), is the higher of the following: (a) that TAC whose application would result in a 10% reduction in the fishing mortality rate in its year of application compared to the fishing mortality rate estimated for the preceding year; (b) that TAC whose application would result in a fishing mortality rate of 0.3 on ages 2 to 4 in its year of application. 2.
Where the application of paragraph 1 would result in a TAC which exceeds the TAC of the preceding year by more than 15%, the Council shall set a TAC which is 15% greater than the TAC of that year. 3.
Where the application of paragraph 1 would result in a TAC which is more than 15% less than the TAC of the preceding year, the Council shall set a TAC which is 15% less than the TAC of that year.
Article 5 Procedure for setting the TAC for sole 1.
The Council shall set a TAC for sole at that level which, according to a scientific evaluation carried out by STECF, is the higher of the following: (a) that TAC whose application would result in the same proportionate change in the fishing mortality rate on sole as is generated by the application of Article 4(1) concerning plaice; (b) that TAC whose application would result in a fishing mortality rate of 0.2 in its year of application; (c) that TAC whose application would result in a 10% reduction in the fishing mortality rate in its year of application compared to the fishing mortality rate estimated for the preceding year. 2.
Where the application of paragraph 1 would result in a TAC which exceeds the TAC of the preceding year by more than 15%, the Council shall set a TAC which is 15% greater than the TAC of that year. 3.
Where the application of paragraph 1 would result in a TAC which is more than 15% less than the TAC of the preceding year, the Council shall set a TAC which is 15% less than the TAC of that year.
CHAPTER IIIFishing effort limitation Article 6 Fishing effort limitation 1.
Each year, the Council shall decide by a qualified majority, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, on the maximum number of days at sea available for Community fishing vessels deploying beam trawl gear of mesh size equal to or greater than 80 mm and subject to the system of fishing effort limitation referred to in paragraph 1. 3.
Article 8 Margin of tolerance 1.
By way of derogation from Article 5(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2807/83, the permitted margin of tolerance, in estimation of quantities in kilograms live weight retained on board of Community fishing vessels that have been present in the North Sea shall be 8% of the figure entered in the logbook.
Paragraph 1 shall not apply concerning a species of aquatic organism if the quantity of that species retained on board is less than 50 kg.
Article 9 Weighing of landings The competent authorities of a Member State shall ensure in respect of landings made by any Community fishing vessel that has been present in the North Sea that: (a) all quantities of plaice and sole landed by any Community fishing vessel carrying on board any quantity of plaice exceeding 500 kg or of sole exceeding 300 kg are weighed; (b) the weighing of plaice and sole is carried out in the presence of controllers and before transportation from the point of landing and before first sale; (c) weighing is undertaken using scales that have been certified as accurate within a reasonable margin of tolerance by the competent authorities of the Member State.
Article 10 Prior notification 1.
The master of a Community fishing vessel that has been present in the North Sea and that carries on board more than 500 kg of plaice or more than 300 kg of sole shall, prior to any entry of his vessel into port or to any landing location of a Member State, inform the competent authorities of that Member State at least four hours in advance of such entry, of: (a) the name of the port or landing location; (b) the estimated time of arrival at that port or landing location; (c) the quantities in kilograms live weight of all species of which more than 50 kg is retained on board. 2.
The notification provided for in paragraph 1 may also be made by a representative of the master of the Community fishing vessel. 3.
The master of a Community fishing vessel that has been present in the North Sea and who wishes to tranship any quantity of plaice or sole retained on board or to land any quantity of plaice or sole in a port or a landing location of a third country shall inform the competent authorities of the flag Member State at least 24 hours prior to transhipping or to landing in a third country, of the information provided for in paragraph 1.
Article 11 Separate stowage of plaice and sole 1.
When quantities of plaice or of sole greater than 50 kg are stowed on board a Community fishing vessel that has been present in the North Sea, it shall be prohibited to retain on board that vessel in any container any quantity of plaice or of sole mixed with any other species of marine organisms. 2.
Article 12 Transport of plaice and sole By way of derogation from Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93, quantities bigger than 100 kg of any mixture of plaice and sole which are transported to a place other than that of landing or import shall be accompanied by a copy of one of the declarations provided for in Article 8(1) of that Regulation pertaining to the quantities of plaice and sole transported.
The exemption provided for in Article 13(4)(b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 shall not apply.
CHAPTER V Follow-up Article 14 Evaluation of management measures 1.
Article 15 Special Circumstances In the event that the STECF advises that either or both the spawning stock size of plaice or that of sole is suffering reduced reproductive capacity, the Council shall decide by qualified majority on the basis of a proposal from the Commission on a TAC for plaice that is lower than that provided for in Article 4, on a TAC for sole that is lower than that provided for in Article 5, and on a number of days at sea that is lower than that provided for in Article 6.
