Fulbright/European Union scheme | Year | Grant amount | Number of grantees | 2001 | 60.000 | 9 | 2002/2003 | 129.000 | 11 | 2004 | 100.000 | 8 | Totals | 289.000 | 28 | 3.
The evaluation work started in October 2004 and was carried out over a period of five months until the end of February 2005.
The Commission received the Final Evaluation Report on 4 March 2005.
RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION The independent evaluation concluded that the programmes are a powerful tool for establishing long-term transatlantic partnerships in higher education and vocational training.
Intervention logic The evaluators concluded that the programmes in their current format are coherent and are working well and that, in general, all the assumptions on which the programmes' intervention logic is built appear to be valid.
The Commission shares the evaluators’ analysis on this point. 4.2.
Evaluators concluded that students’ participation in the transatlantic exchanges will improve their international careers.
However, the programmes bring in a multilateral European Union dimension that bilateral agreements lack.
The evaluators concluded that the grant scheme plays a role in strengthening political and cultural ties between the European Union and the United States of America.
