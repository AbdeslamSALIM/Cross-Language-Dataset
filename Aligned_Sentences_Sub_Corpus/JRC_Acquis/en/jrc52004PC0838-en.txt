Meanwhile, the Council directives for negotiations on the revision of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement request to “ make the preparations necessary to pursue both options, integration and a 10th EDF ” and to complete the negotiations by 28 February 2005[2].
The Joint ACP-EU Council of Ministers in Gaborone on 7 May 2004 confirmed that, pending a decision on budgetisation, the Commission should propose a 10th EDF.
In conclusion, the Communication recommends that the Council (i) adopt the attached draft decision fixing 31 December 2007 as the date beyond which the 9th EDF funds will no longer be committed, and (ii) authorise the Commission to formally communicate to the ACP Group the financial package proposed for development finance cooperation under the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement under the future financial perspectives 2007-2013. 1.
INTRODUCTION The European Union maintains privileged trade and development cooperation relations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of developing countries through the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000 for a period of 20 years from 1 March 2000.
Taking the view that budgetisation of the EDF would further underpin the underlying objectives of the innovations in the Cotonou Agreement and of internal reforms in the organisation of the delivery of the European Commission’s aid to third countries, and that it would contribute to a more visible, coherent and effective European cooperation policy, in October 2003 the Commission submitted a communication to the Council and the Parliament on full integration of cooperation with the ACP and the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) in the EU budget.
The Joint ACP-EU Council of Ministers in Gaborone on 7 May 2004 confirmed that, pending a decision on budgetisation, the Commission should propose a 10th EDF.
EDF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The Cotonou Agreement specifies that the need for new resources must be based on an assessment of the degree to which the 9th EDF funds have been committed and disbursed and the date beyond which they will not be committed[7]. [pic] As shown in the table, the performance of the EDF in 2003 was its best ever.
On this basis the Commission proposes to fix 31 December 2007 as the date beyond which the remaining 9th EDF funds managed by the Commission and the interest subsidies managed by the EIB will not be committed. 3.
On the basis of the performance review, the Commission considers it highly probable that the consolidated 9th EDF funds, including the conditional billion, will effectively be fully committed by the end of 2007 as a result of the Community’s improved capacity for committing and disbursing EDF funds.
These reflections were further expanded in July 2004 in a communication to the Council and the Parliament on the Financial Perspectives 2007-2013[14].
The communication of 29 September 2004 on the Instruments for External Assistance under the Future Financial Perspectives 2007-2013 invites the Council and Parliament to adopt the proposed regulation on the Economic Cooperation and Development Cooperation instrument which will include the core activities of the present EDF, and to adopt the proposed regulation for the Stability instrument which also includes a contribution for actions which are currently financed under the EDF[15].
Under the 9th EDF the share of the OCT in the total EDF amount (€175 million, out of € 13 800 million) is 1,27%.
This relative share has been maintained for the Financial Perspectives 2007-2013[18].
The planning horizon of the financial perspectives 2007-2013 may possibly result in lengthening the programming cycle from 5 to 6 years[19].
There is therefore a prudential margin to take into account the usual delays and to correct the situation during the end of term review in early 2006 which will allow transferring funds from low to high performers. [34] The performance review will be further detailed and complemented by a qualitative performance assessment as part of the Communication on the release of the conditional billion.
