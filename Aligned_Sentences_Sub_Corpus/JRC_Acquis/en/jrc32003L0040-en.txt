It is therefore deemed necessary to establish concentration limits for these constituents in natural mineral waters. (2) Article 11 of Directive 80/777/EEC makes provision for adopting harmonised concentration limits for the constituents of natural mineral waters after consulting the Scientific Committee for Food, and for labelling requirements to indicate, where applicable, the presence of certain constituents at high concentrations. (3) The Scientific Committee for Food issued an opinion(3), on arsenic, barium, fluoride, boron and manganese and, for other constituents of natural mineral waters, validated the limits recommended by the WHO for drinking water. (4) The revised Codex standard for %quot%natural mineral waters%quot%(4), gives, for health purposes, a list of constituents and maximum limits for these constituents.
Article 3 For the purposes of official controls, the Member States shall comply with the specifications listed in Annex II for analysing the constituents listed in Annex I.
Natural mineral waters with a fluoride concentration exceeding 1,5 mg/l shall bear on the label the words %quot%contains more than 1,5 mg/l of fluoride: not suitable for regular consumption by infants and children under 7 years of age%quot%. 2.
Article 10 This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 11 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
