Brussels, 7 April 2005.
Voting: For: 67 Against: 68 Abstentions: 9 Point 8.2 Amend as follows: "The market potential of services remains largely untapped due to national requirements that are incompatible with the free provision of services.
has become essential because of: a) the internationalisation of trade, with the current WTO negotiations on services, b) the euro, which has increased competition and the need for a single market in services."

Voting: For: 68 Against: 85 Abstentions: 10 9.1.1 In the EESC's view, the European Commission should take a break from introducing new legislation to give the Member States sufficient time in particular to transpose the measures under the Financial Services Action Plan into national law and to check their effectiveness.
