The new recital 10 clarifies the way the nutrient profiles will be set and used.
It takes into account parts of amendments 1 and 10, whereas amendment 4 is partially taken into account in recital 11, which now precises that the Authority should advise the Commission for the setting of the nutrient profiles.
Nutrition claims Amendment 6 is included in recital 20, which states that the positive list of nutrition claims shall be revised “in order to take account scientific and technological developments”.
Amendment 42 proposes to allow all the claims that were prohibited in the article 11 of the original proposal, provided they are scientifically substantiated.
To take account of this new situation, recital 23 and 24 were redrafted by the Council, in line with amendments 7 and 8.
Amendments 43 and 93 ask for consultation of stakeholders and comitology for the adoption of guidelines for the implementation of the article 11 of the original proposal.
Amendment 44 proposes to delete the word “normal” before “functions”, in order to include in these function claims category normal and enhanced functions of the body.

The Council amended article 4 to better detail the principles of the nutrient profiles and the process steps to set them.
Furthermore, the Council extended the period to set the nutrient profiles from 18 months to 24 months.
New recital 12 excludes food supplements in liquid form containing more that 1.2% of alcohol from the scope of these restrictions, as the alcohol quantity provided by the consumption as such foodstuffs is negligible.
