Under Article 3 of Directive 89/48/EEC the Spanish authorities are required to allow any national of a Member State who holds the diploma required for pursuing a regulated profession in another Member State to take up and pursue that profession.
According to the facts set out by the Commission, (1) the profession of Road, Canal and Port Engineer is a regulated profession in Spain; (2) the complainants are nationals of a Member State; (3) the diploma required in Italy for taking up the profession of engineer is the Diploma de Laurea in Ingegneria Civile together with the Abilitazione all'esercizio della professione di ingegnere.
By refusing them access to the profession, the Kingdom of Spain has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 3 of the Directive.
