Review of the annexes to the Regulation 1.1.
The first review resulted in Regulation (EC) No 453/2003,[3] which transferred Ecuador from Annex II to Annex I.
For all these reasons, the Commission believes that there are good grounds, in view of the criteria in recital 5 to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, for proposing to transfer Bolivia from Annex II to Annex I.
It is accordingly proposed that Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and the Seychelles be transferred from Annex I to Annex II.
But the fact is that certain categories of people who are not Union citizens are in neither Annex I nor Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001.
It proposes that British Nationals (Overseas) be listed in Annex II.
They are attached to the territory of Hong Kong, and most of them also hold a Hong Kong SAR passport and are accordingly exempt from the visa requirement in the Member States.
British Nationals (Overseas) are readmissible in Hong Kong.
The purpose of Article 5(2) of the proposal is to draw that conclusion and to add British Nationals (Overseas) to Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001.
On the other hand, the Commission is proposing that British Overseas Territories Citizens (BOTC), British Overseas Citizens (BOC), British Subjects and British Protected Persons (BPP) be placed in Annex I.
Rules applicable to bearers of passports other than ordinary passports Under Article 4(1) of the Regulation, the Member States retain the possibility of exempting “holders of diplomatic passports, official-duty passports and other official passports”, while Annex 2 to the Common Consular Instructions (CCI)[7] refers to “holders of diplomatic, official and service passports”.
The distinction will also have to be made, of course, in Annex 2 to the CCI and the Table of travel documents.
Converting certain possibilities for the Member States to grant an exception to the visa requirement into harmonised exemption cases Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 as its stands provide for a number of possibilities for Member States to decide on exceptions to the visa requirement.
Recognised refugees and stateless persons Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 provides that recognised refugees and stateless persons “may be exempted from the visa requirement if the third country where they reside and which issued their travel document is one of the third countries listed in Annex II”.
It therefore proposes adding to Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 an automatic visa exemption for refugees and stateless persons resident in a Member State.
Article 1(2) of this proposal thus maintains in Article 4(2) of the Regulation the possibility of a visa exemption for school pupils residing in a third country listed in Annex II. 3.2.
Article 1(2) of this proposal thus maintains in Article 4(2) of the Regulation the possibility of a visa exemption for school pupils residing in a third country listed in Annex II. 4.
It therefore follows from the provisions of the 1951 and 1995 Agreements that members of the armed forces of the States that are parties to those agreements may travel without being subject to passport and visa regulations.
The date of application of the visa requirement for Bolivian nationals must be such as to allow Member States to rescind in good time the bilateral agreements with Bolivia and to take all the necessary administrative and organisational measures for introducing the visa requirement in question. (3) Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and the Seychelles must be transferred to Annex II.Exemption from the visa requirement for nationals of those countries should not come into force before a bilateral agreement on exemption from the visa requirement between the European Community and the country in question has been concluded. (4) The two annexes to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 must be exhaustive.
Various categories of “British” persons who are not nationals of the United Kingdom within the meaning of Community law should be added to Annex I to the Regulation and British Nationals (Overseas) should be added to Annex II. (5) The Member States may provide for exceptions to the visa requirement for holders of certain passports other than ordinary passports.
Reference needs also to be made in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 to the procedures applicable where recourse is had to such exceptions. (6) The Member States may exempt from the visa requirement recognised refugees and stateless persons residing in a third country listed in Annex II and school pupils travelling on school excursions who reside in one of those countries.
A full exemption from the visa requirement should be introduced for these two categories of person if they reside in a Member States. (7) The developments in the discussions on the introduction of local border traffic arrangements make it necessary to provide for a new exemption from the visa requirement for holders of a local border traffic card. (8) The arrangements governing exceptions to the visa requirement must fully reflect actual practices.
Article 1 is amended as follows: 2.
The following subparagraph is added to paragraph 1: “Without prejudice to the requirements stemming from the European Agreement on the Abolition of Visas for Refugees signed at Strasbourg on 20 April 1959, recognised refugees and stateless persons shall be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States if the third country in which they are resident and which has issued them with their travel document is a third country listed in Annex I.” 3.
The following subparagraph is added to paragraph 2: “The following shall also be exempt from the visa requirement: - the nationals of third countries listed in Annex I who are holders of a local border traffic card issued by the Member States pursuant to Regulation (EC) No ...... - school pupils who are nationals of a third country listed in Annex I and who reside in a Member State and are travelling in the context of a school excursion as members of a group of school pupils accompanied by a teacher from the school in question; - recognised refugees and stateless persons who reside in a Member State and are holders of a travel document issued by that Member State.” - Article 4 is amended as follows: - Paragraph (1)(a) is replaced by the following: “(a) holders of diplomatic passports, service/official passports or special passports in accordance with one of the procedures laid down in Articles 1(1) and 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 789/2001;”. 4.
