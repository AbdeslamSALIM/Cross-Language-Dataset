The cylindrical figure (see Annex III, figure 6) used for testing the gangway clearance shall then be moved starting from the gangway, in the probable direction of motion of a person leaving the vehicle, until its centre line has reached the vertical plane which contains the top edge of the uppermost step, or until a plane tangential to the upper cylinder touches the dual panel, whichever occurs first, and retained in that position (see Annex III, figure 2). 7.7.1.5.
This free space shall permit the free passage of a vertical panel whose form and dimensions are the same as the cylindrical form (paragraph 7.7.5.1), central section and a thickness of no more than 20 mm.
The free passage clearance for this figure shall not include any space extending to 300 mm in front of any uncompressed seat cushion of a forward or rearward facing seat or 225 mm in the case of seats fitted at wheel arches, and to the height of the top of the seat cushion. 7.7.1.7.
In the case of a folding seat, this space shall be determined with the seat in the position of use. 7.7.1.8.
However, a folding seat for use by the crew may obstruct the access passage to a service door when in the position of use provided that: 7.7.1.8.1.
when the seat is not in use it folds automatically as necessary to enable the requirements of paragraphs 7.7.1.1 or 7.7.1.2 and 7.7.1.3, 7.7.1.4 and 7.7.1.5 to be met; 7.7.1.8.3.
