Finally, waste treatment and disposal measures are also effective in reducing pollution.
Article 10 of the WFD sets out a “combined approach” involving the use of environmental quality standards (EQS).
In 1982, the Commission came forward with a list of 132 candidate List I substances.
Some EQS for water have been set at Community level in the past (see Section 1.3).
Option 3 made a number of assumptions in order to define specific EU-wide measures (including emission limit values) for the industries most affected, namely chemicals (mainly chlorine and pesticides), iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, PVC conversion, and refineries.
Consequently, Option 3 was ruled out because of the disproportionate costs.
If Member States provide sufficient evidence that additional measures are needed at Community level, there are various mechanisms under existing instruments that allow them to put this to the Commission as a basis for discussion. 2.3.
The estimated costs were approximately 700 million euros a year, considerably lower than for Option 3.
Action 1: Amending Directives A number of Directives are to be reviewed and amended in the 2006-2007 period, in particular Directives 96/61/EC and 91/414/EEC.
The Commission intends to use these reviews to assess whether these instruments can be made even more effective in preventing or controlling pollution caused by priority substances.
Such procedures could be based on Article 12 of the WFD and would specify the timetable, process and format for presenting evidence to the relevant committees or decision-making bodies under the instrument in question.
CONCLUSION The Water Framework Directive together with the current Commission proposal for a Directive on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy sets out clear, ambitious and sustainable objectives for priority substances in surface waters.
