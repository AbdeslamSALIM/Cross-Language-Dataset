For the Commission Joaquín Almunia Member of the Commission [1] OJ L 255, 30.9.2005, p. 1. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX I VARIABLES Note to the table: The value %quot%core%quot% and %quot%key%quot% in the column %quot%variable group%quot% are explained in Annex III.
The sample shall be stratified by NACE and size category according to the following minimum specification: - 20 NACE rev1.1 categories (C, D (15-16, 17-19, 21-22, 23-26, 27-28, 29-33, 34-35, 20 + 36-37), E, F, G (50, 51, 52), H, I (60-63, 64), J (65-66, 67), K + O) - 3 enterprise size categories, according to their number of persons employed: (10-49) (50-249) (250 and more) 3.
The following formula may be used in determining the sample size: nh = 1/[c2 .
teh + 1/Nh] / rh Where: nh = the number of sampling units in the stratum cell, h rh = the anticipated response rate in the stratum cell, h c = maximum length of half the confidence interval teh = the anticipated proportion of training enterprises in the stratum cell, h Nh = the total number of enterprises (training and non-training) in the stratum cell, h [1] OJ L 196, 5.8.1993, p. 1.
Regulation as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1). -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX III Imputation principals and record weighting Countries shall take all appropriate measures to reduce item and unit non-response.
When a record contains less than 50 % of variables presented then this record shall normally be considered as a unit non-response. 2.
For a single NACE/size cell imputations shall not be allowed if more than 50 % of the responding enterprises have missing data for more than 25 % of the quantitative variables. 3.
For a single NACE/size cell no imputation shall be performed on a quantitative variable if the proportion of responding enterprises for that particular variable is less than 50 %. 4.
For a single NACE/size cell no imputation shall be performed on a qualitative variable if the proportion of responding enterprises for that particular variable is less than 80 %.
These auxiliary variables should be recorded as the variables EXTRA1, EXTRA2, EXTRA3 as necessary.
The methodology adopted for establishing the weights shall be detailed in the quality report. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX IV Data file format and transmission rules Data shall be transmitted to the Commission (Eurostat) in electronic form by means of a secure data transmission software application (STADIUM/EDAMIS) to be made available by the Commission (Eurostat).
Subsequent records shall detail the values of these variables for each responding enterprise. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX V QUALITY REPORT FORMAT 1.
TIMELINESS AND PUNCTUALITY - Table of dates when each of the following phases of the project started and ended. - Data collection. - Sending out questionnaires. - Reminders and follow-up. - Face-to-face interviews. - Data checking and editing. - Further validation and imputation. - Non-response survey (as appropriate). - Estimations. - Data transmission to Eurostat. - Dissemination of national results. 4.
Tables to provide (broken down by NACE and size classes according to the national sampling plan, however allocation according to the observed enterprise characteristics): - Number of persons employed from Structural Business Statistics (Commission Regulation (EC) No 2700/98 [4] — code 16 11 0). - Number of persons employed from CVTS3. - Percentage of differences (SBS — CVTS3)/SBS. - Number of persons employed for each age group A3a,A3b,A3c. - Number of persons employed in other source for each age group. - Percentage of differences of (A3x — other national source A3x)/A3x (where x = a, b, c). - Number of CVT participants for each age group C2a,C2b,C2c. - Number of CVT participants in other source for each age group. - Percentage of CVT participants (C2x — other national source of C2x)/C2x (where x = a, b, c). 7.
The estimation of the sampling variance must take into account the sampling design and changes of strata. [2] The unit response rate is the ratio of the number of in scope respondents to the number of questionnaires sent to the population selected. [3] The item response rate for a variable is the ratio of the number of available data to the number of available and missing data (equal to the number of in scope respondents).
