The methods and procedures laid down incorporate those recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. 2.
Notes: a) Where a consignment is comprised of lots which can be identified as originating from different growers, etc., each lot should be considered separately.
Notes: a) Specific sampling devices are described by ISO(3)(4)(5) and IDF(6) standards.
SAMPLING PROCEDURES(7) 4.1.
Collection of primary samples The minimum number of primary samples to be taken from a lot is determined from Table 1, or Table 2 in the case of a suspect lot of meat or poultry.
Table 1 Minimum number of primary samples to be taken from a lot %gt%TABLE%gt% Table 2 Number of randomly selected primary samples required for a given probability of finding at least one non-compliant sample in a lot of meat or poultry, for a given incidence of non-compliant residues in the lot %gt%TABLE%gt% Notes: a) The table assumes random sampling.
b) Where the number of primary samples indicated in Table 2 is more than about 10 % of units in the total lot, the number of primary samples taken may be fewer and should be calculated as follows: %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% where n= minimum number of primary samples to be taken no= number of primary samples given in Table 2 N= number of units, capable of yielding a primary sample, in the lot.
Preparation of the bulk sample The procedures for meat and poultry are described in Table 3.
The procedures for plant products, eggs or dairy products are described in Tables 4 and 5.
Table 3 Meat and poultry: description of primary samples and minimum size of laboratory samples %gt%TABLE%gt% Table 4 Plant products: description of primary samples and minimum size of laboratory samples %gt%TABLE%gt% Table 5 Egg and dairy products: description of primary samples and minimum size of laboratory samples %gt%TABLE%gt% 4.4.
The minimum sizes required for laboratory samples are given in Tables 3, 4 and 5. 4.5.
The MRL applies to the bulk sample.
Where results for the bulk sample exceed the MRL, a decision that the lot is non-compliant must take into account: (i) the results obtained from one or more laboratory samples, as applicable, and (ii) the accuracy and precision of analysis, as indicated by the supporting quality control data.
