Following the 2001 crisis Member States requested reimbursement of 1616 million euro from the emergency veterinary fund.
It also shows that in the absence of comprehensive evaluation and inspections by the Commission before 2001, some weaknesses in the prevention and control arrangements were not corrected in time, especially as regards protective measures at borders, animal feed, contingency plans, sheep identification, and the messaging system concerning livestock movements between Member States (ANIMO).
The compensation paid to farmers by Member States was not always adequately defined at Community level, even though it was reimbursed at a rate of 60 % of the amount accepted as eligible by the Commission.
INTRODUCTION Background 1.
Countries that are free of the disease are obliged to put security measures in place, in order to protect themselves against the virus and avoid embargoes on their exports of animal products. 2.
The completion of the internal market within the Community was planned for January 1993.
In a 1989 report on Member States' policies for controlling FMD [2], the Commission noted that some Member States that did not practise preventive vaccination of livestock [3] could impose restrictions on trade in animals with Community partners that did vaccinate.
In order to remove veterinary and similar obstacles to the development of intra-Community trade in animals and animal products the Commission considered health regulations applicable to international trade in animals and animal products, such as those laid down by the Office international des Epizooties (OIE) [4].
Because of these commercial considerations, the same Commission report concluded that the adoption of a non-vaccination policy was preferable to a policy of preventive vaccination.
This was why the stamping-out policy was supplemented at Community level, in 1990 [5], by the ban on preventive vaccination and by prohibition of imports of vaccinated animals into Community territory.
However, it was still possible to vaccinate, but only as an emergency measure when the presence of FMD had been confirmed and there was a danger of large-scale spread of the disease. 5.
Since the adoption of this new strategy there have been several outbreaks in the Union, in Italy in 1993 (57 outbreaks) and in Greece, in 1994, 1996 and 2000 (95, 39 and 14 outbreaks respectively).
There were 2034 outbreaks of infection extending to 10124 farms and leading to the slaughter of some four million animals [6].
Main characteristics of measures to prevent and control FMD 6.
A complex set of prevention and control measures aims to limit the risk of the virus being introduced into the Community territory and spreading (see Box 1).
Box 1 Community measures for prevention and control of FMD The system of prevention focuses on collaboration with international organisations and substantial support for neighbouring countries in combating the disease, on veterinary, zootechnical and health controls on stock farming and meat in the Union and at its frontiers, the drafting of contingency plans by the Member States, with the resources needed to counteract any crisis that might arise, and systems for identifying and tracing animals.The control system relies on immediate notification of the disease, introduction of restrictions on movements of people and animals, the launch of epidemiological inquiries to identify animals suspected of being contaminated, and on Member States applying their contingency plans and implementing the necessary culls, followed by destruction of the carcases and disinfection of contaminated premises and materials. 7.
Impact on the budget 8.
The conditions applicable to the Community financial contribution to the expenditure for eradicating certain serious contagious animal diseases, including FMD, were laid down in 1990 by the Council [12].
The contribution is compulsory if the Member States have implemented the prescribed Community measures and takes the form of reimbursement, at a rate of 60 %, of FMD expenditure incurred by Member States in compensating farmers for the slaughter and destruction of animals and disinfection of premises and equipment.
Following the adoption of the new strategy the appropriations for the Fund, for all animal diseases together, were increased fourfold in 1999 and were doubled in 2000, reaching a grand total of 978,1 million euro for financial years 2001, 2002 and 2003 [15], mainly due to the 2001 FMD crisis.
For the 2001 crisis alone the overall total expenditure declared by Member States for compensation for slaughter and destruction of animals as well as disinfecting of farms and equipment was around 2693,4 million euro, of which 1616 million euro was claimed for Community reimbursement.
The total declared for slaughter compensation alone was 1775,1 million euro, of which 1065,2 million was claimed for reimbursement (see Table).

Following its decisions to grant aid [17] in connection with FMD, the Commission allowed payments to Member States for a total of 433,5 [18] million euro for slaughter expenditure and 32,1 million euro for other costs, bringing the total Community reimbursement to 465,6 million euro at 31 December 2003 (see Diagram 1).

Expenditure of around 2,5 million euro for FMD in Greece in year 2000 has been included in "Other diseases".
Source: Commission 11.
As a consequence, the budget appropriations available for the emergency veterinary fund were under-utilised by more than 48 % for financial years 2001 to 2003 (see Diagram 2).

Around 2,5 million euro has been included under the heading "Other diseases", for FMD expenditure for year 2000 in Greece.
This examination was confined to the expenditure on compensation for the slaughter of animals [24].
Lastly, the Court undertook a review of the lessons learned by the Commission after the 2001 crisis. 15.
In the 1989 report [28] mentioned above (see paragraph 2), the Commission carried out a cost-benefit analysis of the various policies followed by the Member States in controlling FMD (policy of preventive vaccination, or policy of systematic slaughter), with a view to defining the strategy to be followed at Community level.
The Commission projected the costs over a period of 10 years (from 1993 to 2002) according to three different scenarios for the scale of the crises.
For the non-vaccination policy it used an intermediate scenario with 13 epidemics of 20 outbreaks.
The estimated cost over the same period was 35 million euro.
The estimate for the cost of the optimistic scenario, on the other hand, was 0,3 million euro, and that for the worst scenario was 955 million euro. 17.
Moreover, the main emphasis of the 1989 report was on commercial considerations and consideration of budgetary and agricultural costs and profits, without taking into account the wider social and environmental costs. 18.
There had, in fact, been three epidemics that involved more than 20 outbreaks (the maximum possible in the scenario used by the Commission), but on the other hand, there had only been four crises in eight years (compared with thirteen in ten years according to the same scenario).
On the other hand, a number of risks conducive to the spread of the virus had increased since 1993: the number of livestock movements had increased [29] with the completion of the single market, the number of abattoirs had fallen [30], leading to increased concentrations of animals and an enhanced risk of infection, while stocking densities, particularly of sheep, goats and pigs, had soared [31].
In the period preceding the 2001 crisis the inspections required by the regulations should have focused, in the Court's opinion, on the essential measures for preventing and controlling FMD that are defined in Community directives and with the transposition of them into the national law of the Member States.
As regards the directive on animal identification, and identification of sheep in particular, which Member States were to transpose by 1 January 1995, the Commission had sent warnings to Member States for not communicating national measures between 1993 and 1996.
Between 1994 and 1997 it archived the files, following formal transposition of the Community law in the Member States, without making a compliance check.
During the 2001 crisis, however, the HVO pointed out that in all the Member States affected by FMD (apart from the Netherlands) there were significant omissions regarding the Directive and they had had a negative impact on the spread of the epidemic in 2001 (see paragraph 35).
Before the crisis the Commission had proposed that introduction into the Community territory be limited to products of animal origin, which meet European animal health standards, but the proposal was only adopted in 2002 [39].
Not until November 2002, after the crisis, did the Commission propose reinforcing controls on imports of products of animal origin intended for personal consumption.
Delays in imposing controls and banning the use of catering waste for animal feed 26.
The HVO inspections concerning animal feed were carried out late, partly after the crisis.
At the Community level, the use of processed catering waste in pig feed was still legal in February 2001 [41], despite the Commission's proposals. 28.
It went on to say, "At the time of the 2001 crisis – apart from the assessments in connection with the approval of the contingency plans – [the Commission] had still not reviewed the implementation either of the UK's contingency plan or of those of the Netherlands or France" [47]. 32.
In line with the Commission's guidelines it did not make provision for a pessimistic scenario [48] and even in the national plan, the basis for plans at local level, the scenario only covered up to ten outbreaks at any one time [49], without establishing any procedures for rapidly increasing the resources needed to handle culling and destruction.
The Irish contingency plan envisaged dealing with ten outbreaks at any one time.
Only the Netherlands had learned from the swine fever crisis and had provided for the necessary resources to be increased to deal with its 26 outbreaks by introducing emergency vaccination as soon as the resources were found to be insufficient to carry out culling immediately. 34.
Although the Commission responded rapidly during the crisis (see paragraph 44), the Court considers that good groundwork by the Commission, especially from the point of view of the financial arrangements for the reimbursement to be granted to Member States (see paragraphs 74 to 81), would have made it possible to avoid some of the problems encountered during the 2001 crisis.
At Community level there is a compulsory system for identifying and registering cattle individually [50].
In the case of sheep (the species mainly affected by the 2001 crisis) and pigs, identification was compulsory from 1 January 1995 until November 2003, but only for batches of animals [52].
During the crisis the HVO pointed out that the system of batch identification had been poorly applied in three out of the four Member States affected by FMD [53]. 36.
In the United Kingdom sheep that should have been slaughtered were not killed, so adding to the risk of the virus spreading. 37.
In the Netherlands, for example, the responsible authority discovered in the course of the epidemic that 18000 small holdings or individuals with only a very small number of animals were neither registered nor known, constituting an additional risk that it might not be possible to trace in time all the animals that had to be slaughtered.
Uncorrected deficiencies in the ANIMO system before the crisis 38.
In 1990, the Community rules [55] introduced a computerised system linking veterinary authorities, one of the main aims being to facilitate exchange of information on animal movements between the competent authorities of the regions of origin and the responsible authorities in the Member State of destination.
This system is called ANIMO [56].
Before the 2001 crisis the HVO had already pointed out that the ANIMO messages contained no mention of the transit points used during the transport of animals between a Member State of consignment and a Member State of destination.
During the 2001 crisis, following the confirmation of the first outbreak in the United Kingdom, the other Member States did indeed need to trace the sheep that they had imported from that country over the previous month, in order to be able to increase surveillance of animals that were potentially carrying the virus.
During the 2001 crisis these two omissions caused delays in locating and slaughtering animals suspected of being contaminated (see Box 2).
The ministry of agriculture in the Netherlands told the Court that compulsory details of transit points would have made control of the disease much more effective, especially during the critical initial phase of the crisis.
Box 2 Court identified problems with tracing animals During the crisis the authorities in the United Kingdom experienced problems in tracing the farms of origin for sheep exported to other Member States and determining whether the sheep were from contaminated farms, because that information was not given in the ANIMO messages.
Due to the lack of adequate information the Member States of destination had to carry out preventive culling of all sheep identified as having been imported from the United Kingdom, as it was impossible to differentiate between suspect sheep and others.The absence of a trail for the sheep was evidence of the difficulties experienced by the responsible authorities in France in tracing the French farms that were the ultimate destination of sheep imported from the United Kingdom.
Directive 85/511/EEC requires immediate imposition of restrictions on animal movements in protection and surveillance areas of a minimum radius of 10 km around infected farms, in order to limit the risks of an epidemic spreading.
These measures were implemented in the United Kingdom, but the restrictions alone could not contain the spread of the epidemic in view of the extent of contamination before the first outbreak had even been detected. 43.
According to the NAO report, another 62 premises were believed to have been infected in seven other counties in the interval between confirmation of the first outbreak and the introduction of the ban on livestock movements in the United Kingdom [59], with an increase in the scale of the epidemic (and, therefore, its cost) which university epidemiologists estimated to be twice what it would have been had restrictions been imposed on the same day that the disease was confirmed [60].
Some deficiencies which the HVO had found in the control arrangements in the United Kingdom (the country most affected by the crisis) could not, however, be dealt with promptly, because they required fundamental revision of the measures in question by the Commission and the Member States.
The main ones are: (a) a significant shortage of government vets, (b) the effectiveness of the control arrangements relied on farmers notifying the disease immediately, (c) in some cases, unacceptable delays in identifying suspected cases, confirming them and slaughtering and disposing of the animals in question [61]. 47.
Reduced veterinary services 48.
Statistics show [66] that the United Kingdom had 9,5 government vets per million animals (cattle, sheep and pigs), compared with an average of more than 20 vets per million animals for the other Member States.
Due to the reduction in the number of government vets in the United Kingdom and the delay in calling up additional manpower [67], the effectiveness of measures to control the epidemic was significantly reduced.
The disease was detected approximately one month after its appearance in another region, by which time, according to estimates made since then, there were already 57 contaminated holdings [69].
In the meantime (between 1 February 2001 and 21 February 2001), however, 49796 head of livestock had been exported to the other Member States, increasing the risk of the epidemic spreading beyond the frontiers of the United Kingdom. 53.
This compulsory notification of the disease by the Member State concerned to the Commission and the other Member States is, moreover, a requirement [70].
The Commission then immediately informed the veterinary services in the other Member States and, on the following day, stopped exports from the United Kingdom.
In the intervening period around 287 pigs were still exported from Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic, before the export ban was actually implemented, at 17.00 hours on 21 February. 55.
Delays in culling 57.
Box 3 Culling delays in Member States In the United Kingdom, as allowed by the Community regulations, the responsible authority waited for laboratory confirmation of infection before culling the animals from the first outbreak: in the meantime three other outbreaks had occurred.
In 78 % of such cases subsequent tests confirmed the vets' diagnosis (see NAO report, Table 38, p. 63).In the other Member States, on the other hand, slaughter took place as soon as an outbreak was suspected, before the final results of laboratory tests were received.
In the Netherlands, France and Ireland preventive culls were carried out, especially in the case of sheep imported from the United Kingdom.In the United Kingdom animals were killed after they had been valued and after the valuation had been accepted by the farmer, thus delaying slaughter of infected animals.
In December 2000 the Council [74] made the Commission alone responsible for direct management of this expenditure.
The latter are authorised to pay the objective current market value for each animal, established on the basis of a system of objective individual evaluation approved by them.
Variations in compensation systems and lack of uniformity in valuations 62.
Price references were unavailable for some categories of animals. 63.
As regards indirect losses [77] there was no compensation in three Member States (Ireland, Netherlands, United Kingdom), leaving farmers without resources for at least three weeks after animals had been slaughtered, while the farm was being decontaminated.
However, the Commission did not accept them for reimbursement. 64.
Box 5 Compensation systems introduced by Member States The compensation system chosen by the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands was based on the value of the animals, excluding indirect losses, whereas France included the latter, thus supplementing the animal value by around 30 %.In the United Kingdom the system fluctuated between one where valuers alone assessed the value of the animals and a mixed system where farmers could opt for either a valuation based on a standard rate card or a value set by the valuers.
Valuers were not given precise guidelines, and instructions on including outstanding animal premiums in the compensation figure were imprecise, leading to variations in the practices followed.In Ireland the responsible authority produced a monthly list of precise prices for all categories of cattle.
In the absence of detailed Community regulations the systems introduced in the Member States resulted in lack of uniformity in the compensation to farmers.
In other cases the compensation was reduced (Netherlands).
The average compensation paid to farmers was noticeably higher in the United Kingdom for cattle and sheep than in the other Member States, while in France it was higher for pigs (see Box 6 and Diagram 3).
Box 6 Compensation paid by Member States In the United Kingdom the compensation paid was high: the National Audit Office reported that the standard rate card used to value animals during part of the crisis was based on the highest prices prevailing just before the crisis.
The Commission has calculated that the average compensation paid for cattle was more than twice their value, more than 2,5 times value for sheep and almost twice value for pigs, resulting in an over-valuation (811,7 million euro) of the amount declared by the responsible authority.In the case of France the Commission estimated that 1,1 million euro of the amount declared was attributable to the over-valuation of animals, mainly because the compensation included indirect losses and the valuations for pigs were too high.In Ireland and the United Kingdom additional amounts (0,5 million euro and 1,7 million euro respectively) were paid to farmers who disputed valuations, but the amount of compensation paid was not cut in cases where the responsible authority found the valuation too high.
However, given that valuers had been instructed to include the amount of the premiums in the livestock valuations and that some of them had given direct confirmation of the inclusion, the Court was able to estimate that the total for animal premiums [81] paid to the United Kingdom in duplication of those included in the FMD compensation could be of the order of 10 million pounds sterling (more than 16 million euro) [82]. 71.
In Ireland as well, the Court identified cattle premiums that had been paid in addition to compensation, but the amounts were smaller [83].
The agriculture ministry in the Netherlands, on the other hand, told the Court that it had not included any premiums in the FMD compensation.
Variations in slaughter premium payments 72.
This led to inequality in the treatment of farmers within Member States, according to where slaughter took place. 73.
The Netherlands, where a significant part of the culling was carried out in abattoirs, did not pay slaughter premiums to farmers in addition to FMD compensation, thereby making a saving for the Community budget of some 3,5 million euro.
On the other hand, in Ireland, where part of the culling was also carried out in abattoirs, the premiums were paid; they were recovered, however, after the Court's audit visit.
Rules and procedures governing eligibility of Member States' expenditure for Community reimbursement were defined late 74.
Before the crisis, the Commission had not made any proposals for procedures for implementing the Community financial contribution, despite the undertaking it had given earlier in response to the follow-up of the Court's 1995 Annual Report, "to issue guidelines to the Member States concerning both procedures and the calculation of compensation with regard to Community co-financing of veterinary measures" (see Box 4).
Similarly, in the absence of Commission instructions, the Member States' requests for reimbursement included compensation paid to farmers who had not complied with national provisions implementing the Community directives on notification and movement restrictions (some 972876 euro in the United Kingdom and 58769 euro in France, see paragraph 56). 78.
Even though many of these shortcomings can be attributed to the scale of the crisis, fuller contingency plans (see paragraphs 30 to 32) and more precise Commission criteria could have reduced the importance of them.
As the Commission itself said, in its reply to this paragraph, it had not made any substantial changes to the eligibility rules contained in Decision 90/424/EEC since 1990.
Box 7 Criteria and documents needed for reimbursement to take place were specified ex post facto Protective culling in the Member States that had imported sheep from the United Kingdom the month before the crisis: in France there was reimbursement for the animals slaughtered, even though there was no Commission decision on the reimbursement.Partial protective culling around outbreaks in Ireland, France and the United Kingdom (3 km slaughter zone in Cumbria gave rise to expenditure to a sum total of some 112,3 million euro); reimbursement decisions were adopted by the Commission in July 2002 for France, in December 2003 for the United Kingdom and Ireland and, at the time when this report was being drafted, were still being finalised in the case of the Netherlands.Protective culling by Member States where there had been no outbreaks (Belgium, Germany, Spain and Portugal): the decision was not adopted by the Commission until August 2003, almost two years after the end of the crisis [88].Decisions on the financing of associated costs, with details of the information to be supplied to the Commission (veterinary costs, destruction costs, disinfecting costs): were not adopted until 2003 [89]. 80.
Delays in reimbursing Member States' expenditure 82.
This was why, as of 1 October 2003, more than two years after the end of the epidemic, neither Ireland, the Netherlands nor the United Kingdom had received any Community reimbursements, even though as a general rule farmers had received compensation within three months, after the culls in 2001.
Council Decision 90/424/EEC specifies that the Community contribution is equal to 60 % of the eligible costs incurred by the Member State in controlling FMD (see Table). 85.
For other animal diseases, including swine fever, it is 50 %.
The study quantified agriculture-related benefits in Ireland as some 107 million euro for 2001, essentially due to the increase in the volume and prices of exports to the United Kingdom. 88.
In the Netherlands, following the classical swine fever crisis, an animal health fund was set up, to pay compensation in the event of an epidemic.
COMMISSION MANAGEMENT AFTER THE CRISIS Action in the veterinary field 90.
Complementary measures were adopted at the same time, to reinforce the prevention and control measures: (a) as regards border controls, additional precautions were adopted by the Commission after the crisis, reinforcing checks on travellers' luggage and providing information to travellers [99]; (b) on the basis of earlier Commission proposals, a ban on the warehousing in free zones of products that do not meet Community veterinary requirements was adopted after the crisis [100]; (c) as regards animal feed, the Commission had already proposed a generalised ban on the use of kitchen waste and swill before the crisis [101]; it succeeded in obtaining the adoption of its proposals at EU level; (d) after the crisis the Commission introduced a proposal for individual identification of sheep [102], which was adopted in December 2003 [103]. 92.
Moreover, as was the case for classical swine fever [104], the Commission has not updated its initial study, even though some of the data that were missing at the time have become available since the 2001 crisis [105].
This is a significant factor, in as far as the policy change that has been made at Community level gives emergency vaccination more importance than it had before. 95.
At the time of the audit the Court pointed out that a number of countries, some of which had concluded veterinary agreements with the Community, continued to block exports from the EU after the countries concerned had recovered their disease-free status [106]. 96.
In a memorandum of April 2002 [108], the Spanish Presidency of the Council stated that agricultural insurance programmes in the livestock farming sector could provide an alternative solution to the mechanisms that are currently covered by the Emergency Fund.
Following that memorandum, and earlier recommendations by the Court and the discharge authority (see paragraph 59 and Box 4), the Commission, in January 2003, ordered a study on insurance against the risks associated with animal diseases. 99.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 101.
The omissions of the Community regulations were not corrected before the 2001 crisis, although some Commission proposals predated the crisis (see paragraphs 18 to 43).
Moreover one Member State had its disease-free status officially withdrawn for 11 months under the OIE animal health code, while the Union, for all practical purposes, lost that status for over a year in that its exports were blocked by non-member countries. 103.
The audit revealed that the effectiveness of the control arrangements relied heavily on farmers notifying the disease immediately and complying with movement restrictions. 104.
The Court also found that the system of funding could be further improved: the scope of compensation and reimbursement is poorly defined, some Member States have still not been reimbursed, and treatment of farmers varies, depending on the location of the holding or the method of slaughter (see paragraphs 60 to 73).
Since then, the Council and the Commission have remedied many of the omissions in the legislation (see paragraphs 90 and 91).
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg on 21 July 2004.
The FMD crisis necessitated a transfer of 400 million euro in addition to the initial appropriations of 41 million for the Fund for 2001, a supplement of almost 10 times the initial amount.
For financial years 2001, 2002 and 2003, the final appropriations entered in the budget reached a total of 978,1 million euro.

Despite the weaknesses detected in the application of the system (see Special Report No 6/2004 on the cattle identification and registration system), it would have been possible for lists of cattle present on farms to be printed and used by vets and valuers to verify animals' history, slaughter them and establish their value.

Directive 90/423/EEC, amending Directive 85/511/EEC on control measures for FMD, sets up a comprehensive system for the prevention, control and eradication of the disease.
As far as an assessment of the Commission's action before the crisis is concerned, the report of the British National Audit Office on FMD notes under 9c: "if contingency plans were not sufficient to deal with an outbreak on this scale, it is unrealistic to expect that any could have coped with all the problems and difficulties that arose or that the authorities could have forecast the unprecedented nature of the 2001 outbreak".
The Commission invites the Court to consider the declarations of the Council during the crisis, as well as the conclusions of the International Conference on the prevention and control of FMD held on 12 and 13 December 2001 in Brussels.
By placing more emphasis on emergency vaccination in the event of major epidemic diseases (CSF, bluetongue, AHS, FMD) Community legislation provides for the instruments to limit the direct costs of disease control measures.
Decision 90/424/EEC provides a sensible incentive for producers to notify animals showing suspicious clinical signs at the earliest opportunity (see also paragraph 92).
In agreement with the request of the European Parliament, the Commission launched a study on existing compensation schemes in Member States and received the final report in October 2003.
In preparation for the single market, the Council adopted Directives 89/662/EEC and 90/425/EEC laying down the veterinary controls on intra-Community trade in products of animal origin and live animals.
However, animals move from one Member State to another under clearly established conditions to be certified by an official veterinarian at the place of dispatch.
In the context of the disease control measures relating to the 2034 confirmed outbreaks of FMD in the United Kingdom, the animals of over 8000 premises were killed and destroyed as dangerous contacts, contiguous or on suspicion.
The 2001 FMD epidemic had a significant impact on animal husbandry in the whole of the EC in spite of taking all possible measures to continue trade in safe products with the affected Member States and commencing for the United Kingdom a carefully operated phasing out of the restrictions in October 2001, well before it was recognised as free of the disease by the OIE in January 2002 (see also paragraph 102).
The Commission wishes to clarify that the outbreaks in France (a total of two outbreaks, the first of which was detected on 13 March 2001) and the outbreaks in the Netherlands (a total of 26 outbreaks, the first of which was detected on 21 March 2001) are related to the movement of incubating sheep from the United Kingdom prior to the adoption of Decision 2001/145/EC. 6.
Various additional measures were also adopted by the Council, reinforcing identification and traceability of animals, exchange of information, and controls on introduction of products of animal origin, and the Commission adopted Decisions to support the FMD-control measures in neighbouring countries.
The underspend is entirely related to the year 2002, for which EUR 400 million were entered in the budget.
However, only EUR 50,8 million were committed because the United Kingdom, which should have been the main beneficiary, was unable to submit its request for reimbursement of the operational costs until 2003.
The time taken for the Commission to conduct its checks is a result of the intensive nature of its audit, which resulted in applications for EUR 583 million of the total of EUR 1051 million being rejected.
COMMISSION ACTION BEFORE THE CRISIS 16.
The ban on prophylactic vaccination came into force on 1 January 1992.
However, most Member States that had practised prophylactic vaccination ceased doing so during 1991.
The central case scenario described in the 1989 report estimates, for a 10-year period without vaccination, i.e. 1993 to 2002, a total of 273 outbreaks, with 13 primary outbreaks related to unknown sources and 20 secondary outbreaks for each primary outbreak.
The best case scenario is based on 13 primary outbreaks related to unknown sources without subsequent secondary infection.
The worst case scenario describes, for a 10-year period without vaccination, a total of 1963 outbreaks resulting from the above 13 primary outbreaks and 150 secondary outbreaks for each of them. 17.
Social and environmental issues had been included in the Community policy only following the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992, and could therefore not have been included explicitly in a study carried out prior to that date.
However, the report reflects on certain direct social consequences and on the effects of the non-vaccination policy on vaccine production plants, laboratories and veterinarians.
The strategy review started in 1998 when Council Directive 2001/89/EC was being prepared in the wake of the classical swine fever epidemic in 1996/1997 and was continued in 2002 in particular under a proposal for a new Directive on FMD (2003/85/EC, COM(2002) 736 Final).
The recently adopted provisions of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 on official controls performed to ensure verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules establish a new legal framework whereby the role of the Commission's departments is more focused on ascertaining that appropriate and reliable controls systems are in place and effectively managed at Member State level.
The closing of files opened following non-transposal of legislation does not, of course, prevent compliance of national provisions with Community directives being examined or a subsequent procedure being opened. 24.
Between 1998 and 2000, the FVO carried out 47 missions in relation to veterinary Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) in the Member States.
Concerning the incompleteness of its legislation existing in 2001, notably in relation to passenger luggage and free warehouses, the Commission makes the following point: Council Directive 90/675/EEC introduced, in modification of the Commission's proposal, provisions for controls on the storage of non-EC standard products of animal origin in free warehouses and free zones.
Article 16 of Directive 97/78/EC allows derogation from the veterinary controls for small quantities of products of animal origin for personal consumption that originate in third countries listed for such imports, but does not exclude customs controls to verify these facts.
In 2000 the Commission proposed to the Council a Directive (COM(2000) 438), later adopted as Council Directive 2002/99/EC, that requires all products introduced onto Community territory to comply with the Community animal health requirements, regardless of the customs procedure. 26.
Work on laying down criteria at Community level started in 1991 and continued in 1999.
In 2001 all the criteria were used to assess whether it was advisable to carry out emergency vaccination in the Member States requesting it.
The measures provided for in the plans may have a serious impact on the economic and social situation of the rural community and the national economy as a whole.
The recommendation by the Commission in 1995 was that any veterinary service had to provide the capacity for the instant control of 10 [5] simultaneous outbreaks, with an option to expand should the epidemiological situation so require.
It is important to note that the situation in the United Kingdom, with infection already seeded in more than 50 premises prior to the confirmation of the first outbreak, cannot be compared with the situation in other affected Member States that had a sufficient period of warning. 35.
Following difficult discussions in the Council and the European Parliament, in 2003 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 which requires individual identification of sheep and goats and record keeping on the registered farms. 37.
Difficulties have been encountered in relation to triangular trade in fattening sheep forwarded from the Member State of first destination to another and accompanied by a new certificate recorded in a new ANIMO message.
In other cases tracing of sheep was hampered when the sheep originating in the United Kingdom had been moved under national conditions from the holding of destination indicated in the ANIMO message to another holding within the same Member State. 41.
On 19 February 2001 the disease was noticed in sows at the abattoir in Essex and subsequently confirmed on 20 February 2001.
Tracing to source farms led on 21 February 2001 to the conclusion that the abattoir was contaminated before these animals had arrived.
On 23 February 2001 the disease was reported in cattle on a holding from where sheep had been sent to a big livestock market days before.
Eight out of the nine areas, which account for 89 % of the outbreaks diagnosed by 15 June 2001, were infected before the first case of FMD was diagnosed.
COMMISSION ACTION DURING THE CRISIS 44.
The responsible services in the Commission have been and are available 24/24 not only during crisis situations, as can be gathered from the rapid response to the notification of the first outbreak. 45.
The responsibility of the food chain operators, including livestock keepers, has been clarified in Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 which was based on a Commission proposal (COM(2000) 716 Final) and was reconfirmed by both the European Parliament and the Council when adopting Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules. (c) FMD is usually a disease with clear clinical symptoms in cattle and pigs but may go unobserved in small ruminants.
The report of the NAO (p. 61) details the steps taken by the United Kingdom authorities in March 2001 to accelerate the diagnosis and to shorten the report-to-killing delays.
As part of contingency planning, these persons have to be trained to recognise the key diseases. 49.
The number of official veterinarians in the United Kingdom was based on the minimum requirements for FMD contingency planning. 51.
Consultation with the various bodies, organisations and other stakeholders involved in the control of a possible disease outbreak is carried out in the preparation of contingency plans and the Commission prepared suitable guidelines well in advance of the outbreak.
While early notification of suspicious cases is essential to control the spread of FMD, the disease does not in each and every case produce clearly detectable clinical symptoms and farmers have different levels of training and skill in detecting them.
Where a person in charge of animals wilfully fails to report suspicious signs of disease, he or she is subject to the punishment provided for in the respective national legislation. 53.
Equally, Article 4 of Directive 85/511/EEC requires the suspect holding to be placed immediately under restrictions and an epidemiological investigation to be started in order to rule out or confirm the presence of the disease and to trace dangerous contacts.
Measures taken in relation to such suspicions must be proportionate.
The Irish authorities suspended imports of susceptible animals and their products on 21 February 2001 and informed the Commission thereof at 15.42.
The Irish authorities also traced all animals introduced from the United Kingdom into Ireland and ordered their killing. 56.
This system was introduced because the keeper of animals was, in the interest of the farming community and the national and Community economy, no longer in a position to apply all available instruments for the protection of the herd, such as prophylactic vaccination.
Article 5(3) of Directive 85/511/EEC allows exemption from the taking of samples from animals in a secondary outbreak which has an epidemiological link to a confirmed outbreak for which such samples had already been taken.
The stamping-out policy applies to all confirmed outbreaks and, in accordance with the contingency plans, to animals suspected of being infected or contaminated (Article 3(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC).
For all market support measures adopted in the pig meat sector since the special report No 1/2000, the Commission has applied the same rate of co-funding (50 %) as for veterinary measures.
The financing decisions also clarified that only the "market" value of the animals was eligible for Community funding.
There were four Commission Regulations governing the United Kingdom, Portugal, France and Ireland on the compensation system laid down under measures for monitoring and eradicating bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE) for animals slaughtered under the selective reform provided for by a Member State eradication plan and approved by the Commission.
Only the market value of the animal immediately prior to slaughtering is eligible for Community funding. 63.
Adequate compensation was defined as the market value of animals immediately before slaughtering; the losses of income mentioned are therefore not eligible for Community funding and any such applications were rejected. 64.
The cattle database established in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 and Article 14 of Directive 64/432/EEC is an important tool for tracing the movement of animals, but is of limited value for valuation purposes.
The Commission granted a temporary exemption from certain rules applicable in normal circumstances, especially with regard to the holding of animals.
It was communicated in June 2001 to the authorities of the Netherlands in response to their question on the eligibility for the premium of animals slaughtered in the course of a FMD epidemic and was confirmed in February 2004 to the Netherlands Minister of Agriculture, specifying that the premium could be granted for animals slaughtered in a slaughterhouse as long as the sum of the premium was neither included in the evaluation of animals for the purposes of veterinary compensation nor paid on that count, in order to prevent double payment.
The information supplied by the Netherlands Agricultural Services show that of 1278 holdings affected, 791 had the animals slaughtered in a slaughterhouse. 74.
Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 is applicable with respect to supporting documents, as is pointed out specifically in each veterinary co-financing decision.
Also, Article 55 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 obliges Member States to lay down rules on sanctions applicable to infringements of feed and food law and other Community provisions relating to the protection of animal health and welfare, and to take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented.
It was not until 27 February 2003 that the United Kingdom was able to present a provisional request for reimbursement of operational costs in addition to indemnification. 80.
However, when it was not possible to obtain an adequate guarantee as to the number of animals for which indemnification had actually been paid, DG SANCO applied a flat-rate financial adjustment in order to cover the financial risk incurred by the Commission. 83.
These EUR 400 million represent around 86 % of the total finally paid out. 85.
In the past, there was a discrepancy between the rates applied by DG SANCO and DG AGRI in the pig sector.
Since the swine fever epidemic in 1997, the rates have been harmonised and set at a co-funding rate of 50 %. 86.
Since its first report in 1999 on "Income Insurance in European Agriculture", the Commission has conducted a follow-up study on "Financing risk for livestock epidemics" that includes an analysis of current practices in Member States and outlines possible solutions for the future.
In 2001 the Commission was acting on the basis of Decision 90/424/EEC.
In particular it provides for compensation for animals slaughtered or killed for disease control purposes.
It is in the economic interest of the farmer to notify possible disease as early as possible because any animals that die before notification are not eligible for compensation.
However, a detailed inventory of the animals of susceptible species was required in Articles 4 and 5 of Directive 85/511/EEC and is required in Article 4(3)(a) of Directive 2003/85/EC. 93.
However, conservative estimates only of the costs for the vaccines in case of pan-vaccination of the livestock population registered in the EU in 2001 amount to EUR 150 to 250 million per year.
These estimates do not take account of possible restrictions on exports from Member States, the increase in imports of animal products from countries vaccinating, the disruption of the single market if some Member States would not agree to prophylactic vaccination and the costs of the number of outbreaks still occurring despite vaccination.
The economic impact analysis carried out before submitting the proposal for a new Directive estimated Commission expenditure for maintaining the disease free status and preparing for an emergency at about EUR 4 million per year.
The control measures under Directive 2003/85/EC allow the Member States to use all available and proportionate measures to eradicate the disease as quickly as possible.
It is worth comparing the report of the Scientific Committee of 1999 on emergency vaccination with the current OIE recommendation to acknowledge its pioneering character. 95.
The Commission explained its activities in relation to a critical review of the provisions currently contained in Decision 90/424/EEC in its reply to point 86.
However, the Commission cannot prioritise one suggested solution before all aspects of any possible new system for the compensation of livestock farmers have been considered, including, for example, the implications for competition. 100.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 101.
The Commission, with its critical analysis of mission findings and its determination to constantly improve both legislation and its implementation, considers that even more surveillance and supervision on its part could not have limited the impact of the 2001 outbreak.
The 2001 FMD epidemic had a significant impact on animal husbandry in the whole of the EC in spite of taking all possible measures to continue trade in safe products, for example certain meat and milk products and a whole range of animal by-products, with the affected Member States and commencing for the United Kingdom, but similarly for the Netherlands, a carefully operated phasing-out of the restrictions in October 2001, for example fresh pig meat from the East Anglia pig areas followed gradually by other products as a consequence of the progress made in the completion of the post-outbreak surveillance.
The other three Member States affected by FMD also regained their free status within three months of the last outbreak or the slaughter of the last vaccinated animals respectively.
The EU as a whole was therefore not blocked for all products for a period of 12 months. 103.
Council Decision 90/424/EEC clearly relates the compensation for farmers to the animals that had been killed for disease control purposes.
This requirement encourages farmers to report the disease as early as possible for financial reasons.
The results of these checks were that applications for almost EUR 583 million, or 55 % of the total, were rejected without prompting any dispute with the Member States.
Moreover, it is stated under point 70 that any accumulation of premiums and indemnifications should be prohibited explicitly.
Moreover, on the strength of the experience gained in the classical swine fever epidemic in the Netherlands in 1997 (and, a posteriori, the positive judgment delivered by the Court of Justice at the end of 2003 in the case between the Commission and the Netherlands authorities on the financial corrections made to the request for reimbursement) and its desire to protect Community financial interests, the Commission deliberately laid down more stringent criteria for eligibility of expenditure in the financing decisions applicable to FMD.
The United Kingdom had therefore some initial problems to provide all the information to recipient Member States for the exports of sheep before that date in relation to holdings of origin that were subsequently, given an incubation period of about a fortnight, identified as outbreaks.
By adopting Decision 2001/190/EC on 8 March 2001, the Commission approved the measures already taken by the Member States, including the pre-emptive killing of all sheep imported from the United Kingdom between 1 and 21 February 2001.
On 21 February 2001 the second outbreak was confirmed on the farm next to the abattoir and on 22 February another outbreak, both related to the movement of animals from the slaughterhouse to the farm and subsequent contacts.
All these outbreaks have per se no epidemiological importance with regard to the 2001 FMD epidemic, as they were marginal and dead-end events. [1] Following the outbreaks of FMD in Italy and Greece, to which the Court refers below, the Commission together with the Member States analysed in the Standing Veterinary Committee the epidemiological situation and the effects of the control measures applied; based on the output of working groups involving all Member States, a report was prepared in 1998 outlining the principles of a future FMD control policy.
The Scientific Committee also prepared a report on emergency vaccination in 1999.
More recently, and in the light of the 2001 outbreak, the Community strategy defined in 1990 was unanimously reconfirmed by the International Conference in December 2001, by the Resolution of the EP in December 2002, in the Commission proposal for a new Directive submitted to the Council in December 2002, and finally by the Council adopting Directive 2003/85/EC following an opinion of the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee, and the Committee of the Regions.
