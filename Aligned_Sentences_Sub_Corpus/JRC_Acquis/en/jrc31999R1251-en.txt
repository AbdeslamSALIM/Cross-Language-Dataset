CHAPTER I Article 2 1.
The area payment shall be granted for the area which is down to arable crops or subject to set-aside in accordance with Article 6 and which does not exceed a regional base area.
This is established as the average number of hectares within a region down to arable crops or, where appropriate, fallow in conformity with a publicly funded scheme during 1989, 1990 and 1991.
A region in this sense shall be understood to mean a Member State or a region within the Member State, at the option of the Member State concerned. 3.
If the base area for arable crops or grass silage is not reached in a given marketing year, the balance of hectares shall be allocated for the same marketing year to the corresponding base area. 6.
Where there is an overshoot of a national base area, the Member State concerned may, in accordance with objective criteria, concentrate the measure applicable under paragraph 4 totally or partially on the sub-base areas for which the overshoot has been noted.
Member States which have decided to apply the possibilities provided for in this paragraph, shall notify producers and the Commission by 15 September of their choices and the detailed rules for their application.
In such cases and if the Member States chooses to establish a base area for %quot%arable crops other than maize%quot%: - if the base area for %quot%maize%quot% is not reached in a given marketing year, the balance of hectares shall be allocated for the same marketing year to the corresponding base areas for other crops, - if the base area for %quot%arable crops other than maize%quot% is not reached in a given marketing year, the balance of hectares shall be allocated for the same marketing year to the base area for %quot%maize%quot% concerned.
The irrigated base area shall be equal to the average area irrigated from 1989 to 1991 with a view to harvesting arable crops including the increases made pursuant to Article 3(1), fourth subparagraph, last sentence of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92.
However, the irrigated base area in Portugal shall be progressively increased by up to 60000 ha, for those areas where it has been established that investment in irrigation began after 1 August 1992.
If the irrigated base area is not reached in a given marketing year, the balance of hectares shall be allocated for the same marketing year to the corresponding non-irrigated base area. 4.
However, this obligation may be fulfilled in the case of: - Portuguese cereals by providing data having been supplied pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3653/90 of 11 December 1990 introducing transitional measures governing the common organisation of the market in cereals and rice in Portugal(9), - the five new German Länder by providing the average crop yield applicable in the other German Länder, - Italy and Spain by fixing the reference yield at 3,9 tonnes/hectare and 2,9 tonnes/hectare respectively.
If it emerges from this information that, in a Member State, the average yield resulting from the regionalisation plan applied in 1993 or, in the case of Austria, Finland and Sweden, the average yield resulting from the plan applied in 1995 or, in the case of Italy and Spain the yield as fixed in Article 3(5) is exceeded, all payments to be made in that Member State for the following marketing year shall be reduced in proportion to the overrun which has been recorded.
The basic amount shall be fixed as follows: for protein crops: - EUR 72,50/t from the 2000/2001 marketing year onwards; for cereals, grass silage and set-aside: - EUR 58,67/t for the 2000/2001 marketing year, - EUR 63,00/t from the 2001/2002 marketing year onwards; for linseed: - EUR 88,26/t for the 2000/2001 marketing year, - EUR 75,63/t for the 2001/2002 marketing year, - EUR 63,00/t from the 2002/2003 marketing year onwards; for oilseeds: - EUR 63,00/t from the 2002/2003 marketing year onwards.
The amount of EUR 63/t may be increased from the 2002/2003 marketing year onwards in the light of a final reduction in the intervention price for cereals provided for in Article 3(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92.
This increase in area payments will bear the same proportion to the intervention price reduction as that applicable in 2000/2001 and 2001/2002. 4.
Article 5 A supplement to the area payment of EUR 344,50 per hectare shall be paid for the area down to durum wheat in the traditional production zones listed in Annex II, subject to the limits fixed in Annex III.
The basic rate of compulsory set-aside is fixed at 10 % from the 2000/2001 marketing year up to the 2006/2007 marketing year. 2.
Member States shall be authorised to pay national aid up to 50 % of the costs associated with establishing multiannual crops intended for bio-mass production on set-aside land. 4.
In the case of Portugal, payment shall take account of the aid granted under Regulation (EEC) No 3653/90. 5.
Member States shall allow farmers to set-aside up to at least 10 % of the area down to arable crops and for which a payment application is made, and left in set-aside pursuant to this Regulation.
Producers who make a payment application for an area no bigger than the area which would be needed to produce 92 tonnes of cereals, on the basis of the yields determined for their region, are not bound by the set-aside obligation.
Paragraphs 5 and 6 shall apply to these producers. 8.
Payments shall be made between 16 November and 31 January following the harvest.
In order to qualify for the area payment, a producer shall by 31 May at the latest preceding the relevant harvest have sown the seed and by 15 May at the latest have lodged an application. 3.
CHAPTER II Article 10 1.
The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92, establish the size and distribution of the appropriate reductions to be applied and shall, in particular, ensure that the weighted average reduction for the Community as a whole is equal to the percentage by which the MGA has been exceeded. 4.
The threshold percentage provided for in paragraph 3 should be 0 %. 5.
Article 12 Should specific measures be necessary to facilitate the transition from the system in force to that established by this Regulation, such measures shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92.
Article 13 The measures defined in this Regulation shall be deemed to be intervention intended to stabilise agricultural markets within the meaning of Article 1(2)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999.
Article 14 Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 and Regulation (EEC) No 1872/94 are hereby repealed.
This Regulation shall apply from the 2000/2001 marketing year onwards. 3.
