By letter registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 10 February 2006, the United Kingdom requested authorisation to introduce a measure derogating from Article 21(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC.
In accordance with Article 27(2) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Commission informed the other Member States on 18 July 2006 of the request made by the United Kingdom.
It exploits an opportunity provided by the transitional VAT regime, under which supplies made by a supplier in one Member State to a customer in another are free of VAT in the State of dispatch.
Conclusion The request from the UK attempts to use Article 27 for the purpose of making a fundamental change to the VAT system in the sense of a generalised reverse charge, even if limited to a certain range of goods.
At the same time it must be recognized that other Member States experience similar fraud patterns (involving the same categories or other types of goods) and that they may seek similar derogations from Article 21 of the Sixth Directive.
Article 4 This Decision shall expire on 31 December 2009.
Article 5 This Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
