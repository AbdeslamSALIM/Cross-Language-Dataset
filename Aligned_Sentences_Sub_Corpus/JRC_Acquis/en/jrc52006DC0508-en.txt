THE POLICY CONTEXT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS The Cardiff European Council (June 1998) endorsed the principle that the environmental dimension should be integrated in all Community policies.
The Helsinki European Council (December 1999) adopted the strategy for integrating the environmental dimension into the CAP.
The first Communication “Indicators for the Integration of Environmental Concerns into the Common Agricultural Policy”[2] identified a set of 35 agri-environmental indicators and presented an analytical framework for their development.
The IRENA operation The purpose of the IRENA operation was to develop and compile, for the EU-15, the set of 35 agri-environmental indicators identified in the Commission Communications COM(2000) 20 and COM(2001) 144, at the appropriate geographical levels and, as far as possible, on the basis of existing data sources.
Annex 1 of the Commission staff working document provides the list of the 42 indicators and sub-indicators concerned, and describes their definitions, data sources, geographical reporting level, and the time series used.
Certain agri-environmental indicators are currently being considered for inclusion in the Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework for the rural development programmes for the period 2007–2013.
With a view to covering the different levels of monitoring environmental integration, and based on the work carried out until now, the Commission proposes: to maintain a core set of 28 indicators, which includes 26 IRENA indicators and two new indicators covering new agri-environmental issues (see table annexed). | - 6.2.
This is a long-term project that requires the support and the full participation and commitment of the Member States, in particular as regards the collection and delivery of the necessary data. | - ANNEX Proposal for a consolidated agri-environmental indicator set DPSIR | No | Indicator | Level of development | Main limitations/improvement needed1 (X) | Market signals and attitudes | 4 | Area under organic farming | A | [1] COM(2001) 264, “A Sustainable Europe for a Better World: A European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development”.
