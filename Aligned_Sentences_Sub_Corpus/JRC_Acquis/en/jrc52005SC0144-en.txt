Recommendation for a Council opinion in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated stability programme of France, 2004-2008 /* SEC/2005/0144 final */ Brussels, 2.2.2005 SEC(2005) 144 final Recommendation for a COUNCIL OPINION in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated stability programme of France, 2004-2008 (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Council Regulation (EC) No. 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies[1] stipulates that participating Member States, that is, those which have adopted the single currency, had to submit stability programmes to the Council and the Commission by 1 March 1999.
In view of a government deficit exceeding 3% of GDP in 2002, the Council decided that France was in excessive deficit on 3 June 2003 and recommended that the excessive deficit be corrected by 2004 at the latest.
In its Communication to the Council on “the situation of Germany and France in relation to their obligation under the excessive deficit procedure following the judgement of the Court of Justice” adopted on 14 December 2004[2], the Commission concluded that 2005 should be considered the relevant deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit.
The first stability programme of France, covering the period 1999-2002, was submitted on 18 January 1999 and assessed by the Council on 15 March 1999.
Updates have been presented every subsequent year, the most recent one having been submitted on 7 December 2004.
This evaluation is as follows: - The 2004 update of the stability programme of France was submitted to the Commission on 7 December 2004.
For the years 2004-2006, the projections of the Commission services are slightly less favourable than those of the programme, with real GDP growth being projected at 2.4% in 2004 and 2.2% in 2005 and 2006.
Overall, while somewhat on the high side, the macroeconomic projections of the programme can be considered plausible. - The programme is aimed at reducing the general government deficit to below 3% of GDP in 2005 and at ensuring its continuous decline in the following years.
The deficit reduction in 2005, from 3.6% of GDP in 2004 to 2.9% of GDP, would be achieved notably by a one-off revenue item amounting to 0.4% of GDP[5].
In the subsequent years, the deficit is projected to decline by 0.6-0.7 percentage point of GDP per year to 0.9% of GDP in 2008.
The primary balance would improve from a deficit of 0.7% of GDP in 2004 to a surplus of 2.2% of GDP in 2008.
In particular, the reduction of the deficit projected for 2006 seems out of reach under current policies.
The programme foresees a decline in the deficit from 2.9% of GDP in 2005 to 2.2% of GDP in 2006, though tax cuts worth 0.2% of GDP have already been announced and one-off revenues will vanish.
This means that, under current growth assumptions, measures leading to a deficit reduction by about one percentage point of GDP in 2006 would have to be taken in order to achieve the target set in the programme.
The structural reforms implemented in 2003 and 2004, notably the pension and health reforms, constitute clear steps in the right direction but appear insufficient to secure the foreseen deceleration of expenditure.
It is also insufficient to ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact’s medium-term objective of a budgetary position of close to balance is achieved within the programme period. - After increasing by 8 percentage points between 2001 and 2004 to 64.8% of GDP, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain above 60% of GDP throughout the period covered by the programme (62% in 2008).
A gradual reduction would start only in 2006, triggered by nominal GDP growth and the shift to primary surpluses.
Notably, the programme presents in detail the reform of the health insurance system implemented in summer 2004, which aims to bring the health insurance system to budgetary balance in 2007 (from a deficit of 0.8% of GDP in 2004), while preserving the quality of the health service.
However, the reduction of the cyclically-adjusted deficit in 2004 will be significantly lower than recommended and France did not take measures in order to accelerate the reduction in the cyclically-adjusted deficit when growth conditions improved.
The macro-economic scenario underlying the programme envisages real GDP growth at 2.5% from 2004 to 2008, a rate marginally above potential.
On 3 June 2003, the Council decided that an excessive deficit existed in France and recommended that this be corrected by 2004 at the latest.
In its Communication to the Council on “the situation of Germany and France in relation to their obligation under the excessive deficit procedure following the judgement of the Court of Justice” adopted on 14 December 2004[7], the Commission concluded that 2005 should be considered the relevant deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit since the Council conclusions of November 2003 had produced legal effects until annulled by the Court.
According to Commission calculations based on the projections of the programme and the commonly agreed methodology, the cyclically-adjusted balance would also improve by about 0.6-0.7 percentage point per year from 2005, and would reach -0.7% of GDP in 2008.
The programme projects the debt ratio to decline from 2006 onwards and to reach 62% of GDP in 2008.
The economic policies as reflected in the 2004 update are partly consistent with the recommendations in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, specifically those with budgetary implications.
However, the reduction of the cyclically-adjusted deficit in 2004 will be significantly lower than recommended, and, moreover, France did not take measures in order to accelerate the reduction in the cyclically-adjusted deficit when growth conditions became favourable.
