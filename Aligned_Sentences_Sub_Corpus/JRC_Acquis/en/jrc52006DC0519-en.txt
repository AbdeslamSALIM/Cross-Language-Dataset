They follow international developments in these areas, in particular in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Codex Alimentairius, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC).
European law provides for the Commission to organise training courses for the staff of the competent authorities in the Member States in charge of verifying compliance with EU food and feed law, animal health and animal welfare requirements, and with plant health requirements.
The involvement of participants from third countries will lead to a better understanding of EU food standards and import procedures thus lowering the hurdle for third countries, and in particular developing countries, to place goods on the EU market.
At international level, Community legislation referred to above allows compliance with the international obligations laid down in international agreements such as those developed by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Codex Alimentairius, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC).
Along with the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules[1], the verification of compliance with these requirements is also based on Community law.
In the above context, control staff of the competent authorities and/or control bodies in the Member States and in third countries will need training on and regular updating of their knowledge of Community rules with regard to food law, feed law, animal health, animal welfare and plant health requirements, and on the techniques to verify compliance therewith.
Participation of third countries in Community training programmes will play an important role in promoting Community standards at international level, thus enhancing international trade of safe food, and providing EU businesses with easier access to safe goods from third countries.
Apart from a better competitive position and easier access to the EU market, it may possibly contribute to a better food security and food safety for the consumers in these countries. 3.4.
Impact on public authorities Although much of the responsibility for information and training of staff performing official controls rests with the national competent authorities (Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004), the development of a Community training strategy aims to achieve more uniformity of control procedures, control methods and control results.
The implementation of a Community training strategy should constitute an effective instrument to optimise resources and determine scale economies to the advantage of both Community and national public authorities. 3.5.
Training on the basis of Council Decision 90/424/EEC The exchange of staff members of the controlling authorities in the Member States is a training method that has been applied in the past on the basis of Article 19 of Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field[4].
In general, the response from participants was very positive and demonstrates that there is an important need to have training in place. 6.3.
The legal background Article 51 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 allows the Commission to organise training courses for the staff of the competent authorities of Member States and for participants from third countries.
Volume of Community training The training activities that are organised in 2006 concern nearly 1 500 participants.
Additionally, Community training should address control staff working on a daily basis with several aspects of Community law, in accordance with a selection to be made by the Member States, and participants from third countries.
The management of Community training Whatever training system is chosen, there must be co ntinuous management allowing to lay down priorities and identify training projects, establish a training programme (annual or multi-annual), verify the quality of training , verify the quality of the training material, and to establish procedures necessary for the fluent functioning of a training system.
The option of choice should be determined by taking into account different parameters, and in particular: ( EU training should be complementary : training organised at Community level should not compete with training organised by the Member States, but should be complementary to it by adding a European dimension to training. ( Priority based : in view of the wide scope to be covered by training, it is necessary to set clear priorities.
They could become a reference centre for assisting with training activities in the other Member States in first instance by “training the trainers”, but also by organising regular training sessions for staff of the controlling authorities in the Member States and from third countries.
The experience that has been build over a number of years may be lost at the end of a contract. 8.2.
One of these is a cost-benefit analysis to be carried out taking into account the factors referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003.
A regulatory agency A European training body assuming all or part of the tasks related to the organisation and delivery of training could also be seen as an organisation independent from the Commission, working in accordance with its founding Regulation to be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament, in the form of a regulatory agency.
Representatives from developing countries were also invited to the other courses. [1] OJ L 165, 30.4.2004 (see corrigenda in OJ L 191, 28.5.2004, p. 1).
