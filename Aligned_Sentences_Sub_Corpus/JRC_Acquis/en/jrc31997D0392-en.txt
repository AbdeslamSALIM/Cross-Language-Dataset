MS1, RF1), pursuant to Council Directive 90/220/EEC (Text with EEA relevance) COMMISSION DECISION of 6 June 1997 concerning the placing on the market of genetically modified swede-rape (Brassica napus L.
C/F/95/05/01/A): seeds of hybrid swede-rape (Brassica napus L.
oleifera Metzg.) derived from crosses using: (a) the progeny of the male sterile swede-rape line MS1 (B91-4) cultivar Drakkar containing the barnase gene from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens coding for ribonuclease, the bar gene from Streptomyces hygroscopicus coding for phosphinothricin acetyl transferase, the neo gene from Escherichia coli coding for neomycin phosphotransferase II, the promoter PSsuAra from Arabidopsis thaliana, the promoter PNos from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the promoter PTA29 from Nicotiana tabacum; and (b) the progeny of the fertility restoration swede-rape line RF1 (B93-101) cultivar Drakkar containing the barstard gene from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens coding for ribonuclease inhibitor, the bar gene from Streptomyces hygroscopicus coding for phosphinothricin acetyl transferase, the neo gene from Escherichia coli coding for neomycin phosphotransferase II, the promoter PSsuAra from Arabidopsis thaliana, the promoter PNos from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the promoter PTA29 from Nicotiana tabacum. 2.
