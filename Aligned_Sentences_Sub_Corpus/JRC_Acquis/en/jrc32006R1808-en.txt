The validity of Regulation (EC) No 1615/2000 has been extended until 31 December 2006. (4) By letter dated 17 July 2006 Nepal submitted a request for prolongation of the derogation in accordance with Article 76 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. (5) When the validity of Regulation (EC) No 1615/2000 was extended until 31 December 2006, it was expected that new, simpler and more development-friendly GSP rules of origin would be in force before expiry of the derogation.
However the new GSP rules of origin are not expected to be adopted before 31 December 2006. (6) Application of the GSP rules of origin currently in force would have an adverse effect on investment, and employment in Nepal as well as on ability of existing industry in Nepal to continue its exports to the Community. (7) The prolongation period should take account of the time necessary to adopt and implement new GSP rules of origin.
In addition, the interests of traders concluding contracts both in Nepal and in the Community, as well as the stability of Nepalese industry, require that the derogation should be prolonged for a period sufficient to permit the continuation or conclusion of longer term contracts. (8) The derogation should therefore be prolonged until 31 December 2008.
It shall apply from 1 January 2007.
