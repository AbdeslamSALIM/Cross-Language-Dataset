Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on The mobility of persons in the enlarged Europe and its impact on means of transport Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on "The mobility of persons in the enlarged Europe and its impact on means of transport" (2006/C 28/09) On 10 February 2005, the European Economic and Social Committee, acting under Rule 29(2) of its Rules of Procedure, decided to draw up an opinion on: The mobility of persons in the enlarged Europe and its impact on means of transport.
plenary session, held on 26 and 27 October 2005 (meeting of 26 October), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 74 votes, with four abstentions. 1.
The difficulties encountered all over Europe in developing appropriate and consistent services in urban transport (safety, comfort, respect for the environment, pollution, quality and continuity of service â€¦) makes it necessary to pool expertise in order to draw out the greatest possible benefit for users; - 100 to 250 km: more frequent use is made of day returns, including for cross-border travel, e.g.
The often quoted figure of 100 million Chinese being able to travel outside their country as tourists by 2020 seems unrealistic today.
However, this represents only 8 % of the Chinese population.
This is smaller than the percentage of Japanese tourists who travel abroad each year (around 12 million people).
Failure to provide Chinese and Indian visitors with the mobility they expect when the time comes will mean that they will travel instead to countries which are in a position to welcome them. 2.3.4 The Committee noted with interest the document published by the Commission in September 2004 and entitled: European energy and transport: Scenario on key drivers.
The data covers 30 countries (the 25 Member States, to which the Commission has added Romania, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Norway and Turkey).
Generally speaking, passenger transport in these countries will grow over a forty-year period. (Gpkm = Giga-passenger per kilometre) - 4,196 Gpkm in 1990 to 5021 in 2000 (+20 % in 10 years); - 5,817 Gpkm in 2010 (+16 % in 10 years); - 6,700 Gpkm in 2020 (+15 % in 10 years); - 7,540 Gpkm in 2030 (only 12,5 % in 10 years). 2.3.6 The Committee notes that, interestingly, the predictions for the coming decades foresee lower growth than for the 1990/2000 period.
This would seem to indicate that the mobility of persons is no longer a measure of economic vitality. 2.3.7 The indication is that passenger transport in private cars will increase by 45 % in the 2000/2030 period, but rail transport by only 30 %.
Meanwhile, air transport will increase 300 % over the same period.
