For the Commission Margot Wallström Member of the Commission (1) OJ L 237, 21.9.2000, p. 1. (2) OJ L 57, 5.3.1999, p. 21. (3) OJ L 31, 28.11.2001, p. 29.
The functional unit, to which inputs and outputs should be related, is 1 kg of textile product at normal conditions (65 % RH ± 2 % and 20 °C ± 2 °C; these norm conditions are specified in ISO 139 Textiles - standard atmospheres for conditioning and testing).
The criteria set in this section for a given fibre-type need not be met if that fibre contributes to less than 5 % of the total weight of the textile fibres in the product.
This requirement does not apply where more than 50 % of the cotton content is organically grown cotton or transitional cotton, that is to say certified by an independent organisation to have been produced in conformity with the production and inspection requirements laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 of 24 June 1991 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs(1).
This requirement does not apply if documentary evidence can be presented that establishes the identity of the farmers producing at least 75 % of the cotton used in the final product, together with a declaration from these farmers that the substances listed above have not been applied to the fields or cotton plants producing the cotton in question, or to the cotton itself.
Where 100 % of the cotton is organic, that is to say certified by an independent organisation to have been produced in conformity with the production and inspection requirements laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 the applicant may place the mention %quot%organic cotton%quot% next to the eco-label.
For scouring effluent treated on site and discharged to surface waters, the COD discharged to surface waters shall not exceed 5 g/kg greasy wool.
Polyester (a) The amount of antimony in the polyester fibres shall not exceed 260 ppm.
In the following cases, the level shall be less than 100 mg Cl/kg: - linen and other bast fibres, - cotton, which has a degree of polymerisation below 1800, and which is intended for white end products.
Impurities in dyes The levels of ionic impurities in the dyes used shall not exceed the following: Ag 100 ppm; As 50 ppm; Ba 100 ppm; Cd 20 ppm; Co 500 ppm; Cr 100 ppm; Cu 250 ppm; Fe 2500 ppm; Hg 4 ppm; Mn 1000 ppm; Ni 200 ppm; Pb 100 ppm; Se 20 ppm; Sb 50 ppm; Sn 250 ppm; Zn 1500 ppm.
If metal complex dyes based on copper, chromium or nickel are used: (a) In case of cellulose dyeing, where metal complex dyes are part of the dye recipe, less than 20 % of each of those metal complex dyes applied (input to the process) shall be discharged to waste water treatment (whether on-site or off-site).
Should this declaration be subject to verification the following test method and threshold shall be used: German method B-82.02 or French method XP G 08-014, 30 ppm threshold. (Note: false positives may be possible with respect to the presence of 4-aminoazobenzene, and confirmation is therefore recommended). 22.
Potentially sensitising dyes The following dyes shall only be used if the fastness to perspiration (acid and alkaline) of the dyed fibres, yarn or fabric is at least 4: %gt%TABLE%gt% Assessment and verification: The applicant shall either provide a declaration of non-use of these dyes or a test report using the following test method for colour fastness: ISO 105-E04 (acid and alkaline, comparison with multi-fibre fabric). 24.
Dimensional changes during washing and drying Information on dimensional changes (%) shall be stated both on the care label and on the packaging and/or other product information if the dimensional changes exceed: - 2 % (warp and weft) for curtains and for furniture fabric that is washable and removable, - 6 % (warp and weft) for other woven products, - 8 % (length and width) for other knitted products, - 8 % (length and width) for terry towelling.
Colour fastness to washing The colour fastness to washing shall be at least level 3 to 4 for colour change and at least level 3 to 4 for staining.
A level of 3 is nevertheless allowed when fabrics are both dark coloured (standard depth %amp%gt; 1/1) and made of regenerated wool or more than 20 % silk.
A level of 2 is nevertheless allowed for indigo dyed denim.
Colour fastness to dry rubbing The colour fastness to dry rubbing shall be at least level 4.
Colour fastness to light For fabrics intended for furniture, curtains or drapes, the colour fastness to light shall be at least level 5.
A level of 4 is nevertheless allowed when fabrics intended for furniture, curtains or drapes are both light coloured (standard depth %amp%lt; 1/12) and made of more than 20 % wool or other keratin fibres, or more than 20 % silk, or more than 20 % linen or other bast fibres.
Information appearing on the eco-label Box 2 of the eco-label shall contain the following text: - reduced water pollution - hazardous substances restricted - whole production chain covered Assessment and verification: The applicant shall provide a sample of the product packaging showing the label, together with a declaration of compliance with this criterion.
