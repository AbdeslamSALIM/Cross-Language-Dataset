The driver of a heavy goods vehicle registered after 1 October 1990 shall also carry, and produce upon request, a standard COP document, modelled on Annex B, as evidence of the Nox emissions of that vehicle.
Until 31 December 1996, on a vehicle's entry into Austrian territory a duly-completed form bearing the requisite number of ecopoints shall be handed to the supervisory authorities, who will hand back a copy with the proof of payment.
For Austrian-registered heavy goods vehicles leaving Italy, a duly-completed copy of the form referred to in Article 1 (1), bearing the requisite number of ecopoints for Italy, shall replace the authorization provided for. 2.
Conitnuous transit journeys through Austria using the following rail terminals shall be deemed as bilateral journeys: Fuernitz/Villach Sued, Sillian, Innsbruck/Hall, Brennersee, Graz.
They may be used between 1 January of the year for which they are valid and 31 January of the following year.
Infringements of Protocol No 9 or of this Regulation by a driver of a heavy goods vehicle or an undertaking shall be prosecuted in accordance with the national legislation in force.
In the case of repeated infringements, Article 8 (3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 881/92 (3) shall apply. 2.
The Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States shall, each within the limits of their jurisdiction, provide each other with administrative assistance in investigating and prosecuting infringements of Protocol No 9 or this Regulation, notably in ensuring that the documents specified in Article 1 are correctly used and handled. 3.
Distribution of ecopoints Article 6 1.
A number of ecopoints equal to 96,66 % of the total available shall be distributed between the Member States according to the distribution scale shown in Annex D. 2.
Each year the competent authorities of the Member States shall return to the Commission, by 15 October at the latest, any ecopoints which, on the basis of available data and the estimates for traffic for the final months of the year, are likely not be used before the end of the year.
The ecopoints which are not distributed among Member States, in accordance with Article 6, as well as those which have been returned to the Commission, in accordance with Article 7, shall constitute a Community reserve. 2.
The ecopoints of the Community reserve are to be allocated by the Commission to the Member States, according to the procedure set out in Article 16 of Protocol No 9, at least one month before the end of the year, taking into account the manner in which each Member State managed the ecopoints allocated to it and the objective needs of the hauliers of each Member State, which may, in particular, be determined using the following criteria: - the special position of Greece and Italy as detailed in Annex E, - a disadvantageous starting position, - problems with the technical upgrading of the vehicle fleet concerning NOx emissions, - geographical circumstances, - unforeseen occurrences.
Adaptation of ecopoint figures Article 9 Annex 4 of Protocol No 9 to the Act of Accession of Norway, Austria, Finland and Sweden shall be adapted as follows: %quot%%quot% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%1995%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%71,7 %%gt% ID=%quot%3%quot%%gt%16 889 810%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%1996%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%65,0 %%gt% ID=%quot%3%quot%%gt%15 311 543%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%1997%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%59,1 %%gt% ID=%quot%3%quot%%gt%13 921 726%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%1998%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%54,8 %%gt% ID=%quot%3%quot%%gt%12 908 809%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%1999%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%51,9 %%gt% ID=%quot%3%quot%%gt%12 225 678%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%2000%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%49,8 %%gt% ID=%quot%3%quot%%gt%11 730 998%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%2001%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%48,5 %%gt% ID=%quot%3%quot%%gt%11 424 767%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%2002%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%44,8 %%gt% ID=%quot%3%quot%%gt%10 533 187%quot%%gt% ID=%quot%1%quot%%gt%2003%gt% ID=%quot%2%quot%%gt%40,0 %%gt% ID=%quot%3%quot%%gt%9 422 488%quot%%gt% IV.
Technical questions concerning the ecopoint system Article 10 By way of clarification from Article 11 (2) (b) and Annex 5 (1) of Protocol No 9, in the case of vehicles registered before 1 October 1990 which have had a change of engine since this date, the COP value of the new engine shall apply.
Article 11 Where a traction unit registered in a Member State other than Austria is replaced by an Austrian-registered traction unit during a transit journey across Austria to Italy, a permit for bilateral traffic between Austria and Italy shall, until 31 December 1996, be required in addition to the proof of payment for the journey by the first traction unit.
Article 12 A transit journey shall be exempt from paying ecopoints if the following three conditions are met: (i) the sole purpose of the journey is to deliver a brand-new vehicle, or vehicle combination, from the manufacturers to a destination in another State; (ii) no goods are transported on the journey; (iii) the vehicle or vehicle combination has appropriate international registration papers and export licence plates.
Article 13 A transit journey shall be exempt from paying ecopoints if it is the empty leg of a journey exempt from ecopoints as listed in Annex C and the vehicle carries suitable documentation to demonstrate this.
This Article shall apply to the transit traffic of heavy goods vehicles with a maximum authorized weight of over 3,5 tonnes registered in Austria across German territory either via Bad Reichenhall ('Kleines Deutsches Eck') or via the Inntal-motorway A8/A93 between the crossings Bad Reichenhall/Autobahn and Kiefersfelden ('Grosses Deutsches Eck'). 2.
On the 'Kleines Deutsches Eck', Germany may limit the number of single journeys of Austrian heavy goods vehicles to 4 700 per week until 30 June 1995 and to 2 350 single journeys per week until 31 December 1996. 3.
On the 'Grosses Deutsches Eck', Germany may, until 31 December 1996, limit the number of single journeys of transiting Austrian vehicles, other than those made on the basis of bilateral traffic authorizations or journeys on own account, to 2 350 per week.
As from 1 January 1997 the non-discriminatory treatment of Austrian hauliers shall be ensured. 4.
On the 'Kleines Deutsches Eck' the Commission shall, before 1 October 1996 and after consultation, notably with Austria and Germany, review the necessity and efficiency of this regime with a view to establishing a non-discriminatory system based on environmental criteria and electronic controls to be applied as from 1 January 1997 to heavy goods vehicles as defined in Article 1 (d) of Protocol No 9 to the Act of Accession for Austria and which shall not exceed the restrictions applying to the transit of heavy goods vehicles across Austrian territory.
Final provisions Article 15 This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 1995, subject to the entry into force of the Act of Accession of Norway, Austria, Finland and Sweden.
