Case T-72/06: Action brought on 23 February 2006 — Groupe Gascogne v Commission Action brought on 23 February 2006 — Groupe Gascogne v Commission Parties Applicant: Groupe Gascogne (Saint-Paul-lès-Dax, France) (represented by: C.
Lazarus, lawyer) Defendant: Commission of the European Communities Form of order sought The applicant claims that the Court should: - primarily, set aside Articles 1(k), 2(i) and 4(12) of the decision in so far as they are addressed to Groupe Gascogne and imposed a fine on it, and amend Article 2(i) of the decision in so far as it imposes on Sachsa, contrary to Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17/62 and Article 23(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, a fine in excess of 10 % of its turnover; - in the alternative, set aside Article 2(i) of the decision; - in the further alternative, amend Article 2(i) of the decision and reduce the amount of the fine imposed jointly and severally on Sachsa and Groupe Gascogne; - order the Commission to pay all of the costs of the proceedings.
By its second plea, put forward by way of alternative submission, the applicant submits that the Commission erred in law by misconstruing the notion of 'undertaking' within the meaning of Article 81 EC and, as a result, imposing on it a fine calculated on the basis of the consolidated turnover of Groupe Gascogne, whereas, according to the applicant, it ought to have based itself on the aggregate corporate turnover of Groupe Gascogne and Sachsa, having failed to set out reasons as to why the other subsidiaries of Groupe Gascogne ought to be included within %quot%the undertaking%quot% liable in respect of the practices of Sachsa adjudged anti-competitive in the contested decision.
