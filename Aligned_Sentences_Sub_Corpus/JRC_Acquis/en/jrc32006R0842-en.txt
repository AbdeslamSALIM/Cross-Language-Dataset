Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases (Text with EEA relevance) Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular, Article 175(1) thereof and Article 95 thereof in relation to Articles 7, 8 and 9 of this Regulation, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2], in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 14 March 2006, Whereas: (1) The Sixth Community Environment Action Programme [3] identifies climate change as a priority for action.
The legal base should therefore be Article 175(1) of the Treaty. (7) Nevertheless, it is appropriate to take measures at Community level on the basis of Article 95 of the Treaty to harmonise requirements on the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases and the marketing and labelling of products and equipment containing fluorinated greenhouse gases.
Those penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. (15) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. (16) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the containment and reporting of certain fluorinated greenhouse gases and the control of use and placing on the market of products and equipment containing certain fluorinated greenhouse gases, in order to protect the environment and to preserve the internal market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore by reason of the scale and effects of this Regulation be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
This Regulation addresses the containment, use, recovery and destruction of the fluorinated greenhouse gases listed in Annex I; the labelling and disposal of products and equipment containing those gases; the reporting of information on those gases; the control of uses referred to in Article 8 and the placing on the market prohibitions of the products and equipment referred to in Article 9 and Annex II; and the training and certification of personnel and companies involved in activities provided for by this Regulation.
Article 3 Containment 1.
They shall also maintain records of other relevant information including the identification of the company or technician who performed the servicing or maintenance, as well as the dates and results of the checks carried out under paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 and relevant information specifically identifying the separate stationary equipment of applications referred to in paragraph 2(b) and (c).
By 4 July 2007, the Commission shall establish, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), the standard leakage checking requirements for each of the applications referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.
Article 4 Recovery 1.
Recovery, for the purpose of recycling, reclamation or destruction of the fluorinated greenhouse gases, pursuant to paragraphs 1 to 3, shall take place before the final disposal of that equipment and, when appropriate, during its servicing and maintenance.
Article 5 Training and certification 1.
By 4 July 2007, on the basis of information received from Member States and in consultation with the relevant sectors, minimum requirements and the conditions for mutual recognition shall be established in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2) in respect of training programmes and certification for both the companies and the relevant personnel involved in installation, maintenance or servicing of the equipment and systems covered by Article 3(1) as well as for the personnel involved in the activities provided for in Articles 3 and 4. 2.
By 4 July 2007 the Commission shall determine, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), the format of the notification referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article.
Article 6 Reporting 1.
By 4 July 2007, the Commission shall determine, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), the format of the reports referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. 3.
Article 7 Labelling 1.
Paragraph 1 shall apply to the following types of products and equipment: (a) refrigeration products and equipment which contain perfluorocarbons or preparations containing perfluorocarbons; (b) refrigeration and air conditioning products and equipment (other than those contained in motor vehicles), heat pumps, fire protection systems and fire extinguishers, if the respective type of product or equipment contains hydrofluorocarbons or preparations containing hydrofluorocarbons; (c) switchgear which contains sulphur hexafluoride or preparations containing sulphur hexafluoride; and (d) all fluorinated greenhouse gas containers. 3.
The use of sulphur hexafluoride or preparations thereof for the filling of vehicle tyres shall be prohibited from 4 July 2007.
Article 9 Placing on the market 1.
The placing on the market of products and equipment containing, or whose functioning relies upon, fluorinated greenhouse gases, as listed in Annex II shall be prohibited as specified in that Annex. 2.
The Commission shall provide to the Committee referred to in Article 12(1) relevant information on such measures.
Article 10 Review 1.
It shall, if appropriate, accompany this report with legislative proposals by 31 December 2008, with a view to applying the provisions of Article 3 to air-conditioning systems, other than those fitted to motor vehicles referred to in Directive 70/156/EEC, and refrigeration systems contained in modes of transport. 2.
Article 12 Committee 1.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee instituted by Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000. 2.
Article 13 Penalties 1.
Article 14 Without prejudice to Article 9(3), Member States may maintain or introduce more stringent protective measures in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 95 of the Treaty, in relation to Articles 7, 8 and 9 of this Regulation, or Article 176 of the Treaty in relation to other Articles of this Regulation.
Article 15 Entry into force This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply with effect from 4 July 2007, with the exception of Article 9 and Annex II, which shall apply from 4 July 2006.
