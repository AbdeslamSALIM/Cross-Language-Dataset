By letter registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 16 March 2005, Latvia has requested authorisation to extend the application of a derogation measure on timber transactions previously granted for a limited period by the Act of Accession.
This provision, derogating from Article 21 of Directive 77/388/EEC, stipulates that in the case of transactions in relation to timber, the recipient of goods or services is, under certain circumstances, the person liable to account for the VAT.
Impact will in any case be limited because of the narrow scope of the derogation. | LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | 305 | Summary of the proposed action Authorisation for Latvia to extend the application of a measure derogating from Article 21 of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC as regards the use of a reverse charge mechanism for timber transactions. | 310 | Legal basis Article 27(1) of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment. | 329 | Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Community.
