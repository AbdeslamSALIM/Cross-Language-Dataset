The Commission received an application for an accelerated review by South Asian Petrochem Limited, a new exporting producer in India.
The Commission initiated on 12 January 2005 this accelerated review with a view to determine if and to what extent the imports of PET produced and exported to the Community by South Asian Petrochem Limited should be subject to the countervailing duty currently in force.
Consequently, it is proposed to amend Council Regulation (EC) 2603/2000 imposing a countervailing duty on imports of PET originating, inter alia, in India by including the specific duty rate established for South Asian Petrochem Limited and by accepting the undertaking offered.
PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 2603/2000[3], imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate (‘PET’) with a coefficient of viscosity of 78 ml/g or higher, according to DIN (‘Deutsche Industrienorm’) 53728, normally declared within CN code 3907 60 20 and originating, inter alia, in India (‘the product concerned’).
The measures took the form of a specific duty ranging between EUR 0 and 41,3 per tonne for co-operating individual Indian exporters, with a specific duty of EUR 41,3 per tonne for all other Indian exporters.
CURRENT PROCEDURE 1.
Furthermore, it asserted that it had not exported the product concerned during the original investigation period (1 October 1998 to 30 September 1999), but had exported the product concerned to the Community subsequently. 2.
Initiation of an accelerated review (3) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the applicant and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the basic Regulation.
Product concerned (4) The product covered by this review is the same product as the one under consideration in Council Regulation (EC) No 2603/2000 (see recital (1) above). 4.
Investigation period (5) The investigation of subsidisation covered the period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2004 (‘the review investigation period’). 5.
Subsidisation (12) On the basis of the information contained in the applicant’s reply to the Commission’s questionnaire and further collected in the course of the investigation, the following schemes were investigated: - Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme; - Export Credit Scheme; - Export Oriented Unit Scheme/Special Economic Zones Scheme; - Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme; - Income Tax Exemption Scheme; - West Bengal Incentives Scheme. 2.1 Schemes originally investigated and used by the company 2.1.1 Export Oriented Unit Scheme (‘EOUS’)/ Special Economic Zones Scheme (‘SEZS’) (a) Legal basis (13) These schemes are based on the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act 1992 (No 22 of 1992) which entered into force on 7 August 1992 (‘Foreign Trade Act’).
By the means of ‘CENVAT’-credit only an added value bears a definitive duty for the company, not the input materials. (30) Thus, only the exemption from basic customs duty, special additional customs duty, the sales tax reimbursement and the duty drawback on furnace oil constitute subsidies within the meaning of Article 2 of the basic Regulation.
The export objective of an EOU as set out in paragraph 6.1 of the FTP is a conditio sine qua non to obtain the incentives. (31) Furthermore, these subsidies cannot be considered as permissible duty drawback systems or substitution drawback systems within the meaning of Article 2(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation.
In conformity with the same provision and standard EC practice, a period of 12 months was chosen as review investigation period and findings are based on this period of time.
Schemes originally investigated but not used by the company 2.2.1 Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme (‘DEPBS’) (51) The applicant had not availed itself of benefits under the DEPBS. 2.2.2 Export Promotion Capital Goods scheme (‘EPCGS’) (52) It was established that the applicant had not imported capital goods under the EPCGS and, therefore, had not availed itself of the EPCGS. 2.2.3 Income Tax Exemption Scheme (53) It was established that the applicant did not, in the absence of taxable profits, receive the benefit of an income tax exemption under Section 10B of the Income Tax Act 1961 during the review investigation period. 2.3.
The ECS subsidy rate so established is 0,4%. 2.3.2 West Bengal Incentive Scheme (‘WBIS’) (62) The detailed description of the WBIS is set out in Government of West Bengal (‘GOWB’) Commerce %amp% Industries Department notification No 588-CI/H of 22 June 1999 (‘WBIS 1999’) which was last replaced by notification No 134-CI/O/Incentive/17/03/I of 24 March 2004 (‘WBIS 2004’).
Total amount of countervailable subsidies (63) Taking account of the definitive findings relating to the schemes as set out above, the rate of countervailable subsidies for the applicant is as follows: ECS | EOUS | Total | South Asian Petrochem Limited | 0,4% | 13,5% | 13,9% | E.
