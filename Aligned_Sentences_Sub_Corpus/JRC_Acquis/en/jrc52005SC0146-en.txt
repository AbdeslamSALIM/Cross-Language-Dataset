Recommendation for a Council opinion in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated convergence programme of Slovakia, 2004-2007 /* SEC/2005/0146 final */ Brussels, 2.2.2005 SEC(2005) 146 final Recommendation for a COUNCIL OPINION in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated convergence programme of Slovakia, 2004-2007 (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies[1] stipulates that non-participating Member States, that is, those which have not adopted the single currency, have to submit convergence programmes to the Council and the Commission.
In accordance with Article 9 of this Regulation, the Council has to examine each convergence programme based on assessments prepared by the Commission and the Committee set up by Article 114 of the Treaty (the Economic and Financial Committee).
In view of a general government deficit of 3.6% of GDP recorded in 2003, the Council decided that Slovakia was in excessive deficit on 5 July 2004 and recommended that the excessive deficit be corrected by 2007 at the latest, in line with the May 2004 convergence programme.
The first convergence programme of Slovakia, covering the period 2004-2007, was submitted on 14 May 2004 and assessed by the Council on 5 July 2004.
Slovakia submitted an update of its convergence programme on 30 November 2004.
This evaluation warrants the following assessment: - Slovakia submitted its update of the convergence programme on 30 November 2004.
Unemployment is predicted to fall only gradually from around 18½% in 2004 (in labour force survey terms) to 16½% in 2007.
The update anticipates the current account balance to become positive in 2007 (after a temporary deterioration to a deficit of almost 3% of GDP in 2005).
The spread towards the euro area of long-term interest rates has been hovering at or below 100 basis points.
Altogether, the koruna has gained almost 6% in 2004. - The update aims at reducing the deficit to the 3% of GDP reference value in 2007, in line with the Council recommendation under Article 104 (7).
Even net of the impact resulting from the introduction of a funded pension pillar at the beginning of 2005 (estimated at 0.4% of GDP in 2005 and some 1% of GDP in 2006 and 2007), most of the deficit reduction takes place in the last two years.
Compared to the May 2004 programme, in which the adjustment was expenditure-based, the update plans a correction of the deficit through expenditure retrenchment and revenue increases.
And finally, the parliamentary elections scheduled in 2006 lead to uncertainties, in particular on the extent to which further expenditure retrenchments will be implemented in 2007.
In particular, Slovakia is on track to correct its excessive deficit by the deadline set by the Council. - In view of the above assessment and in light of the recommendations made by the Council under Article 104(7), it would be appropriate for Slovakia to (i) seize every opportunity for an accelerated deficit reduction, including through the use of better-than-expected revenues and of savings on the expenditure side, in particular in 2005; (ii) make the medium-term expenditure ceilings more binding; (iii) be vigilant that second-round effects from the high inflation in 2004 do not affect the inflation convergence path envisaged in the programme.
The programme’s projections for inflation appear on the low side and are only plausible if second-round effects from the high headline inflation in 2004 are strictly contained.
The programme update aims at reducing the deficit to the 3% of GDP reference value in 2007, in line with the Council recommendation under Article 104 (7).
Compared to the May 2004 programme, when the adjustment was expenditure-based, the update plans a correction of the deficit through expenditure retrenchment and revenue increases.
And finally, the parliamentary elections scheduled in 2006 lead to uncertainties, in particular on the extent to which further expenditure retrenchments will be implemented in 2007.
In particular, Slovakia is on track to correct its excessive deficit by the deadline set by the Council. * * * In view of the above assessment and in light of the recommendations made by the Council under Article 104(7), the Council is of the opinion that Slovakia should: (i) seize every opportunity for an accelerated deficit reduction, including through the use of better-than-expected revenues and of savings on the expenditure side, in particular in 2005. (ii) make the medium-term expenditure ceilings more binding. (iii) be vigilant that second-round effects from the high inflation in 2004 do not affect the inflation convergence path envisaged in the programme.

While not hampering the assessment, there remain (relatively small) differences with the Statistical Office as regards the consolidated expenditure- and revenue-to-GDP ratios for 2003 and, furthermore, concerning the classification of components of general government consumption; notably social transfers in kind are not provided as separate category.
The other optional data missing are the nominal effective exchange rates for the years 2006 and 2007.
