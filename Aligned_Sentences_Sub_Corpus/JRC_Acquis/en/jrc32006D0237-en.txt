The Netherlands invoked Article 86(2) of the Treaty and asked the Commission to decide that the measure does not constitute state aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty since it represents appropriate compensation for the obligation to provide a service of general economic interest (%quot%SGEI%quot%) within the meaning of Article 86(2) of the Treaty.
The Netherlands submitted that information by letters of 24 March 2003 (registered as received on 28 March 2003 under No A/32279) and 19 June 2003 (registered as received on 25 June under No A/34394).
Representatives of the Netherlands and of the Commission met on 21 May 2003.
Two competitors submitted a joint complaint on the aid by letter of 2 May 2003 (registered as received on 5 May under No A/33155).
By letter of 20 May 2003 (registered as received the same day under No A/33548), they informed the Commission that a subsidiary of one of them supported the complaint as well. (3) By decision C(2003)1763 of 24 June 2003, the Commission initiated the Article 88(2) procedure in respect of the notified measure.
The Commission received comments from four interested parties (registered under Nos A/36309, A/36463, A/36645, A/36679, A/36870, A/37077, A/37480 and A/37569), including from the two competitors that had submitted the complaint in May, also on behalf of another company belonging to the group to which one of the two original competitors belongs (hereinafter these four entities together are referred to as %quot%the two joint competitors%quot%).
The Commission forwarded these comments to the Netherlands by letters of 1 October 2003 (D/56129), 29 October 2003 (D/56898), 7 November 2003 (D/57120) and 12 November 2003 (D/57185).
These letters also contained some further questions from the Commission. (4) By letter of 13 August 2003 (registered as received on 14 August 2003 under No A/35706), the two joint competitors informed the Commission that part of the aid had been paid to AVR Nuts and they asked the Commission to take an injunction decision to suspend further payments and a decision ordering the Netherlands to provisionally recover the aid pursuant to Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty [3].
As requested by the Commission on 20 August 2003 (D/55321), the Netherlands confirmed by letter of 25 September 2003 (registered as received on 30 September under No A/36690) that, as regards 2002 and the first quarter of 2003, the notified aid had been paid to AVR Nuts.
By letter of 20 October 2003 (D/56735), the Commission informed the two joint competitors that it did not intend to take the decisions requested.
The two joint competitors restated their request by letters of 14 November 2003 (registered as received on 17 November under No A/37909) and of 1 December 2003 (registered as received on 2 December under No A/38325).
On 16 July this decision was sent to the Netherlands, which asked for an extension of the deadline for comments and for a meeting to be convened to discuss the ongoing developments (letter of 30 July 2003, registered as received on 4 August under A/35996).
Another meeting between representatives of the Commission and of the two joint competitors took place on 26 August 2004.
The Netherlands commented on the Commission’s decision by letter of 10 September 2004 (registered as received on 17 September under No A/36999).
By letter of 30 September 2004 (D/56902), the Commission requested further information which the Netherlands provided by letter of 22 October 2004 (registered as received on 27 October under No A/38271).
In that letter, the Netherlands confirmed that further aid had been paid to the recipient for the remainder of 2003, the first three quarters of 2004 and the closure of one of the installations. (7) The decision to extend the procedure was published in the Official Journal of 9 October 2004 [4].
The Commission received comments from the two joint competitors (letters of 16 and 19 November 2004, registered under Nos A/38860 and A/38978).
It forwarded these comments to the Netherlands by letter of 22 November 2004 (D/58307).
Following these letters, yet another meeting between representatives of the Commission and of the two joint competitors took place on 26 May.
The C2 depot is used for the appropriate disposal of hazardous waste that cannot be incinerated (%quot%C2 waste%quot%).
This has become a wider phenomenon affecting, for example, the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium. 2.2 Recipient (14) The C2 depot and the various RDFs were originally set up by AVR Chemie C.V. (%quot%AVR Chemie%quot%), which is owned 30 % by the State and 70 % by Holding AVR Bedrijven N.V. (%quot%AVR-Holding%quot% or %quot%AVR%quot% in short).
It is currently 100 %-owned by Rotterdam municipality, which has though recently announced its intention to sell its shares in AVR.
As from the mid-1990s, AVR Chemie incurred losses (€10,9 million in 2000 and €7,2 million in 2001).
The theoretically available capacity is 80-85 % of the permitted capacity.
AVR treated 84880 tonnes of hazardous waste (both RDF and other) in 2001, 81274 tonnes in 2002 and 78297 tonnes in 2003.
The actual volume of RDF waste treated in the RDFs is estimated at 19000 tonnes for 2002 and 23000 tonnes for 2003.
Certain types of RDF waste can also be disposed of in municipal waste incinerators, which operate at a lower temperature. (16) AVR Nuts is obliged to keep separate accounts in accordance with Commission Directive 80/723/EEC of 25 June 1980 on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings [11]. 2.3 The aid 2.3.1 The operating deficits (17) The aid and the activities for which it is granted are defined in a concession decision by the Minister for Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM) dated 3 July 2002 and in a concession agreement between the Netherlands, AVR Holding, AVR Nuts, AVR IW and a number of other subsidiaries signed on 10 July 2002.
It was to run from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006. (18) The aid amounts to 100 % of the predetermined operating deficit, which is calculated on the basis of a methodology laid down by an independent accountant.
In the event of a predetermined operating surplus, 70 % of it would be used to pay back the aid granted previously.
Table 1 Predetermined and actual acquisition costs | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | Predetermined additional costs | 514000 | 532000 | 550000 | Predetermined start-up costs - international acquisition | 400000 | 400000 | – | Total predetermined costs | 914000 | 932000 | 550000 | Actual costs | 875000 | 900000 | 930000 | (21) At the outset, the deficit was expected to increase to €3,8 million in 2006, but market and operating conditions proved to be much more difficult than anticipated, with little hope for improvement.
The predetermined deficits for 2004 and thereafter were expected to be much higher than foreseen and, indeed, the predetermined deficit for 2004 amounted to €8,898 million [12].
The calculation took account of the decision to close the RDFs. 2.3.2 Compensation for closure costs (22) In view of the mounting operating deficits, the Netherlands, as already indicated in points 5 and 7, reconsidered its policy.
At the end of 2003, it was decided to close one of the two RDFs with effect from 1 July 2004.
This amount concerns various investments which were written off to the extent of 50 % if they concerned both RDFs or to the extent of 100 % if they were made specifically for the RDF that was being closed down.
This amount includes the other 50 % of the remaining book value of the above investments carried out with the approval of the State and 100 % of the remaining book value of the investments carried out with the approval of the State but concerning only the second RDF.
The Netherlands explained that, if the remaining RDF had continued operating until the end of 2006, the sum of the estimated operating deficits for 2005 and 2006 and the compensation for the costs of closure at the end of 2006 would have amounted to €31 million.
Table 2 Overview of compensation paid to AVR Predetermined budget deficit 2002 | 1500000 | Predetermined budget deficit 2003 | 2800000 | Predetermined budget deficit 2004 | 8898000 | Compensation for remaining book value first RDF | 8670108 | Compensation for remaining book value second RDF | 11151000 | Compensation for additional closure costs –additional operating costs 2004 | 1750000 | –recurrent fixed costs 2005-06 | 5843000 | –additional redundancy costs | 7868000 | –other | 1238000 | | 16699000 | Total aid | 49718108 | (27) The Netherlands acknowledged that aid totalling €19543608 had been paid to AVR.
The compensation for the closure of the second RDF has been paid into a blocked account. 2.3.3 The guarantee for removal and follow-up costs (28) The concession agreement also contains a guarantee by the State that, if AVR Chemie is wound up, the State will pay a maximum of 30 % of the removal and follow-up costs of dismantling and decontaminating the installations.
The Dutch authorities have control over the level of the fees as the predetermined budget deficit requires their approval beforehand and the fees are, of course, a crucial element in the calculation. (30) Gate fees for high-calorific hazardous waste used as fuel are much lower than those for RDF waste.
These %quot%staggered rebates%quot% are fixed in advance and apply when RDF waste is offered together with at least 75 % of the same volume of high-calorific waste. (32) All fees are fixed in advance for the entire concession period [13] and apply equally to AVR’s competitors and AVR IW.
As from the start of the concession agreement, the fees for C2 and RDF waste were publicly available to any supplier.
This interested party maintained too that the measure would distort competition on the international market for %quot%turnkey clean-up%quot% operations of PCBs, pesticides and other hazardous organic waste. (42) The third interested party, Edelchemie, was concerned about the domestic market.
Edelchemie's comments concern AVR Nuts, AVR Chemie and its predecessors as from 1963, providing details on Dutch hazardous waste policy over the years. (43) Lastly, the three joint competitors drew attention to the domestic market for RDF waste.
At the meeting on 26 May 2005, a representative stated literally that %quot%The right decision [in 2002] had been to close down one RDF%quot%.
The profits would be booked with AVR IW, the losses with AVR Nuts.
It also has been explicitly stated that the fees charged to other AVR companies for treating other waste should be the same as those charged to third parties [16].
The average fee for all waste flows from other countries would be somewhat higher than the average fee charged domestically.
Edelchemie (62) The Netherlands noted that Edelchemie was working primarily in the field of photographic hazardous waste, which, for reasons of efficiency, cannot be dealt with by AVR.
Any aid granted previously would fall outside the ten-year limit laid down in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 and, as the installations are written off over ten years, calculation of AVR’s expected operating deficits would not be affected in any event.
The compensation granted to AVR IW for the costs of acquiring high-calorific hazardous waste was explained by the need to have sufficient quantities of such waste available as fuel.
It was higher than in previous years despite the closure of one RDF since the market conditions had worsened and, in particular, the fees received for high-calorific hazardous waste had decreased. (68) The payment for dismantling and follow-up in the event of the liquidation of AVR Chemie will have to be discussed between the State and AVR as the State owns 30 % of AVR Chemie.
The same applies to any payment by the State of the removal and follow-up costs, for which the State has given a guarantee of up to 30 %. (71) The measures must be regarded as affecting trade between Member States.
This is reflected in the aid measures, in particular the deficit for 2004 and the compensation for closure.
Under the circumstances, the measures must be regarded as conferring a selective advantage on AVR Nuts and not simply as providing compensation that other companies in a similar situation could have received under similar conditions if they had been entrusted with the performance of this service obligation. (74) A selective benefit flows not only from the operating deficits and the compensation for the costs of closure, but also from the state guarantee for 30 % of the removal and follow-up costs incurred.
This, however, is not incompatible with the public interest as regards the actual quantities of RDF and C2 waste disposed of.
The interested parties may have been right in maintaining that all hazardous waste produced in the Netherlands during that period could have been disposed of or recovered within the country or abroad even without AVR’s RDFs.
Absence of overcompensation (90) Overcompensation must be avoided for all aid elements in the system.
Variable costs, direct fixed costs and costs charged by other AVR companies are estimated on the basis of detailed breakdowns.
The predetermined budget deficit in 2004 is based entirely on the same methodology and the increase in the predetermined deficit, despite the closure of one of the RDFs, is fully explained by the various cost elements of this methodology (see the figures in Annex I).
Given the high losses in excess of the predetermined deficits for 2002 and 2003, it need not surprise anyone that the predetermined deficit for 2004 was higher.
The closure of the first RDF, moreover, may have reduced the variable costs, but its impact on fixed costs, which account for a significant part of total costs, has been limited.
It would have increased significantly the predetermined losses over that period and hence the level of aid.
Consequently, for this element too, the Commission requests the Netherlands to verify the actual costs and to adjust the aid level if necessary. (94) The Commission can also accept that compensation is granted for additional costs resulting from the earlier-than-expected closure of the RDFs.
The information provided by the Netherlands on these additional costs is relatively detailed.
Consequently, for this element as well, the Commission requests the Netherlands to verify the actual costs and to adjust the aid level if necessary. (95) Lastly, the Commission can accept that aid is granted through application of the guarantee covering 30 % of the costs of removal and decontamination.
The actual costs, however, are not yet known, so the Commission will require appropriate ex post control. (96) To sum up, the Commission finds no overcompensation for the operating deficits for 2002 and 2003 but can allow the remaining aid elements only on condition that the Netherlands ensures that there is no overcompensation ex post over the entire period, taking into account excess losses and profits for all the years covered by the concession agreement.
The following aspects of the measure are considered to be proportionate as well. (99) Gate-fee system based on staggered rebates: Since the aim of this system is to maintain sufficient capacity for the proper disposal of RDF waste, the natural consequence is to aim for maximum capacity utilisation in order to minimise costs.
As shown by the Netherlands, all suppliers could have applied for a refund, either directly or when supplying via intermediaries.
The same applies to the guarantee by the State to cover a maximum of 30 % of the costs of removal and decontamination in the event of the installations being liquidated.
Given its 30 % share in AVR Chemie, it is acceptable that the State should assume responsibility for its part, leaving the remainder for the other shareholder, AVR Holding. (101) Maintaining two RDFs at the outset: The Commission examined whether the Netherlands should have granted aid for maintaining only one RDF.
First, part of the expected supply of RDF waste to AVR Nuts may have been the consequence of the restrictive application of the definition of %quot%waste for recovery%quot% by the Netherlands up to the beginning of 2003.
Third, the estimate would not take into account the possibility for AVR to treat part of the waste in its grate incinerators for municipal waste [21].
Furthermore, had the Dutch authorities in 2002 based the estimated flow of RDF waste on the assumption that the definition of %quot%waste for recovery%quot% would have been correctly applied, the estimate might have been lower, but it seems unlikely that, on the basis of the information available at the time, such an estimate would have been so low that they could have confidently decided that only one RDF would suffice.
The interested parties have failed to demonstrate that the Dutch authorities should have taken into account back in 2002 sufficient alternative domestic capacity for treating all types of RDF waste produced in the Netherlands and delivered for disposal. (104) The decision to keep in operation two RDFs instead of one increased the level of aid, in particular because of the investments which appeared to be necessary and in respect of which compensation had subsequently to be paid because of the closure.
Moreover, as the aid was determined on the basis of a predetermined budget, the Commission expects AVR to have opted for efficient solutions, and not to have rerouted waste if this would have led to underutilisation of the installations and hence higher actual losses.
As indicated in point 99, the system of non-discriminatory staggered rebates can be accepted for this reason.
As regards high-calorific hazardous waste, had there been persistent shortages, the solution could have consisted in lowering the gate fees in a non-discriminatory fashion.
As regards RDF waste, the compensation for acquisition costs must be considered as disproportionate too.
It confers on AVR IW a discriminatory advantage for a specific activity that is in direct competition with other waste management companies.
The compatibility of this part of the measure with Article 87(2) and (3) is assessed in Section 6.3 below. 6.3 Assessment on the basis of Article 87 of the compensation for acquisition costs (109) The Commission has examined whether the exemptions in Article 87(2) and (3) of the Treaty apply to the compensation for acquisition costs granted to AVR IW.
The exemptions in Article 87(2) could serve as a basis for considering aid to be compatible with the common market.
The Netherlands has not attempted to justify the aid on any of these grounds. (111) As regards the first part of the exemption in Article 87(3)(c), namely aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities, the Commission notes that the aid does not involve research and development, investment by small and medium-sized enterprises or the rescue or restructuring of AVR IW.
An interim report on this verification must be submitted to the Commission by the spring of 2006 and the final report by the spring of 2007.
This aid may not be paid out before the Commission has approved it pursuant to Article 4 or 7 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999. (115) However, the compensation of €2396000 granted to AVR IW for the costs of acquiring waste cannot be found compatible since it cannot be regarded as proportionate compensation for the SGEI.
It calls on the Netherlands to submit within two months of the notification of the decision all documents showing that recovery proceedings have been initiated against AVR IW (such as recovery orders), HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 The compensation for operating deficits, the compensation for the costs of closing down the rotating drum furnaces and the state guarantee covering 30 % of the costs of removal and decontamination, which follow from the concession agreement between the Netherlands and AVR Nuts and which have been partially implemented by the Netherlands, constitute state aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty.
Article 2 Subject to the conditions set out in Article 3 of this decision, the state aid referred to in Article 1, with the exception of the aid referred to in Article 4 and granted to AVR IW, is compatible with the common market as it compensates the recipient for the costs of a service of general economic interest within the meaning of Article 86(2) of the Treaty.
The Netherlands shall submit a report on the application of the measures in 2004 and annual reports on the implementation of the guarantee for the costs of removal and decontamination and on the application of the measures for the C2 depot for the remaining duration.
It shall submit an interim report on the verification of the compensation for closure costs by the spring of 2006 and a final report by the spring of 2007.
Article 4 The aid for AVR IW consisting in the compensation for acquisition costs amounting to €2396000 is incompatible with the common market.
Article 6 1 The Netherlands shall inform the Commission, within two months of notification of this decision, of the measures already taken and planned to recover the aid referred to in Article 4.
It shall provide this information using the questionnaire attached in Annex III to this decision. 2.
Article 7 This decision is addressed to Kingdom of the Netherlands.

hazardous waste with a calorific value of less than 11,5 MJ/kg (≤1 % chlorine) or 15 MJ/kg (%gt%1 % chlorine), packaged hazardous waste, specific hospital waste and waste containing PCBs. [7] OJ L 30, 6.2.1993, p. 1; as subsequently amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2557/2001 (OJ L 349, 31.12.2001, p. 1). [8] See, in particular, Case C-203/96 Chemische Afvalstoffen Dusseldorp B.V.
A similar provision allows downward adjustment of the aid in the event of a significantly smaller loss than that determined in advance. [21] The three joint competitors pointed out in particular that Figure 3.2 on theoretical and actual availability and the supply of hazardous waste in the study %quot%Toekomst verbranden specifiek gevaarlijk afval%quot% (annexed to their comments and also to the letter from the Netherlands) suggests an unduly high estimate for the supply of RDF waste because it would not take into account the possibility for AVR to treat part of the waste in its grate incinerators for municipal waste.
The methodology is based on a detailed assessment of the budgets for 2002 and subsequently makes extrapolations for 2003, taking into account all known factors that can be expected to affect the actual outcome for 2003.
The 2002 budget is based on estimated revenues, historical ratios for variable costs and estimates for other costs.
