Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the statistical classification of economic activities NACE Rev. 2 and amending Council Regulation (EEC) N%deg% 3037/90 and certain EC Regulations on specific statistical domains /* COM/2006/0039 final - COD 2006/0011 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 06.02.2006 COM(2006) 39 final 2006/0011 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing the statistical classification of economic activities NACE Rev. 2 and amending Council Regulation (EEC) N° 3037/90 and certain EC Regulations on specific statistical domains (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The statistical classification of economic activities known as NACE Rev. 1 was established in 1990 for the harmonisation of economic statistics.
The revised version is motivated by the important changes in the economy since 1990 and a major revision of international classifications of activities: as a result, the proposed NACE Rev. 2 is more relevant with respect to the economic reality and more comparable with other international classifications. | 130 | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal Council Regulation (EEC) N° 3037/90 on the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community: it established NACE Rev. 1. | 141 | Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. | CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | Consultation of interested parties | 211 | Consultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents Several consultations have been organised since 2002, including with National Statistical Institutes, as well as European business and trade associations, asking for proposals and modifications of NACE Rev. 1. | 212 | Summary of responses and how they have been taken into account All proposals (more than 2000) have been considered and analysed by groups of technical experts. | Collection and use of expertise | 229 | There was no need for external expertise. | 230 | Impact assessment The first option was to revise NACE according to principles of relevance with economic reality, comparability with other international classifications, and continuity with the previous classification.
This would have prevented comparability of statistics with other economies and would have resulted in statistical information that was not adequate to the current needs. | LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | 305 | Summary of the proposed action Establishment of a revised classification of economic activities and provisions for its implementation in current statistical surveys. | 310 | Legal basis Article 285(1) of the EC Treaty. | 329 | Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Community.
The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. | Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons. | 331 | The proposed Regulation includes a provision which allows Member States to establish a national statistical classification consistent with NACE, allowing them to meet the specific needs of their national economy. | 332 | The present proposal represents a balance between the level of detail requested by the main users and the workload in the statistical institutes. | Choice of instruments | 341 | Proposed instruments: Regulation. | 342 | Other means would not be adequate for the following reason.
