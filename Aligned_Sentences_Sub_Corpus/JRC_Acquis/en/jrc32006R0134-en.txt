Commission Regulation (EC) No%nbsp%134/2006 of 26 January 2006 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of lever arch mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China Commission Regulation (EC) No 134/2006 of 26 January 2006 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of lever arch mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Communities [1], (the basic Regulation) and in particular Article 7 thereof, After consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: A.
Initiation (1) On 28 April 2005, pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation, the Commission announced by a notice (notice of initiation) published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2], the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding with regard to imports into the Community of lever arch mechanisms originating in the People’s Republic of China ("PRC"). (2) The proceeding was initiated following a complaint lodged on 11 March 2005 by three Community producers, namely Interkov spol s.r.o, MI.ME.CA s.r.l.
and Niko — Metallurgical company, d.d.
Zelezniki (the complainant) representing a major proportion, in this case more than 50 %, of the total Community production of lever arch mechanisms.
However, they withdrew their cooperation before the verification of the MET claim forms was carried out. (9) In light of the need to establish a normal value for exporting producers in the PRC to which MET might not be granted, a verification to establish normal value on the basis of data from an analogue country took place at the premises of the following companies: Producer in Iran: - Metalise Co. 3.
The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the period from 1 January 2001 to the end of the investigation period (period considered). 4.
Market economy treatment (MET) (17) Pursuant to Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation, in anti-dumping investigations concerning imports originating in the PRC, normal value shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 6 of the said Article for those producers which were found to meet the criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation.
Individual treatment (IT) (26) Further to Article 2(7)(a), of the basic Regulation a country-wide duty, if any, is established for countries falling under Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, except in those cases where companies are able to demonstrate, in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation, that their export prices and quantities as well as the conditions and terms of the sales are freely determined, that exchange rates are carried out at market rates, and that any State interference is not such as to permit circumvention of measures if exporters are given different rates of duty. (27) The exporting producer to which MET could not be granted also claimed IT in the event it was not granted MET.
The investigation showed that the company met all the requirements for IT as set forth in Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. (29) It was therefore concluded that IT should be granted to the following two exporting producers in the PRC: - Dongguan Nanzha Leco Stationery, - Wah Hing Stationery Manufactory Limited. 3.
The main arguments against India as an analogue country were that: - there are only few Indian producers and there is no competition on the domestic Indian market, - India only produces for its domestic market and not for export, - the production in India is with different specifications and the production process is therefore also different, - the Indian volume of production is minor compared to the Chinese production, - the Indian production is not stable with regard to quantity and quality. (34) The interested parties, however, were not able to suggest a more appropriate alternative nor could they provide any details or substantiate their allegation that India was not an appropriate analogue country. (35) The Commission therefore sought cooperation from India but also from all other known potential analogue countries such as: Turkey, South Africa, Iran and Thailand. (36) It emerged however that from among those countries mentioned in the preceding recital, lever arch mechanisms are currently only produced by very few producers in India and Iran.
The normal value was established on the basis of all prices paid or payable on the domestic market of Iran for comparable product types as the transactions by the producer in Iran were found to be made in the ordinary course of trade. (40) As a result, normal value was established as the weighted average domestic sales price to unrelated customers by the cooperating producer in Iran. 4.
Export prices (41) For the export sales to the Community of the exporter granted IT which were made via related companies outside the Community, the export price was established on the basis of resale prices to independent customers in the Community. (42) In all cases where the product concerned was exported to independent customers in the Community, the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, namely on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable. 5.
Dumping margin 6.1.
For the cooperating exporting producer granted IT (45) For the company granted individual treatment, the weighted average normal value for each type exported to the Community established for the analogue country was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type exported to the Community, as provided in Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation. (46) The provisional weighted average dumping margins expressed as a percentage of the cif Community frontier price duty unpaid are: Dongguan Nanzha Leco Stationary 33,4 %. 6.2.
The export price was then compared with the normal value established for the analogue country.
No information found during this exercise showed that the calculations were not fair and reasonable. (49) On this basis, the countrywide level of dumping was provisionally established at 48,1 % of the cif Community frontier price. (50) This margin applies to all the producers to which no IT was granted.
Community production (51) The investigation established that LAM were manufactured by the following producers in the Community during the investigation period: the three complainant Community producers, two other producers who supported the complaint and fully cooperated with the Commission during the investigation and Esselte who was only producing LAM for its own use. (52) Another company was producing and importing lever arch mechanisms exclusively for its own use during the IP.
The company replied to the questionnaire intended for Community producers and provided the data on its own production. (53) One further producer who submitted a letter of support to the complaint was found not to have produced the product concerned during the IP. (54) The complainants alleged that some other companies were producing the product concerned during the IP, however in limited quantities.
Whilst the majority of the EC sales of that producer during the IP were produced in the Community, it emerged that about 25 % of the Community sales volume was purchased from the PRC.
This represented around 39 % of its total production. (56) Although this is a relatively important share of the company’s business it was found that these imports were made as a matter of self-defence against low-priced dumped imports from the PRC.
Importing Chinese LAM has certainly allowed the company to survive until now. (57) It was also found that the core activity of this company is located in the Community and its behaviour is clearly that of a Community producer.
It is therefore considered that the production of that producer should be included in the definition of the Community production. (58) Hence, the volume of Community production for the purpose of Article 4(1) of the basic Regulation has been provisionally calculated by adding the production of the five cooperating Community producers which supported the complaint to the production data available for one additional producer. 2.
These companies therefore constitute the Community industry within the meaning of Articles 4(1) and 5(4) of the basic Regulation. (60) It should be noted that even if the producer which imported Chinese LAM was excluded from Community production and Community industry the remaining producers still constitute a major proportion of the total Community production, as defined in Article 5(4) of the basic Regulation. 3.
Indeed, the CN code for LAM also includes ring binder mechanisms and is expressed only in tonnes, not in units. (62) The following table shows that demand of the product concerned in the Community significantly increased over the period considered: Table 1 (1000 pieces) | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 (IP) | Consumption | 301440 | 301990 | 337300 | 399670 | Index | 100 | 100 | 112 | 132 | (63) The main increase occurred in the period from 2003 up to the end of the IP when consumption increased by 18 % or by more than 62 million units.
The Community industry increased its sales volume by 8 % or by 14 million units.
During the same period, imports from China increased by 29 % or by 48 million units. 4.
Volume, market share and average price of imports concerned (a) Import volume and market share (64) As mentioned in recital 61, the volume of Chinese imports was based on the data contained in the complaint.
However, this data was cross-checked with Eurostat data and compared with the export data verified at the premises of the largest exporter in China representing over 65 % of total Chinese exports which cooperated in the investigation.
Both sources confirmed that the trends in volume were comparable to those contained in the complaint. (65) The evolution of imports from the country concerned, in volume and market share, has been the following: Table 2 Import volumes (1000 pieces) | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | PRC | 135000 | 130000 | 166000 | 214000 | Index | 100 | 96 | 123 | 159 | Market shares of the imports | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | PRC | 44,8 % | 43,1 % | 49,2 % | 53,6 % | Index | 100 | 96 | 110 | 120 | (66) As shown in table 1 above, consumption of lever arch mechanisms in the Community increased by 32 %, or by 98 million units during the period considered.
In the meantime, the imports from the country concerned have risen by around 59 %, namely an increase by 79 million units.
The import price level was so low in 2003, coinciding with a 20 % increase in consumption, that it could be increased by 11 % between 2003 and the IP.
Overall the price decrease of dumped imports was as high as 11 % during the period considered. (68) A comparison of selling prices on the Community market during the IP was made between the prices of the Community industry and those of the Chinese exporting producers.
Economic situation of the Community industry (70) In accordance with Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation, the examination of the impact of the dumped imports on the Community industry included an evaluation of all economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry for the period considered, namely from 2001 to the IP. (71) The Community industry data below represent the aggregated information verified for the five cooperating Community producers. 5.1.
Production, production capacity and capacity utilisation (72) The evolution of production, production capacity and capacity utilisation is the following: Table 4 Indices 2001 = 100 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Production (1000 units) | 225065 | 222036 | 221472 | 219990 | Index production (2001=100) | 100 | 99 | 98 | 98 | Production capacity (units) | 454423 | 439504 | 488387 | 490172 | Index production capacity | 100 | 97 | 107 | 108 | Capacity utilisation % | 50 % | 51 % | 45 % | 45 % | Index capacity utilisation | 100 | 102 | 92 | 91 | (73) Despite the existence of an increased demand the Community industry’s production slightly decreased by 2 % during the period considered.
However, capacity utilisation decreased by 9 %, also because of a slight decrease of production. 5.2.
Table 5 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Stocks (1000 pieces) | 11750 | 8242 | 15201 | 15236 | Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 70 | 129 | 130 | (75) The investigation showed that stocks held by the Community industry was not a relevant indicator for the assessment of the economic situation of the Community industry.
Table 6 Indices 2001 = 100 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Sales volume (1000 pieces) | 166440 | 171990 | 171300 | 185670 | Index | 100 | 103 | 103 | 112 | Market share | 55,1 % | 56,6 % | 50,7 % | 46,4 % | Index | 100 | 103 | 92 | 84 | Average sales prices (EUR/1000 pieces) | 152 | 142 | 137 | 132 | Index | 100 | 93 | 90 | 87 | (77) The investigation revealed that the Community industry could somewhat benefit from the increase of consumption by raising its sales by 12 % during the period considered, or by around 19 million units. (78) Nevertheless, the Community industry’s market share declined from 55,1 % in 2001 to 46,4 % at the end of the IP.
Table 7 Profitability on Community sales (RoT) | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Profitability on EC sales | – 13 % | – 17 % | – 19 % | – 26 % | — trend | | – 4 % | – 6 % | – 13 % | (82) Profitability was negative throughout the period considered.
Employment, productivity and wages Table 9 Indices 2001 = 100 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Number of employees | 792 | 773 | 746 | 713 | Index | 100 | 98 | 94 | 90 | Productivity (1000 units/employee) | 284 | 287 | 297 | 309 | Index | 100 | 101 | 104 | 109 | Wages (average per employee, per annum in euro) | 15619,65 | 15747,02 | 15338,60 | 15545,16 | Index | 100 | 101 | 98 | 100 | (87) The Community industry decreased its number of employees from 2001 to the IP.
Productivity could be improved over the period considered due to an increased level of investment coupled with the decrease in the number of employees. (88) Total wages and related costs paid by the Community industry remained stable during the period considered.
It is recalled that import volumes from the PRC have increased considerably, both in volume terms (+ 79 million units) and market share (+ 8,8 percentage points) during the period considered.
Furthermore, the average unit price of those imports decreased by 11 %, which is reflected in the price undercutting found in the investigation. (92) While the sales volumes of the Community industry increased, that industry did hardly benefit from the significant growth of the Community market (+ 32 % or + 98 million units) during the IP.
Notwithstanding the effort deployed to become more competitive the financial situation of the Community industry significantly worsened during the IP. (93) It has also to be noted that some Community producers stopped production or went out of business in recent years. (94) Bearing in mind all indicators it is concluded that the Community industry suffered material injury during the IP within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic Regulation.
Effect of the imports from the PRC (96) It is recalled that import volumes from the PRC increased by around 43 % as did its market share by 8,8 percentage points during the period considered.
In addition, as explained in recital 67, the import prices from the PRC fell by 11 % and Chinese import prices undercut those of the Community industry by 24 %.
In that period the volume of LAM imported from China increased by 48 million units while significant price undercutting was found to exist.
During the same period the sales volume of the Community industry only increased by 14 million units thus resulting in a loss of market share of 4,3 percentage points in a rapidly increasing market.
Simultaneously, the Community industry had to decrease average sales price by around 4 %.
The dramatic worsening in its financial situation during this period is for instance evidenced by an increase of its losses by 7 percentage points.
It should be noted that the imports from China was already at a high level at the beginning of the period considered and that the community industry was therefore in a vulnerable situation from the beginning of this period. (98) As shown by the increasing market share in Table 2, Chinese exporters practicing dumping became the major players on the Community market supplanting the Community industry during the IP. 3.
Effects of imports from third countries (99) As explained in recital 36, there are not many companies in the world producing and exporting LAM.
The core market of these producers was clearly their domestic market. (100) It is therefore very unlikely that imports originating in other third countries, such as India could have contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry.
The information available is extremely limited so that it is not even possible to make a reliable estimate of this limited quantity, if any, of imports from other third countries. (101) It is therefore considered that the imports of LAM originating in other third countries could not have affected the economic situation of the Community industry. 4.
Effects of Chinese imports made by the Community industry (102) As explained in recital 55, it was found that one of the cooperating producers included in the definition of the Community industry imported the product concerned from the PRC during the period considered.
The vast majority of the EC sales of that producer during the IP were produced in the Community — about 25 % of the sales volume was purchased from the PRC. (103) The investigation showed that the said producer imported LAM from China which were produced by a Chinese exporter with whom he had a commercial agreement.
It was also found that the resale price at which he was selling the imported LAM was comparable to the price he was selling LAM of its own production. (104) On this basis, it is not considered that such imports have contributed to the material injury suffered by the Community industry.
This producer also clearly supports the current proceeding. (105) It is therefore very unlikely that the imports made by the said producer contributed to the injury found. 5.
Exports outside the EU represented between 7,4 % and 16,2 % of total sales of the Community industry during the period considered.
Table 10 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Exports (1000 units) | 32419 | 23114 | 18303 | 14551 | Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 71 | 56 | 45 | (108) Exports of the Community industry decreased by around 18 million units throughout the period considered.
It should be borne in mind that during that period Chinese exports were also gaining market share in other worldwide markets, as evidenced by the analysis of the information gathered for the choice of the analogue country. (109) In addition, the investigation showed that Community industry production was rather stable and only decreased by 2 % during the period considered.
Conclusion on causation (111) It must be underlined that the injury in this case primarily materialised in the form of price depression causing a further increase in losses.
Based on the above analysis of the effects of all known factors on the situation of the Community industry, it is provisionally concluded that there is a clear coincidence in time and thus a causal link between the dumped imports from the PRC and the material injury suffered by the Community industry pursuant to Article 3(6) of the basic Regulation.
COMMUNITY INTEREST 1.1.
General considerations (112) In accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation, it has been examined whether compelling reasons exist that could lead to the conclusion that it would be against the Community interest to impose anti-dumping duties against imports from the country concerned.
Interest of the Community industry (114) It is recalled that the Community industry consisted of five producers employing over 700 people in the production and sale of the product concerned.
It is considered that these suppliers are representative of the steel suppliers industry in this proceeding. (119) It is clear that the supplier industry risks seeing one sales segment disappearing in the short term in case no measures are taken against low-priced dumped imports.
Interest of users and importers (122) Replies from eight users and two importers located in the Community market were received.
The total business of these parties is significant but LAM only represents 10 % of the overall activity. (123) Users and importers generally oppose the imposition of AD measures, as the product concerned represents a high share of the cost of the downstream product, namely around 20 % of total costs of the downstream product.
These users and importers can be considered representative for the industry since they represent more than 50 % of this.
Such cost increase would in particular affect companies which are mainly purchasing low-priced dumped products from China.
Conclusion on Community interest (131) The imposition of measures on imports of LAM originating in the PRC would clearly be in the interests of the Community industry.
PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES 1.
The pre-tax profit margin used for this calculation was 5 % of turnover.
The non-injurious price was obtained by adding the abovementioned profit margin of 5 % to the cost of production. (135) The necessary price increase was then determined on the basis of a comparison of the weighted average import price with the weighted average non-injurious price of the like product sold by the Community industry on the Community market. (136) Any difference resulting from this comparison was then expressed as a percentage of the average import cif value.
Provisional measures (137) In light of the foregoing, it is considered that a provisional anti-dumping duty should be imposed at the level of the dumping margin found, but should not, in accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, be higher than the injury margin calculated above. (138) The individual company anti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation were established on the basis of the findings of the present investigation.
The Commission, if appropriate, will, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, amend the Regulation accordingly by updating the list of companies benefiting from individual duty rates. (140) On the basis of the above, the provisional duty rates are: Dongguan Nanzha Leco Stationery | 33,3 % | All other companies | 48,1 %. | G.
A provisional anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of lever arch mechanisms for archiving sheets and other documents in binders and files and falling within CN code ex83051000, (TARIC code 8305100050) originating in the People’s Republic of China.
The release for free circulation in the Community of the product referred to in paragraph 1 shall be subject to the provision of a security, equivalent to the amount of the provisional duty. 4.
Article 2 Without prejudice to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, interested parties may request disclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which this Regulation was adopted, make their views known in writing and apply to be heard orally by the Commission within one month of the date of entry into force of this Regulation.
Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
