However, within each olive grove, the presence of pollinating varieties and old local varieties of olive trees, in particular Arabanier, Blanquetier, Blavet, Nostral and Ribeyrou, is permitted provided they are spaced out in a coordinated way and represent not more than 5 % of the number of trees in each cultivation unit in question.
The use of olives obtained from pollinating varieties and old local varieties is only permitted for the production of olive oil only on condition that the proportion of these olives does not exceed 5 % by volume of the olives used.
The area available for each tree must be not less than 24 m2.
Harvesting of the olives starts on a date fixed by order of the prefect on a proposal from the Institut national des appellations d'origine.
This has been achieved by the Cailletier variety for the "Huile d'olive de Nice" registered designation of origin.
History For over two thousand years the olive tree has been part of the landscape of Alpes-Maritimes where it grows in 102 of the department's 163 municipalities.
Originally located in coastal areas and hills following successive Phoenician, Greek and Roman invasions, olive cultivation developed over centuries in medium-elevation and upland areas to an altitude of 700 m.
For more than 25 years, driven by the activities of the professional organisations, the more efficient olive cultivation of Alpes-Maritimes has held steady and is expanding in the area behind the coast where it has been able to win back hillsides from flower cultivation.
