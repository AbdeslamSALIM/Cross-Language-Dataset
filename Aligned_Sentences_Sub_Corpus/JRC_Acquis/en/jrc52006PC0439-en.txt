The investigation revealed that DC-CFL-i and AC-CFL-i do not share the same basic physical and technical characteristics, and do not have the same basic end-uses.
The request was submitted by Steca Batterieladesysteme und Präzisionselektronik GmbH, an importer of CFL-i produced in the People’s Republic of China (‘the applicant’).
PRODUCT CONCERNED (11) The product concerned is, as defined in Article 1 of the original Regulation, CFL-i, currently classifiable within CN code ex 8539 31 90.
As a consequence, the electronic ballasts used in DC-CFL-i must have different components than the ones used in AC-CFL-i because they need to fulfil additional functions, namely to change the direct voltage into alternating voltage in order to ensure that light can be produced. (16) The Community industry argued that in the original investigation, the product produced in the analogue country (Mexico) was considered as a like product even if CFL-i produced in this country were destined for lower voltages.
CONCLUSION ON THE PRODUCT SCOPE (32) The above findings show that DC-CFL-i and AC-CFL-i do not share the same basic physical and technical characteristics, and do not have the same basic end-uses.
On this basis, it is concluded that DC-CFL-i and AC-CFL-i are two different products and the anti-dumping duty in force on imports of CFL-i originating in the PRC should not be applied to imports of DC-CFL-i.
REQUEST FOR RETROACTIVE APPLICATION (35) Given the conclusions in recitals (32) and (33) above that DC-CFL-i were not part of the product concerned in the original investigation leading to the imposition of anti-dumping measures on imports of CFL-i from the PRC, the clarification of the product scope should have a retroactive effect to the date of the imposition of the existing definitive anti-dumping duties. (36) Consequently, the definitive anti-dumping duties paid pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1470/2001 on imports of CFL-i in the Community should be reimbursed for those import transactions which were related to DC-CFL-i.
The definitive anti-dumping duty of 66,1 % imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1470/2001 on imports of electronic compact fluorescent discharge lamps functioning on alternating current (including electronic compact fluorescent discharge lamps functioning on both alternating and direct current), with one or more glass tubes, with all lightening elements and electronic components fixed to the lamp foot, or integrated in the lamp foot falling within CN code ex 8539 31 90 (TARIC code 8539 31 90*91 until 10 September 2004 and TARIC code 8539 31 90*95 from 11 September 2004 on), and originating in the People’s Republic of China, is hereby extended to electronic compact fluorescent discharge lamps functioning on alternating current (including electronic compact fluorescent discharge lamps functioning on both alternating and direct current), with one or more glass tubes, with all lightening elements and electronic components fixed to the lamp foot or integrated in the lamp foot consigned from Vietnam, Pakistan and/or the Philippines whether declared as originating in Vietnam, Pakistan or the Philippines or not (TARIC code 8539 31 90*92).” Article 3 1.
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and shall apply from 9 February 2001. 2.
