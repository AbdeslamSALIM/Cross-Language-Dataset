CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL, CONSULTATIONS On 29 May 2000 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters[1].
The Study emphasises the need for training of professionals involved in the application of the Regulation. - Finally, the Commission convened a meeting of the Advisory committee on the service of documents (provided for by Article 18 of the Regulation) in April 2004 in order to discuss the results of the Study as well as possible adaptations of the Regulation, and in order to gather further information from Member States on the functioning of the Regulation.
The Report concludes that since its entry into force in 2001, the application of the Regulation has generally improved and expedited the transmission and the service of documents between Member States.
This objective is in line with the Hague Programme strengthening Freedom, Security and Justice in the European Union adopted by the European Council on 4/5 November 2004.
Such delays for the transmission and service of documents between Member States are unacceptable in a European area of justice in civil and commercial matters.
The sentence “The period shall be calculated in accordance with the law of the Member State addressed” should be deleted since for the purpose of calculating the periods and time limits provided for in this Regulation, Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time limits shall apply (see recital 10). 2.
Paragraph 3 (Article 9) The purpose of the double date system in Article 9 is to protect the rights of both the applicant and the addressee.
For this reason, paragraph 3 can be deleted and the complex mechanism of communications under the current paragraph 3 can be replaced by a simpler and clearer provision. 4.
Paragraph 4 (Article 11) The issue of costs was already brought to the attention of the Commission soon after the entry into force of the Regulation, and has been the subject of extensive discussions on several occasions.
The Commission Report indicates that the application of this provision is not satisfactory, mainly due to the fact that in certain Member States the costs charged for the service of documents are very high (above 150 €) and not fully transparent (since the amounts are not known to the applicant beforehand).
Paragraph 5 (Article 14) This paragraph aims at further facilitating the application of the Regulation by introducing a uniform rule for all Member States concerning postal services.
This modification clarifies also that the language rules of Article 8 also apply for service by postal services[10]. 8.
Paragraph 8 (Articles 17 and 23) The requirement for the adoption of the manual of receiving agencies and the glossary by a Commission Decision (Article 17) should be deleted as well as the requirement of the publication of the information communicated by Member States in the Official Journal (Article 23).
Instead, this paragraph provides that a rule equivalent to Articles 19 and 22 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1206/2001 of 28 May 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters[11] is introduced since Articles 17 and 23 unnecessarily complicate making available the information communicated by Member States.
Furthermore, missing reference numbers of the transmitting and receiving agency and missing references to the new languages are added in the forms. 2005/0126 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 61 (c) and Article 67 paragraph 5 second indent thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[13], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[14], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[15], Whereas: (1) On 1 October 2004 the Commission adopted a report[16] on the application of Council Regulation (EC) 1348/2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters[17].
However, where according to the law of a Member State a document shall be served within a particular period in order to preserve the rights of the applicant, the date to be taken into account with respect to the applicant should be that fixed by the law of that Member State. (7) In order to facilitate access to justice, costs occasioned by the employment of a judicial officer or of a person competent under the law of the Member State addressed should correspond to a fixed fee laid down by that Member State in advance which respects the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination. (8) Each Member State should be free to effect service of judicial documents directly by postal services to persons residing in another Member State by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt or equivalent. (9) This Regulation should not interfere with the freedom of any person interested in a judicial proceeding to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the Member State addressed. (10) In calculating the periods and time limits provided for in Regulation (EC) 1348/2000, Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71[18] should apply. (11) Since the objectives of the action to be taken cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
However, where according to the law of a Member State a document shall be served within a particular period in order to preserve the rights of the applicant, the date to be taken into account with respect to the applicant shall be the date of service of the initial document.” (3) Article 9 is replaced by the following: “Article 9 Date of service 1.
