PROCEDURE (1) On 2 October 2003 Decree Law No 269 of 30 September 2003 providing for urgent measures to promote development and to correct the trend of public finances ("Decree-Law No 269/2003"), as subsequently converted into Law No 326 of 24 November 2003, published in the Official Gazette of the Italian Republic No 274 of 25 November 2003, entered into force on its publication in the Official Gazette of the Italian Republic No 229 of 2 October 2003.
Article 12 of Decree-Law No 269/2003 provides that the net operating result of certain undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities specialised in shares of small- and medium-capitalisation companies ("small- and mid-caps") listed on a regulated market in the European Union are subject to 5 % tax, instead of the standard 12,5 % tax withheld by non-specialised investment vehicles. (2) By letter dated 22 October 2003 (D/56756), the Commission called on the Italian authorities to provide information about the incentives in question and their entry into force with a view to ascertaining whether they constituted aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty.
On 19 December 2003 (D/58192) the Commission again reminded Italy of its obligations under Article 88(3) of the Treaty and invited the Italian authorities to inform those that might benefit from the incentives of the consequences provided for by the Treaty and by Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 [2] if the incentives in question were found to constitute aid unlawfully implemented without the prior authorisation of the Commission. (4) By letter of 11 May 2004 (SG 2004 D/202046), the Commission informed Italy of its decision of 7 May 2004 to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the Treaty in respect of the tax incentives granted by Italy by way of the scheme in question. (5) By letter of 14 July 2004 (A/35463), the Italian authorities submitted their comments. (6) On 9 September 2004 the Commission decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union, inviting interested parties to submit their comments [3]. (7) On 16 and 27 September 2004 two meetings took place between the Commission's representatives and the Italian tax authorities to examine certain aspects of the scheme. (8) By letter of 7 October 2004 (A/37679), the Italian Association of Asset Management Companies ("Assogestioni") submitted its comments.
By letter of 28 October 2004 (D/57696), the Commission forwarded the comments to the Italian authorities.
By letter of 6 December 2004 (A/39479), the Italian authorities responded to the comments from Assogestioni. (9) By letter of 18 February 2005 (A/31490), Assogestioni submitted further comments supplementing those sent on 7 October 2004.
DESCRIPTION OF THE MEASURE General framework (11) Article 12 of Decree-Law No 269/2003 introduces tax incentives for certain undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (investment vehicles) that are subject to Italian law.
In particular it stipulates that, as of the tax year in which certain conditions are met, the net operating result of those undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities that are specialised in shares of small- and mid-caps listed on a regulated market in the European Union (specialised investment vehicles) are subject to a 5 % tax, instead of the standard 12,5 % rate of tax.
As a general rule, this tax is in full discharge of tax liability, replacing any further tax on revenues distributed by investment vehicles. (21) The net operating result is determined by deducting from the fund's net assets at the end of the year, plus the substitute tax payable and any amounts distributed during the year, the fund's net assets at the beginning of the year and the revenue from participation in collective investment undertakings subject to the substitute tax, as well as exempt revenue and revenue subject to withholding tax [12]. (22) Article 12 of Decree-Law No 269/2003 amends the general tax system in that it provides for the levying of a 5 % substitute tax on the operating revenue of specialised investment vehicles.
Taxation of revenue accruing to investment vehicles subject to Italian substitute tax and acting as participants in other investment vehicles (23) Any revenue distributed by an investment vehicle subject to substitute tax in Italy to its participants (including other investment vehicles) is not subject to further taxation under the general system.
Taxation of operating income accrued or distributed to other participants in investment vehicles not subject to the substitute tax (24) Revenue distributed by Italian and foreign investment vehicles to Italian investors is not subject to further taxation in Italy because it has already been taxed at the level of the investment vehicle (withholding tax).
However, if the participating investor is a business undertaking acting as such, the revenue received is included in its taxable income subject to the 33 % rate of tax.
Such beneficiary undertakings qualify for a 15 % tax credit which offsets in full the double taxation of the capital revenue received.
The scheme essentially confirms the tax credit, even when the revenue is distributed by specialised investment vehicles [14]. (25) Revenue distributed by foreign investment vehicles to Italian investors is subject to a 12,5 % withholding tax pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Income Tax Code (TUIR).
The scheme reduces the withholding tax to 5 % for revenue distributed by specialised investment vehicles.
To eliminate double taxation of the income accruing to pension funds, a tax credit equal to 15 % of such revenue is imputed against the substitute tax payable by such pension funds.
The scheme adapts the new reduced-taxation arrangements for specialised investment vehicles to the specific tax system for pension funds. (27) In parallel with the lowering of the substitute tax on specialised investment vehicles, the scheme reduces to 6 % the tax credit for revenue deriving from Italian specialised investment vehicles.
Furthermore, Article 12 of Decree-Law No 269/2003 provides that the portion of the assets of pension funds generated by foreign specialised investment vehicles is subject to a 5 % substitute tax, instead of the standard 11 % [15].
The Commission further observed that the advantages in question are not proportionate to the number of shares in small- and mid-caps owned by such vehicles but are solely dependent on their status as specialised vehicles. (30) As regards small-caps the Commission stressed that the measure provides an indirect advantage for those companies whose shares are held by specialised investment vehicles, because it has the effect of increasing their liquidity by providing them with easier access to capital.
Assogestioni indicated that the tax cost of the scheme in 2004 was minimal.
On the basis of the data presented by Assogestioni, the Commission calculated that the shortfall in tax revenues in 2004 amounted to some â‚¬1,1 million, account being taken of the necessary adjustments to offset the carry-forward of the virtual tax credits relating to tax incurred in previous years.
Selective advantage for specialised investment vehicles (36) The Commission firstly confirms the view expressed in its letter opening the formal investigation procedure that, in some cases, investment vehicles are undertakings within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty and may accordingly benefit from the tax reduction provided for in Article 12 of Decree-Law No 269/2003.
In the case at hand, the Commission takes note of the comment by the Italian authorities to the effect that the specialised investment vehicles benefiting from the reduced tax pursuant to Article 12 of Decree-Law No 269/2003 are simply pools of assets and so cannot be regarded as undertakings within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty.
The Commission also considers that the fact that the advantage conferred by the scheme on investment undertakings managing specialised investment vehicles is only indirect cannot rule out the existence of state aid in so far as, according to the settled case law of the Court [22], direct tax advantages granted to investors who are not undertakings constitute indirect aid for the undertakings invested in. (41) The Commission accordingly concludes that the measure confers the specific indirect advantage mentioned above on specialised investment vehicles and their management companies, to the detriment of other undertakings offering alternative forms of investment.
Selective advantage for small- and mid-caps whose shares are held by specialised investment vehicles (42) The Commission also confirms the view expressed in its letter opening the formal investigation procedure that the effect of the scheme in question is to favour small- and mid-caps whose shares are held by specialised investment vehicles benefiting from the tax reduction provided for in Article 12 of Decree-Law No 269/2003.
In particular, it considers that the scheme confers an indirect selective advantage on small- and mid-caps whose shares are held by specialised investment vehicles consisting in the increased demand for their shares and in increased liquidity.
State resources (44) The Commission would point out that the advantages in question are granted by the State or through state resources.
As to the small- and mid-caps whose shares are held by the specialised investment vehicles described in Article 12 of Decree-Law No 269/2003, at least some of them are active in sectors where trade between Member States takes place. (46) The Commission considers that neither the limited tax expenditure on this scheme in 2004 (â‚¬1,1 million) nor the small number of specialised vehicles operating during that same year (three), as compared with the large number of listed small- and mid-caps whose shares have been held, can affect the conclusion that the measure constitutes aid firstly because, according to the settled case law of the Court [24], even a small amount of aid affects competition and secondly because it is not ruled out by Italy that the scheme in question may have a far more important economic impact in the future.
It also finds that Italy has unlawfully implemented the measure. (57) Where state aid is found to have been granted unlawfully and to be incompatible with the common market, the natural consequence is that the aid should be recovered in order to restore as far as possible the competitive position that existed before the aid was granted. (58) This decision concerns the scheme in question as such and must be immediately implemented, including recovery of the aid granted under the scheme pursuant to Article 14 of Procedural Regulation No 659/1999 [27]. (59) To this end, the Commission finds it necessary to ask Italy first to remove immediately the aid, which consists in the different tax treatment of their net operating result, in respect of the revenue accruing to investment vehicles specialised in shares of small- and mid-caps listed on regulated European markets by informing all those required by the relevant national rules of Article 12 of Decree-Law No 269/2003 to apply the tax incentives in question about the direct applicability of this Commission decision. (60) Secondly, Italy must recover the aid from the investment vehicles or from the undertakings managing contractual investment vehicles that are at the same time the first beneficiaries of the aid and the persons required by tax legislation to pay to the State the substitute tax on their net operating result.
Within two months of the date of notification of the present decision, the Italian Republic shall inform all the financial intermediaries, including the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities specialised in shares of small- and medium-capitalisation companies and all the other parties concerned by the application of the state aid scheme referred to in Article 1, of the Commission decision deeming the scheme to be incompatible with the common market. 2.
Interest shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter V of Commission Regulation (EC) No 794/2004.
Article 4 The Italian Republic shall inform the Commission, within two months of the date of notification of this decision, of the measures taken and planned to comply with it.
Article 5 This decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.
Done at Brussels, 6 September 2005.
For the Commission Neelie Kroes Member of the Commission [1] OJ C 225, 9.9.2004, p. 8. [2] OJ L 83, 27.3.1999, p. 1. [3] See footnote 1. [4] OJ L 375, 31.12.1985, p. 3. [5] The main difference between SICAVs (corporate funds) and contractual investment funds is that, in the case of SICAVs, there is no distinction between company capital and capital invested.
The participating shares in a SICAV are its capital. [6] The tax rate applicable to the net operating result of pension funds is not directly reduced by Article 12 of Decree-Law No 269/2003 because special tax rules apply to them.
In short, the 15 % tax credit makes it possible to avoid higher taxation at the level of the investor, resulting in an aggregate rate of tax of 5 %.
However, to prevent the participating investors from unduly benefiting from the full 15 % credit, while tax has been effectively paid at only 5 %, the scheme states that the tax credit constitutes a limited tax credit as regards the part not covered by the substitute tax on the accrued net operating result, i.e. 9 %, which cannot be reimbursed or used to offset income taxes due in tax years in which the revenue was taxed.
To grant relief against withholding tax, Italian tax law provides for a tax refund to foreign (non-resident) investors participating in investment vehicles subject to tax in Italy, which qualify for a tax refund equal to 15 % of the amount distributed by the investment vehicles offsetting the tax previously charged.
The scheme limits the refund to 6 % for distributions by specialised investment vehicles subject to the reduced substitute tax of 5 % under Article 12 of Decree-Law No 269/2003. [15] The effective 5 % substitute tax on the income accruing to pension funds from foreign specialised investment vehicles is realised because, under the specific tax provisions for pension funds, they may deduct from their net operating result, taxed at 11 %, the 54,55 % of the revenue distributed by a foreign specialised investment vehicle, with the result that applying the reduced rate of 11 % to 45,45 % corresponds to the imposition of a 5 % on total revenue.
On the other hand, the revenue accruing to pension funds from Italian specialised investment vehicles is subject to an 11 % substitute tax although it qualifies for a 6 % tax credit to offset the tax already paid by such specialised investment vehicles.
