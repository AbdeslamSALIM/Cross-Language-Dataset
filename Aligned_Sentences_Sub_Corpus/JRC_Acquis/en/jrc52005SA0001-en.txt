The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) succeeded the Unit for the Coordination of Fraud Prevention (UCLAF) in April 1999 with enhanced status and a mandate extended to cover all the institutions and bodies of the European Union.
The measures adopted in 2001 to provide the Office with staff competent to perform the duties of investigators have achieved all they can.
There is no independent guarantee of the legality of investigative procedures in progress or that the fundamental rights of persons under investigation are safeguarded.
Relations between the Office and its Supervisory Committee are difficult.
While emphasising the importance of OLAF’s investigative function (see paragraph 12), the Commission also entrusted the Office with a wide range of activities related to the protection of the European Union’s financial interests [4].
These activities, which are partly grouped into what the Office calls a "service platform", cover: (a) the assistance that the Commission gives the Member States in the fight against fraud; (b) the development of a strategy for fighting fraud within the framework of its policy on the protection of financial interests (Article 280 of the Treaty); (c) the preparation of the Commission’s legislative and regulatory anti-fraud initiatives; (d) the development of the necessary means to tackle fraud; (e) the collection and analysis of information; (f) technical assistance, especially in the field of training, to the other Community bodies and institutions and to the national authorities concerned with the protection of the Community’s financial interests.
These bodies fall into three subgroups: (a) those located in the Member States or third countries, such as police forces, judicial authorities and administrative anti-fraud authorities; (b) Community bodies, such as the Investigation and Discipline Office of the Commission (IDOC) [5], each institution’s internal audit service, the European Ombudsman, the audit capabilities of the Commission’s operational departments and OLAF’s own Supervisory Committee; (c) other intergovernmental crime prevention bodies, such as Eurojust and Europol. 4.
At the same time, UCLAF’s staff were reassigned en bloc to the Office, which, until the 2001 overhaul of the establishment plan, limited the new Director’s room for manoeuvre [8].
Organisation of OLAF 6.
In 2004, the Investigations Directorate (Directorate B) comprised 126 investigators [11] and 13 administrative staff.
The remaining 193 posts were divided among the Office’s other departments (Directorate A "Policy, legislation and legal affairs" and Directorate C "Intelligence, operational strategy and information services").
Although the Office’s recent organisation was analysed, along with a sample of 117 operations conducted or closed towards the end of 2003, it became clear that, at that time, the Office was still engaged on clearing numerous operations begun by its predecessor, and that the reorganisation measures introduced during the 2002-2003 period were just starting to have an effect.
Apart from coordination operations, Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 distinguishes between external investigations (Article 3) and internal investigations (Article 4).
The Office itself divides its cases into five categories: (a) internal investigations (investigations of corruption within the institutions and assimilated bodies); (b) external investigations (direct investigations of third parties involved in activities related to Community budget transactions); (c) judicial support (support for national authorities in the context of criminal proceedings); (d) coordination (support for the Member States in the context of investigations concerning more than one country); (e) monitoring cases (the aim is to allow the Office, where important cases are concerned, to check whether the Member States are fulfilling their obligations under Article 280 of the Treaty). 13.
Cases at the active investigation stage (475 as at 30 September 2004) include actual investigations (252) and coordination and assistance operations (223).
Coordination operations are particularly common in the field of revenue and shared-management expenditure.
Consequently, out of the 23 cases examined during the audit of the customs and trade sectors, four were investigations led by the Office. 14.
As at 30 September 2004, 475 cases were in active investigation; (c) a third stage, conducted outside the Investigation Directorate, is dedicated to the follow-up of cases transmitted to the judicial authorities and those requiring recovery of funds.
As at 30 September 2004, 649 cases were at the follow-up stage.
The introduction of the case management system (CMS) by the Office in 2002 made it easier for it to log investigations [19].
There have in fact been cases categorised as ongoing investigations although, in the absence of further investigative acts, the cases concerned should have been closed either with or without follow-up.
Setting of priorities for OLAF’s investigative function 18.
Sector | Average number of denunciations per month | Proportion of denunciations per month | Anti-corruption | 5 | 9 % | Direct expenditure | 8 | 15 % | External aid | 12 | 23 % | Agriculture | 12 | 23 % | Structural Funds | 7 | 13 % | Customs | 9 | 17 % | Total | 53 | 100 % | The assessment stage 20.
Although between October 2002 and September 2004 the proportion of assessments already in progress for more than four months fell significantly, from 62 % to 35 %, they still numbered 68.
The investigation stage 23.
In many cases the delays cannot be explained. 25.
On the other hand, the Office often requests information from the investigative agencies of certain Member States, notably Italy.
The follow-up stage 30.
OLAF distinguishes between five kinds of follow-up: (a) financial follow-up, which is intended to ensure the recovery of funds misappropriated from the Community budget; (b) administrative follow-up, which aims to improve the procedures for the management of budgetary revenue and expenditure; (c) judicial follow-up, which aims to provide information on the progress of criminal proceedings and the presentation, where appropriate, of claims for damages by the institutions concerned; (d) disciplinary follow-up, which takes the form of determining what action the institutions intend to take in response to the Office’s recommendations [26]; (e) legislative follow-up, the purpose of which is to amend Community legislation in order to render it less susceptible to fraud. 31.
In general, the Office’s follow-up activity has provided little added value, especially where coordination and assistance were concerned (see Annex II).
The Office’s role in financial follow-up should be limited to calculating the amounts of the sums to be recovered.
Investigation results are still poorly interpreted.
Internal audit 38.
The OLAF Executive Board 40.
Activity reports 42.
The Office submits an annual activity report, the Commission presents an annual report on the implementation of its policy for the protection of its financial interests, OLAF’s Supervisory Committee draws up an annual report and Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 requires an evaluation of the Office’s activities after three years of existence. 43.
In order to account for its activities in a way that is both transparent and relevant, the Office should identify and regularly update indicators which focus not just on the volume of its activity but also on the results (success or failure) of its investigations [32] (see paragraph 39), including those conducted in collaboration with the competent authorities in the Member States.
It is still difficult to determine what the effective results of investigations have been.
Although this unit has been in existence for two years, its interventions to date have had no direct impact on investigation activity [35]. 47.
The following two activities would be better placed in other Commission services: (a) operation of the anti-fraud information system (AFIS), which allows Member States as well as OLAF to receive and disseminate information about fraud [37]; (b) management of programmes financed by the general budget of the European Union and aimed at reinforcing the infrastructure of customs services in the Member States.
Directorate A comprises six units (see Annex I).
In addition to the internal audit service, four units report directly to the Director of the Office (see Annex I).
Magistrates Unit 57.
Although reporting to the Director of the Office, this unit is supposed to play two roles closely linked to the investigative function: (a) to support investigations in matters relating to specific features of the judicial systems in Member States; (b) to ensure, when cases are transferred to national judicial authorities, a smooth transfer of the Office’s files to public prosecutors in the countries concerned. 58.
The Magistrates Unit has had little involvement in evaluation and investigation work.
As part of the enlargement of the Union, a special unit was given responsibility for implementing a 15 million euro programme financed by the PHARE programme.
This activity is scheduled to continue in principle until 2006.
In 2004, it was given responsibility for a further support programme for new Member States (the Hercules programme, with funding of 11,7 million euro).
The sharp increase in the number of posts since 1999 reflects the budgetary authority’s determination to strengthen the Office’s investigative function.
In the list of posts for 2004, these posts accounted for 55 % of the total for categories A and B.
This exercise was all the more difficult as, unlike the practice at DG Competition and DG Trade [40], the Office provides only limited initial training to the investigators it recruits; (b) most of the temporary contracts now in progress will come to the end of their second and final three-year term between 2007 and 2009 [41].
In practice, using recital 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 as a basis, the Committee has concentrated its attention on one of its own rules of procedure, under which it states that it will ensure that the Office respects the principles of individual rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly with regard to internal investigations [45]. 67.
For example, between September 2003 and May 2004, the Committee debated the Ombudsman’s interventions in connection with individual investigations by the Office during seven of its meetings.
Nevertheless, since informing the judicial authorities is often a stage in an investigation which continues with these authorities’ support, and since informing them is a sovereign act by the Director of the Office, prior communication to the Committee may be a source of interference; (d) in its Rules of Procedure the Committee asks the Director to grant it rights which go beyond those provided for in its legal constitution (communication of complaints received by the Director [48], communication of the Office’s legislative initiatives concerning the fight against fraud and the protection of financial interests [49], access to all OLAF’s documents and files [50], its own budgetary resources [51], appointment of secretariat staff [52], determining the secretariat’s place of work [53], etc.). 70.
The Committee’s focus of attention on internal investigations and individual rights has affected the relationship between the Director of the Office and the Committee. 71.
To allow it to discuss questions relating to the conduct of enquiries in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee secretariat examines closed investigation files which it selects on the basis of criteria determined in consultation with the Chairman.
The number of files examined recently was 17 [56] in 2003 and seven in the first six months of 2004.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 73.
The Office undertook substantial reorganisation measures in November 2003.
Similarly, guidelines on the results to be achieved are still vague because the disciplinary or financial aspects may be overlooked in favour of judicial processes, the outcome of which is often remote and uncertain (see paragraphs 19, 20 and 25).
The fact that coordination and assistance operations are treated as equivalent to investigations makes control of resources difficult and results in time-consuming use of the CMS system, even though the Office has no obligation, in coordination and assistance cases, to collect and produce evidence itself (see paragraphs 13 and 14).
The Executive Board has not insisted strongly enough on the need for clear formulation of the objectives and expected results of investigations (see paragraphs 20 and 22).
Supervision of investigations by the Office’s management has generally proved inadequate (see paragraphs 28, 35 and 36).
The obligation to report investigations that are more than nine months old to the Supervisory Committee has had no notable effect (see paragraph 24).
Taking into account the time-barring periods laid down in national (criminal) and Community legislation (e.g.
It is still difficult to determine the actual results of investigations.
Judicial and legal routes have in the main proved ineffective (see paragraph 37). 82.
The Office’s financial follow-up operations use up a lot of its resources (see paragraphs 31 and 54).
Judicial follow-up adds little value to the conclusions submitted (see paragraph 43).
Judicial follow-up should be limited solely to cases where, after criminal proceedings, the officer who authorised the original expenditure is required to start civil proceedings for recovery.
Such a code should have legal force, be published and allow the fundamental principles governing OLAF’s investigations, in particular transparency and the adversarial principle, to be applied transparently. 84.
Some Member States give their support to the Office more willingly than others, even though the Office does not have all the means at its disposal to identify certain facts (see paragraphs 15 and 37). 85.
In the areas of own resources and shared-management expenditure, cooperation with Member States under ad hoc rules and mutual assistance procedures (Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96) is often mediocre (see paragraphs 15 and 32).
The case management system (CMS and registry) established by the Office represents distinct progress in the control of documentation and investigation files (see paragraph 17). 87.
The CMS databases are not used to their best advantage to create a genuine system of investigation management and a decision-making aid, although such an instrument is needed to manage and direct investigations (see paragraphs 34 and 36).
Considerable resources are invested in producing reports which do not always result in sufficiently clear information to judge the Office’s effectiveness in the absence of relevant performance indicators (see paragraphs 37, 39 and 43).
Deployment of resources in support of investigations 89.
The Office’s reactive investigation policy does not allow it to form an overview of its future workload and to organise its investigative teams accordingly (see paragraphs 26 and 62).
The process of allocating staff between units in the Investigations Directorate is not transparent.
Staff management is complicated by the disproportionate number of temporary posts, which results in instability (see paragraphs 63 and 64).
It is legitimate on the other hand to question the contribution which work related to the strategy for the protection of financial interests makes to the Office’s investigations (see paragraphs 53 and 55).
Since work in relation to the strategy for the protection of financial interests has had no direct impact on the conduct of investigations, other Commission services could be better placed to undertake such work. 92.
When such activities involve taking on responsibilities which are normally carried out by the operational services of the Commission (programme management, for example) mobilisation of the Office’s resources does not constitute the best solution (see paragraphs 55 and 59).
Relations between OLAF and the Supervisory Committee 93.
The role of the Supervisory Committee should be re-examined in order to avoid all risks of interference in ongoing investigations.
This Report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg at its meeting of 9 June 2005.

Investigations and assistance and coordination operations share the same objective: the protection of financial interests.
Consequently, the Court’s observation regarding the inadequacy of the supervision should be qualified (between July 2000 and June 2003 957 cases inherited from UCLAF were closed and in three years the average length of investigations dropped from 33 months to 22 months in 2004).
This cooperation is also a concern for the Commission and has been described as a platform of multidisciplinary services in recommendation 14 of the Commission report on the evaluation of the activities of OLAF [4].
Activities following-up investigations, such as recovery or prosecutions, provide only a partial picture of OLAF’s effectiveness.
With this objective in mind, the mobilisation of resources for operations is the top priority.
The Commission welcomes the Court’s observations, although this is without prejudice to any future re-assessment the Commission may make concerning the division of responsibilities between its services, particularly in the framework of the evaluation of the tasks/competencies of OLAF.
OLAF refers to the Complementary Assessment of the European Anti-Fraud Office (2004) [6], which points out that operational tasks account for some 60 % of its resources.
This can be explained by the fact that a significant proportion of resources allocated to units outside the Investigations and Operations Directorate (B) is closely linked to investigative activities. 8.
The deficiencies summarised in Annex II must therefore be relativised, as they primarily concern investigations opened prior to the reorganisation of the Office in November 2003.
OLAF INVESTIGATIONS 13.
Within the legal framework for OLAF’s activities, direct intervention in the form of an investigation conducted by the Office may be less common in the fields of customs and trade (see reply to paragraphs IV, 4 and 12). 14.
The new OLAF manual, which was adopted on 25 February 2005, has taken account of the fact that it may be impossible to produce an effective initial assessment of information in 15 days in areas where cooperation is needed with Member States.
As stated in the Complementary Evaluation, the average duration of OLAF investigations has decreased from 33 months in 2002 to 22 months in 2004 (see reply to paragraph 78) [12]. 24.
In Article 6(7) of the proposal for an amendment to Regulations (EC) No 1073/1999 and (Euratom) No 1074/1999 the Commission suggests consolidating the management of investigations by imposing maximum time limits for conducting investigations.
Moreover, in its plan of activities for 2005, OLAF plans to introduce a system for monitoring the use of its investigators’ time that will reduce the time spent on investigations (see replies to paragraphs 26 and 80). 25.
The proposed amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 codify defence rights.
Finally, OLAF’s role in arranging files prior to forwarding them to the national judicial authorities is very important as it ensures optimal handling by the authorities concerned. 29.
OLAF made quality control one of its priorities for 2005 and has organised training on the subject (see reply to paragraph 29).
The new OLAF manual of 25 February 2005 provides further clarification on most of the issues mentioned by the Court, including the role of the Board.
The decision that the investigation warrants further follow-up by the appropriate authorities should be taken into account when evaluating OLAF activities as the Office considers a fraud/irregularity has taken place.
However, OLAF does exclude the possibility of reorganising the Board to make the consultation procedure more effective (see replies to paragraphs 77 and 58). 42.
To provide a clearer picture of the judicial follow-up to OLAF recommendations, relevant information regarding judicial and disciplinary follow-up and their results have been reported in a coherent way at the end of the follow-up procedure in the CMS since 2004 (see also the reply to paragraph 37 regarding OLAF’s absence of control on national procedures or disciplinary procedures).
The Complementary Evaluation of OLAF’s activities provides an initial indication of OLAF’s results in terms of operations, financial impact and cooperation with the judicial authorities [14] (see reply to paragraph 8).
The Commission considers the breakdown of responsibilities between Directorates-General and OLAF regarding recovery and following-up irregularities is sufficiently clear.
In the agricultural sector (regarding CAP), responsibilities between OLAF and the Directorate-General for Agriculture are defined according to Annex 2 to the Communication of the Commission SEC(1995)249 of 10 February 1995 (see also the reply of the Commission to the Court of Auditors’ Special Report No 3/2004).
For the structural measures sector, OLAF is also responsible for the management of all irregularity notifications by the Member States in application of Regulations (EC) Nos 1681/94 and 1831/94 and OLAF works in cooperation with the authorising Directorates-General (Agriculture and Rural Development; Regional Policy; Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities; and Fisheries and Maritime Affairs).
In the customs sector, Commission Decisions in 1995 and 1999 have clearly defined the responsibilities of UCLAF/OLAF and Taxation and Customs Union Directorate-General.
The Magistrates Unit is now involved upstream in the process of evaluating cases in all sectors where there is a likelihood of criminal proceedings ensuing (see reply to paragraph 77). 59.
OLAF’s experience is useful in assisting candidate countries to adopt in an effective way the acquis communautaire in the field of the protection of the Communities’ financial interests, which arises from Article 280 of the EC Treaty.
While reflecting on OLAF’s activities, however, the Commission could devote some thought to this matter. 60.
In 2005, particular attention has been given to the training of new staff (see reply to paragraph 63(a)), but OLAF intends to place greater priority on internal training and is planning to give training a higher profile in its structure. 63.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 74.
Nevertheless, the Commission has called on the bodies concerned to consider the Office’s strategic priorities (see recommendation 11 of the report on the evaluation of the activities of the European Anti-fraud Office) [16].
OLAF has conducted an initial analysis of its results in the Complementary Evaluation of the activities of OLAF (2004).
The Office intends to develop this study and consider which performance indicators would be most suitable in the light of best practice in national agencies (see replies to paragraphs VII and 8). 76.
Moreover, assistance and coordination operations, which are often complex, need rigorous internal procedures (see replies to paragraphs 13 and 14).
As part of the work being undertaken with a view to reforming OLAF’s workings and organisation, OLAF could examine methods of developing an administrative structure that better reflects the distinction between assistance and coordination operations, on the one hand, and investigations, on the other. 77.
The CMS Board module implemented in 2005 facilitates this involvement.
The average duration of investigations has fallen steadily, to 22 months in 2004 (see replies to paragraphs V, 20(b), 23, 33, 35, 36 and 87).
To enable Heads of Unit to manage investigation priorities more effectively OLAF is studying the possibility of setting up a system for monitoring of the use of investigators’ time (see replies to paragraphs 25 and 79).
Moreover, a system for monitoring the use of time staff in the follow-up units is currently being tested (see replies to paragraphs 24 to 26). 80.
The Commission has addressed the question of a maximum period for investigations in its proposal to amend Regulations (EC) No 1073/1999 and (Euratom) No 1074/1999 which calls for a duration of 12 months with the possibility of extending investigations by up to six months at a time on the basis of a decision taken by the Director after consulting the Supervisory Committee [17]. 81.
See replies to paragraphs 37 and 43.
See also the reply to paragraph 29. 82.
The value added by judicial follow-up is not confined to the contribution made by the magistrates when forwarding the files to the judicial authorities; it arises in connection with all complementary matters related to the various disciplinary or judicial procedures (such as requests for waivers of immunities or the duty to exercise discretion of officials and requests for legal aid).
With regard to recovery, the Commission has chosen to add OLAF’s expertise to that of the authorising officers (see replies to paragraphs 31 and 54).
The Office points out that it is involved in fraud-proofing upstream of the legislative process (see reply to paragraph 91). 83.
The Office has made the improvement of operational contacts one of its priorities for 2005 (see replies to paragraphs 15 and 37). 85.
Article 3 of the proposal to amend Regulations (EC) No 1073/1999 and (Euratom) No 1074/1999, which were presented in February 2004, and recommendation No 5 of the Commission’s Article 15 report (extending memoranda of understanding concluded between OLAF and the national authorities) are steps in this direction. 87.
The CMS has the attributes necessary to become a valuable instrument for continuous case management but improvements need to be made in the way it is used (see reply to paragraph 17).
To improve the quality of its activity reports and the evaluation of its effectiveness, OLAF has embarked on a study of performance indicators, drawing on the experience of national investigation agencies (see replies to paragraphs 8 and 37).
The Court’s recommendation on this subject is in line with recommendation No 5 of the report on the evaluation of the activities of the European Anti-fraud Office [19].
However, the Commission could undertake a general reflection on the definition of OLAF’s responsibilities with regard to these programmes. 93.
ANNEX REPLIES BY THE OLAF SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE The role of the Supervisory Committee (paragraph 66) The Supervisory Committee controls the method of conducting investigations "with full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the principle of fairness, for the right of persons involved to express their views on the facts concerning them and for the principle that the conclusions of an investigation may be based solely on elements which have evidential value" (see recital 10 of the basic Regulation).
The Supervisory Committee and the independence of the Office (paragraphs 67 and 70) The independence enjoyed by the Office, and its Director, when performing its investigative duties is one of the most significant new developments brought in by Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999.
