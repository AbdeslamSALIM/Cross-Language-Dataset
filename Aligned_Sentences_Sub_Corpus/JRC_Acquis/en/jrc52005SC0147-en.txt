Recommendation for a Council opinion in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated convergence programme of Poland, 2004-2007 /* SEC/2005/0147 final */ Brussels, 2.2.2005 SEC(2005) 147 final Recommendation for a COUNCIL OPINION in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated convergence programme of Poland, 2004-2007 (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies[1] stipulates that non-participating Member States, that is, those which have not adopted the single currency, have to submit convergence programmes to the Council and the Commission.
The Member States that joined the EU on 1 May 2004 do not participate in the single currency, but are required to fulfil in due time the convergence criteria, including the one on the sustainability of the government financial position, in order to qualify for the adoption of the euro.
In view of a general government deficit of 3.9% of GDP recorded in 2003, the Council decided that Poland was in excessive deficit on 5 July 2004 and recommended that the excessive deficit be corrected by 2007 at the latest in line with the May 2004 convergence programme.
The Member States which joined the EU on 1 May 2004 committed themselves to submitting their convergence programmes by 15 May 2004 and a first update thereof towards the end of 2004.
The first convergence programme of Poland, covering the period 2004-2007, was submitted on 17 May 2004 and assessed by the Council on 5 July 2004.
Poland submitted an update of its convergence programme on 1 December 2004.
This evaluation warrants the following assessment: - Poland submitted to the European Commission its updated convergence programme covering the period 2004-2007 on 1 December 2004, following the approval by the Council of Ministers on 30 November 2004.
Accordingly, Poland is invited to achieve compliance with the data requirements. - The macroeconomic framework presented in the programme predicts a deceleration in real GDP growth from 5.7% in 2004 to 5.0% and 4.8% in 2005 and 2006, respectively, followed by a rebound to 5.6% in 2007.
The macroeconomic scenario up to 2006 is plausible and is close to the Commission services autumn 2004 forecasts, although the latter predict a somewhat lower GDP growth for 2006.
In particular, the programme assumes a strengthening of potential growth from 3.6% in 2004 to 4.7% in 2007 (according to Commission services calculations), resulting in an estimated output gap of over 2% at the end of the programme period.
The surge in inflation observed between April and August 2004 was mostly due to temporary factors (food and oil prices, accession-related tax increases), while continued moderate wage growth and a stronger zloty help to underpin prospects for a slowing of inflation in 2005.
The zloty appreciated strongly during most of 2004, gaining some 13% against the euro relative to December 2003.
a direct inflation targeting framework combined with a floating exchange rate regime, is foreseen. - The budgetary strategy underlying the updated programme aims at reducing the general government deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2007 and maintaining the debt ratio below 60% of GDP.
The update foresees a gradual reduction of the deficit to 2.2% of GDP in 2007 from 5.4% of GDP in 2004.
The open pension funds (estimated annual impact of 1.5% of GDP) are classified within the general government sector as allowed by the transition period granted by Eurostat.
Compared with the previous programme, the most significant difference is the upward revision of the general government deficit target in 2007 by 0.7 percentage points of GDP, despite the projected rebound in economic growth.
The fiscal consolidation would result from the implementation of a comprehensive set of measures contained in the Hausner plan, which, if fully implemented, would have an estimated total budgetary impact of 4.7% of GDP over the period 2005-2007 (revised downwards by 0.6 percentage points compared with the previous programme). - The reduction of the headline deficit between 2004 and 2007 is less ambitious than in the May convergence programme and amounts to 3.2 instead of 4.2 percentage points.
With a change in classification in 2007, the deficit figures for each year will be adjusted upwards by 1.5 percentage points.
Based on the risk assessment, the budgetary outcome could be worse than projected. - The government debt ratio is projected to increase by a cumulative 2.6 percentage points between 2004 and 2006 to peak at 48% of GDP at the end of 2006, before declining by 0.8 percentage points in 2007.
The Commission services autumn 2004 forecasts show a less favourable debt development.
The classification of the open pension funds outside the general government sector in accordance with the Eurostat ruling would lead to an increase in the debt figures by about 6 percentage points on average each year over the period 2005-2007.
In order to bring the deficit below 3% of GDP in 2007 in a credible and sustainable manner, it should ensure a full implementation of the structural measures contained in the Hausner plan and take additional fiscal consolidation measures.
The quality of ESA95 data on the composition of the general government revenue and expenditure are not fully in line with ESA95 statistical standards.
The programme also deviates from the data requirements in the area of the long-term sustainability of public finances.
The macro-economic scenario underlying the programme envisages real GDP growth to decelerate from 5.7% in 2004 to 4.9% on average in 2005 and 2006, before rebounding to 5.6% in 2007.
If the growth projections for 2005 and 2006 are plausible, the growth forecast for the last year of the programme appears on the high side.
In particular, the projected acceleration in GDP growth in 2007 reflects optimistic assumptions about the growth of potential output and the strength of domestic demand.
The budgetary strategy underlying the updated programme aims at reducing the general government deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2007 and maintaining the debt ratio below 60% of GDP.
The update foresees a gradual reduction of the deficit to 2.2% of GDP in 2007 from 5.4% of GDP in 2004, including the surplus of the open pension funds (estimated annual impact of 1.5% of GDP).
Compared with the previous programme, the most significant difference is the upward revision of the general government deficit target in 2007 by 0.7 percentage points of GDP, despite the projected rebound in economic growth.
In addition, the funded pension scheme continues to be recorded inside the general government sector as allowed by the transition period granted by Eurostat.
Hence, in the absence of additional savings measures, the fulfilment of the Council recommendation to bring the deficit below 3% in the end year of the programme is not ensured, based on the new 2007 deficit target of 2.2% of GDP.
The programme projects the debt ratio to increase by a cumulative 1.8 percentage points over the period 2004-2007, with the increase coming to a halt only in the last year of the programme.
Thus, a successful implementation of the planned measures, a strict monitoring of outstanding contingent liabilities and the resolute implementation of the planned budgetary consolidation in the medium term should contribute to a sustainable position in the longer term.
