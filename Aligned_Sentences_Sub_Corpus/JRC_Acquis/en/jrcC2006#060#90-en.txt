Pleas in law and main arguments The object of the present action is the partial annulment of the Commission Decision of 20 October 2005 relating to a proceeding under Article 81 EC (Case COMP/C-38.281/B.2 — Raw tobacco — Italy), limited to the part concerning the calculation of the fine imposed on the applicant, and the resulting reduction of the said fine.
In that decision, the defendant found that six undertakings operating in Italy in the raw tobacco processing sector had infringed Article 81(1) EC from 1995 until the beginning of 2002, by means of concerted agreements or practices aimed at coordinating their individual purchasing strategies, including through the organisation of regular information exchanges and mutual consultation.
The cartel extended to include concerted action on bids in response to public competitive procedures organised by AIMA-Azienda di Stato (the State Corporation AIMA) in 1995 for action to be taken on the agricultural market and by ATI-Azienda Tabacchi Italiani S.p.A.
