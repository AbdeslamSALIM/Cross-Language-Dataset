2006/713/EC: Commission Decision of 20 October 2006 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of recordable digital versatile discs (DVD+/-R) originating in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan Commission Decision of 20 October 2006 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of recordable digital versatile discs (DVD+/-R) originating in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan (2006/713/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Communities [1] (%quot%the basic Regulation%quot%), and in particular Article 9 thereof, After consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: A.
Initiation (1) On 6 August 2005, the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2] the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding with regard to imports into the Community of recordable digital versatile discs (%quot%DVD+/-R%quot%) originating in the People’s Republic of China (%quot%PRC%quot%), Hong Kong and Taiwan (%quot%the countries concerned%quot%). (2) The proceeding was initiated as a result of a complaint lodged on 24 June 2005 by CECMA (%quot%the complainant%quot%) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 60 %, of the total Community production of DVD+/-R.
In accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation, the sample was based on the largest representative volume of exports which can reasonably be investigated within the time available.
The samples selected consisted respectively of four Chinese exporting producers, representing 79 % of the export volume of the Chinese co-operating parties and five Taiwanese exporting producers, representing 97 % of the export volume of the Taiwanese cooperating parties.
Investigation Period (10) The investigation period of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 (%quot%IP%quot%).
The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the period from 1 January 2002 to the end of the investigation period (%quot%period considered%quot%). 4.
Product concerned and like product 4.1.
Product concerned (11) The product concerned is recordable digital versatile discs (%quot%DVD+/-R%quot%) originating in the PRC, Hong Kong and Taiwan normally declared within CN code ex85239030 (CN code since 1 January 2006).
This code covers products with a recording capacity exceeding 900 megabytes but not exceeding 18 gigabytes, other than erasable.
DVD+/-Rs consist normally of two 0,6 mm thick polycarbonate substrate of 120 mm or less, glued together.
COMMUNITY INTEREST 5.
General remarks (21) In accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation it was examined whether, despite the conclusion on injurious dumping, compelling reasons exist for concluding that it is not in the Community interest to adopt anti-dumping measures in this particular case.
The likely impact of possible measures on all parties involved as well as the likely consequences of not taking measures were considered. (22) The definition of Community production and Community industry has followed the criteria set out in Articles 4(1) and 5(4) of the basic Regulation. (23) In this case, the following related companies have been considered to constitute the Community industry: - Computer Support Italcard s.r.l. (%quot%CSI%quot%) - Manufacturing Advanced Media (%quot%MAME%quot%). (24) In the complaint, one more company was also mentioned as complainant.
However, in view of the conclusions reached below, it was not considered necessary to take a decision on this issue. (27) Therefore, only CSI and MAME, whose collective output constitutes 88 % of the total estimated Community production, constitute the Community industry within the meaning of Articles 4(1) and 5(4) of the basic Regulation. 6.
Interest of the Community industry, unrelated importers, users and consumers (28) Based on information gathered from the interested parties, the evolution of total consumption in the Community and market shares of the Community industry during the period considered have developed as follows below: EU consumption Thousands of units | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Total EU consumption | 10570 | 602390 | 1575562 | 1687509 | Index (2002 = 100) | 100 | 5700 | 14906 | 15965 | Total EU consumption of the product concerned increased massively by almost 16000 percentage points.
Market shares on the Community market | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Community Industry | 0 % | 0,4 % | 0,6 % | 0,8 % | Cooperating producers excluded from the definition of the Community production (see recitals (24) to (25) above) | 6,3 % | 1,0 % | 3,1 % | 5,1 % | Other non-cooperating producers in the Community still in operation (estimation) | 0 % | 0,5 % | 0,2 % | 0,2 % | Imports from the countries concerned | 93,7 % | 87,6 % | 89,0 % | 86,1 % | Imports from other third countries | 0 % | 10,5 % | 7,1 % | 7,8 % | (29) On the basis of the facts provided above, it appears that the Community industry’s share of the Community market started from 0 % in 2000 but still only reached 0,8 % in the IP.
The market share of imports from the countries concerned decreased in the period considered, but was still at a level of around 87 % during the IP.
As the mark-up of the importers/wholesalers in these countries can be estimated at around 4 %, the imposition of anti-dumping duties would significantly decrease the already small margin. (34) Adversely, in Member States with the lowest (or absence of) special levies, it is more likely that a substantial part of the cost increase is passed on to consumers.
The argument was therefore rejected. (38) Moreover, while Article 21 of the basic Regulation indeed refers to the need to give special consideration to the need to remedy the trade distorting effects of injurious dumping and to restore effective competition, this particular provision has to be seen in the overall framework of the Community interest test as laid down in the aforementioned Article.
