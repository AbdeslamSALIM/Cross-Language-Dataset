This Directive: - in pursuance of Article 6 (1) of Directive 76/464/EEC, lays down limit values for emission standards for mercury in discharges from industrial plants as defined in Article 2 point (d) of this Directive, - in pursuance of Article 6 (2) of Directive 76/464/EEC, lays down quality objectives for mercury in the aquatic environment, - in pursuance of Article 6 (4) of Directive 76/464/EEC, lays down the time limits for compliance with the conditions of the authorizations granted by the competent authorities of Member States in the case of existing discharges, - in pursuance of Article 12 (1) of Directive 76/464/EEC, lays down the reference methods of measurement enabling the mercury content in discharges and in the aquatic environment to be determined, - in pursuance of Article 6 (3) of Directive 76/464/EEC, establishes a monitoring procedure, - requires Member States to cooperate with one another in the case of discharges affecting the waters of more than one Member State. 2.
From the information supplied to it by the Member States pursuant to Article 13 of Directive 76/464/EEC on receipt of a request which it must submit in each case, in particular concerning: - details of authorizations laying down emission standards with regard to discharges of mercury, - results of measurements made by the national network set up to determine concentrations of mercury, the Commission shall make a comparative assessment of the implementation of the present Directive by the Member States. 2.
Article 7 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
TINDEMANS (1) OJ No L 129, 18. 5. 1976, p. 23. (2) OJ No C 169, 6. 7. 1979, p. 2. (3) OJ No C 341, 31. 12. 1980, p. 24. (4) OJ No C 83, 2. 4. 1980, p. 16.
This procedure must provide for: - the taking each day of a sample representative of the discharge over a period of 24 hours and the measurement of the mercury concentration of that sample, and - the measurement of the total flow of the discharge over that period.
ANNEX II Quality objectives For those Member States which apply the exception provided for in Article 6 (3) of Directive 76/464/EEC, the emission standards which Member States must establish and ensure are applied, pursuant to Article 5 of that Directive, shall be fixed so that the appropriate quality objective or objectives from among those listed below is or are complied with in the area affected by discharges of mercury from the chlor-alkali electrolysis industry.
Flow measurement must be carried out to an accuracy of Â± 20 %.
In accordance with Article 6 (3) of Directive 76/464/EEC, the Member State shall report to the Commission for each quality objective chosen and applied, on: - the points of discharge and the means of dispersal, - the area in which the quality objective is applied, - the location of sampling points, - the frequency of sampling, - the methods of sampling and of measurement, - the results obtained. 3.
