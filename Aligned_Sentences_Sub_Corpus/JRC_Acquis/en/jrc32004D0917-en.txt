On the contrary, it occurred in a context of strong economic growth at 4,2 % in 2003, and a positive output gap of around 1,5 % of GDP.
Moreover, in its Spring 2004 forecasts, the Commission projects the debt ratio to decline only marginally to 102,8 % of GDP in 2004, which is above the 98,3 % of GDP reported by the Greek authorities on 4 May 2004.
The deficit figure for 2003 of 3,2 % of GDP in the notification of 4 May compares with a deficit of 1,7 % of GDP notified in early March, which was modified to 2,95 % of GDP at the end of the same month, following the new government√¢&#x20AC;&#x2122;s initiative for a far-reaching auditing of public finances.
