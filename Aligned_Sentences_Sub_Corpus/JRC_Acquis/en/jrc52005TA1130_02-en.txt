Statement of Assurance by the Court of Auditors on the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth European Development Funds (EDFs) for the financial year 2004 Statement of Assurance by the Court of Auditors on the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth European Development Funds (EDFs) for the financial year 2004 (2005/C 303/02) I — The European Court of Auditors (the Court) has examined the accounts of the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth EDFs and the underlying transactions for the financial year ending 31 December 2004.
II — Reliability of the accounts Except for the effects of the problems concerning: (a) the incompleteness of the assets, as the Commission has not sufficiently investigated which part of the outstanding advances are to be reimbursed by the debtors to the EDF (see paragraph 14); (b) the incompleteness of the provisions on doubtful debts, which do not reflect the real level of bad debts (see paragraph 15); (c) the unreliability of the balance of Stabex funds disclosed in a report joined to the financial statements (832 million euro) (see paragraph 16); the Court is of the opinion that the reports on financial implementation for the financial year 2004 and the financial statements at 31 December 2004 reliably reflect the revenue and expenditure relating to the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth EDFs for the financial year and their financial situation at the end of the year.
While progress has been achieved, further improvements need to be made in the following areas: (a) risk management (see paragraphs 20 to 22); (b) control framework (see paragraphs 23 to 33); (c) accountability for internal control of Delegations (see paragraphs 34 and 35); (d) Activity Report of the Director General of EuropeAid (see paragraph 36).
The Court found that the frequency and financial impact of the errors detected are not material (see paragraphs 37 to 41).
The financial statements and information supplied by the EIB are not covered by this Statement (see footnote 13). [2] Pursuant to Article 103(3) of the above-mentioned Financial Regulation; taken together with Article 1 of the same Regulation, this means that the Statement does not extend to the part of the ninth EDF resources that is managed by the EIB and for which it is responsible. --------------------------------------------------
