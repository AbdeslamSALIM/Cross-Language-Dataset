EEC TYPE-APPROVAL AND EEC INITIAL VERIFICATION EEC TYPE-APPROVAL AND EEC INITIAL VERIFICATION OF GAS VOLUME METERS SHALL BE CARRIED OUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COUNCIL DIRECTIVE OF 26 JULY 1971 ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO COMMON PROVISIONS FOR BOTH MEASURING INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS OF METROLOGICAL CONTROL . 9.1 .
EEC TYPE-APPROVAL 9.1.1 .
APPLICATIONS FOR EEC TYPE-APPROVAL FOR GAS METERS MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTS : - A DESCRIPTION OF THE METER GIVING THE TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND THE PRINCIPLE OF ITS OPERATION , - A PERSPECTIVE DRAWING OR PHOTOGRAPH OF THE METER , - A NOMENCLATURE OF PARTS WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE CONSTITUENT MATERIALS OF SUCH PARTS , - AN ASSEMBLY DRAWING WITH IDENTIFICATION OF THE COMPONENT PARTS LISTED IN THE NOMENCLATURE , - A DIMENSIONED DRAWING , - A PLAN SHOWING THE LOCATION OF VERIFICATION MARKS AND SEALS , - A PLAN OF THE INDICATING DEVICE , WITH ADJUSTMENT MECHANISMS , - A DIMENSIONED DRAWING OF METROLOGICALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS , - A PLAN OF THE DIAL PLATE AND OF THE INSCRIPTIONS ARRANGEMENTS , - WHERE APPROPRIATE , A PLAN OF THE ADDITIONAL DEVICES REFERRED TO IN SECTION I.B.3.1 , - WHERE APPROPRIATE , A TABLE SETTING OUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DRIVE SHAFTS ( SECTION I.B.3.2 ), - A LIST OF THE DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED , - A DECLARATION SPECIFYING THAT THE METERS MANUFACTURED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE TYPE MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFETY , PARTICULARLY THOSE CONCERNING THE MAXIMUM OPERATING PRESSURE AS INDICATED ON THE DATA PLATES . 9.1.2 .
THE FOLLOWING PARTICULARS SHALL APPEAR ON THE EEC TYPE-APPROVAL CERTIFICATE : - THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE PERSON TO WHOM THE EEC TYPE-APPROVAL CERTIFICATE IS ISSUED , - THE TYPE AND/OR COMMERCIAL DESIGNATION , - THE PRINCIPAL TECHNICAL AND METROLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS , SUCH AS THE MINIMUM FLOW , MAXIMUM OPERATING PRESSURE , NOMINAL INTERNAL DIAMETER OF THE CONNECTING PIECES AND , IN THE CASE OF VOLUMETRIC GAS METERS , THE NOMINAL VALUE OF THE CYCLIC VOLUME , - THE EEC TYPE-APPROVAL MARK , - THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE EEC TYPE-APPROVAL , - IN THE CASE OF METERS EQUIPPED WITH DRIVE SHAFTS : ( A ) THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SHAFT AS SET OUT IN SECTION I.B.3.2.1 ( WHERE THERE IS ONLY ONE DRIVE SHAFT ), ( B ) THE CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH SHAFT AND THE FORMULA GIVEN IN SECTION I.B.3.2.2 ( WHERE THERE ARE TWO OR MORE DRIVE SHAFTS ), - INFORMATION ON THE LOCATION OF EEC TYPE-APPROVAL MARKS , EEC INITIAL VERIFICATION MARKS AND SEALS ( WHERE APPROPRIATE , IN THE FORM OF PHOTOGRAPHS OR DRAWINGS ), - A LIST OF THE DOCUMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE EEC TYPE-APPROVAL CERTIFICATE , - ANY SPECIAL COMMENTS . 9.2 .
EEC INITIAL VERIFICATION 9.2.1 .
CHAPTER II 5.2 .
THE FITTING OF ADDITIONAL DEVICES MUST NOT CAUSE THE MECHANICAL PRESSURE ABSORPTION OF THE GAS METERS TO INCREASE BY MORE THAN 20 PA ( 0.2 MBAR ). 7.2.7 .
IN THE CASE OF METERS WITH SEVERAL DRIVE SHAFTS , THE TEST MUST BE CARRIED OUT ON THE SHAFT WHICH GIVES THE MOST UNFAVOURABLE RESULT .
FOR METERS OF THE SAME G SIZE , THE LOWEST TORQUE VALUE OBTAINED IN THE TESTS SHALL BE USED AS THE MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE TORQUE VALUE .
THE ERRORS MUST NOT ALL EXCEED HALF THE MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE ERROR IF THEY ARE ALL OF THE SAME SIGN . 5.2 .
IN THE CASE OF METERS WITH SEVERAL DRIVE SHAFTS , THE TEST MUST BE CARRIED OUT ON THE SHAFT WHICH GIVES THE MOST UNFAVOURABLE RESULT .
FOR METERS OF THE SAME G SIZE , THE LOWEST TORQUE VALUE OBTAINED IN THE TESTS SHALL BE USED AS THE MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE TORQUE VALUE .
WHERE A TYPE EMBRACES METERS OF VARIOUS G SIZES , THE TORQUE TEST NEED ONLY BE CARRIED OUT ON METERS OF THE SMALLEST G SIZE , PROVIDED THAT THE SAME TORQUE IS SPECIFIED FOR THE LARGER METERS AND THAT THE OUTPUT SHAFT OF THE LATTER HAS THE SAME OR A GREATER CONSTANT . 6.2.3.2 .
IN THE CASE OF METERS WITH SEVERAL VALUES FOR QMIN , ONLY THE TEST DESCRIBED IN SECTION III.6.2.3.1 FOR THE SMALLEST QMIN VALUE NEED BE CARRIED OUT .
