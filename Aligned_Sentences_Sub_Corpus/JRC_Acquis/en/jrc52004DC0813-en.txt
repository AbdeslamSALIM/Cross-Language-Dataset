BACKGROUND Following evidence of general government deficits above 3% of GDP in 2002, the Council in the first half of 2003 decided on a recommendation from the Commission that an excessive deficit existed in Germany and in France and adopted recommendations with a view to bringing this situation to an end by 2004.
The Commission brought a case before the Court of Justice challenging certain elements of the Council conclusions of 25 November 2003.
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE JUDGEMENT OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE FOR THE EXCESSIVE DEFICIT PROCEDURES CONCERNING GERMANY AND FRANCE The Court did not elaborate on the implications stemming from the annulment of the Council conclusions of 25 November for the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure.
Accordingly the Commission is called to assess whether the actions taken by each of the two Member States are consistent with a correction of the excessive deficit by 2005.
In contrast, real GDP growth in 2004 is likely to be higher than expected.
Nonetheless, it should be noted that in 2004 total expenditure remained constant in nominal terms compared with the previous year.
On 4 November, the federal government presented an additional savings package.
In addition, (iv) the general government deficit in 2005 will be lowered by a repayment of subsidies by the Landesbanken to the respective state budgets, following Commission decisions of 20 October 2004.
This measure is projected to reduce government expenditure by € 5.45bn in 2005 compared with the Commission Autumn forecast.
The German authorities have provided Eurostat with detailed information on the nature of the operation. (ii) Federal ministries are obliged to additional global expenditure savings of € 1bn (“ Globale Minderausgabe ”) in 2005.
This measure is projected to reduce government expenditure by € 1bn in 2005 compared with the Commission Autumn forecast. (iii) The federal government aims at granting no pay increases for the public service in 2005 (“Nullrunde”).
Respect of the deficit objective in 2004 was facilitated by a clear improvement in the macroeconomic situation relative to Budget projections: the French authorities currently expect real GDP growth at 2.5%, as against 1.7% in the draft Budget for 2004.
In its Autumn 2004 forecast, the Commission projected the 2004 deficit at 3.7% of GDP, under the assumption of real GDP increasing by 2.4%.
The improvement in the budgetary situation in 2005 would not be sufficient to bring the debt ratio on a declining path.
The Commission services autumn 2004 forecasts show a general government deficit at 3.7% of GDP in 2004 and 3.0% of GDP in 2005.
CONCLUSIONS In the light of the unique circumstances created by the Court judgement in relation to the excessive deficit procedure concerning Germany and France, in particular, the effects of the Council conclusions of 25 November 2003 before their annulment by the Court on 13 July 2004, the Commission reaches now the following conclusions on the situation of the two Member States concerned.
As regards Germany, on current information and on the basis of the measures detailed in the 2005 budgetary plans and the additional savings package announced by the Government on 4 November 2004, it appears that actions taken by the German authorities are broadly consistent with a correction of the excessive deficit by 2005.
As regards France, on current information and on the basis of the measures detailed in the 2005 budget, it appears that actions taken by the French authorities are broadly consistent with a correction of the excessive deficit by 2005.
Should failures in implementing the envisaged correction emerge at a later stage, the Commission would have to recommend to the Council to enhance the budgetary surveillance and to take the necessary action within the provisions of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact.
