For reasons of administrative practicability, the operative event for the exchange rate for the amount of that premium should fall at the beginning of the wine year. (4) Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 establishes a system for the restructuring and conversion of vineyards.
Taking into consideration the economic objectives of and the procedure for implementing the operations, the operative event for the exchange rate for those amounts should fall on the first day of the wine year concerned. (6) Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for a minimum price to be paid to the producers and for aid that the distiller may receive for distillation designed to support the potable alcohol sector.
Article 30 of that Regulation provides for a crisis distillation measure in an exceptional case of market disturbance caused by serious surpluses or problems of quality.
As the amount of that aid is linked to the distillation measures in question, it is appropriate to use the same principle when determining the operative event. (8) Articles 34 and 35 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 establish aids for specific uses.
The operative event for the exchange rate applicable to the permanent abandonment premium provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 shall be the first day of the wine year in which the application for the premium has been submitted. 2.
