In addition, the Court of Justice of the European Communities, in its judgement of 19 September 2002, established that, once the Community had legislated for the establishment of a common organisation of the market in a given agricultural sector, Member States are under an obligation to refrain from taking any measure which might undermines or create exceptions to it [6].
Aid towards the costs of participating in trade fairs, or of studies or consultancy services needed for the launch of a new or existing product on a new market does normally not constitute export aid. (7) In the light of the experience gained by the Commission, aid to undertakings in the fisheries sector not exceeding EUR 30000 per beneficiary over any three-year period may be deemed not to affect trade between Member States and/or not to distort or threaten to distort competition where the total amount of such aid granted to all undertakings in the fisheries sector over three years is below a ceiling of around 2,5 % of the annual fisheries output, and it therefore does not fall under Article 87(1) of the Treaty.
Alternatively, compliance with the ceilings may also be ensured by using a central register. (12) For reasons of clarity and as the ceiling for de minimis aid for the fisheries sector thus differs from the ceiling for de minimis aid to the agriculture sector, a specific regulation applicable only to the fisheries sector should be adopted and Regulation (EC) No 1860/2004 should be amended accordingly. (13) Having regard to the Commission's experience and in particular the frequency with which it is generally necessary to revise State aid policy, and in particular having regard to the period of application of Regulation (EC) No 69/2001 and Regulation (EC) No 1860/2004, it is appropriate that the period of application of this Regulation be limited until 31 December 2013.
Article 7 Entry into force and applicability This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Articles 1 to 5 shall expire on 31 December 2013.
