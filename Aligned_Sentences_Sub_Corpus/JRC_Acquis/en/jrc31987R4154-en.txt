ANNEX II DETERMINATION OF STARCHES OR DEXTRINS OR OTHER MODIFIED STARCHES CONTENT INTO GOODS OF SUBHEADINGS 3505 20 10 TO 3505 20 90 OF THE COMBINED NOMENCLATURE AND OF AMYLACEOUS SUBSTANCES CONTENT INTO GOODS OF SUBHEADINGS 3809 10 10 TO 3809 10 90 OF THE COMBINED NOMENCLATURE I.
Potassium hydroxide solution; 6.
Decolourizing charcoal; 7.
Fehling's solution; 8.
III.Method Into a 250 ml flask place a sample containing about 1 g of starch.
Add 100 ml of distilled water and 2 ml of hydrochloric acid.
Add distilled water to 200 ml and filter through a little decolourizing charcoal.Then pour the solution into a graduated burette and reduce 10 ml of Fehling's solution by the following method:Into a flat-bottomed flask of about 250 ml pour 10 ml of Fehling's solution (5 ml of solution A and 5 ml of solution B).
Shake until clear and add 40 ml of distilled water and a small quantity of quartz or pumice.Place the flask on a square asbestos plate with a round hole of about 6 cm diameter in the centre, the asbestos in turn resting on a piece of wire gauze.
IV.Preparation of Fehling's solutions Solution A: In a graduated flask dissolve 69,278 g of pure crystallized copper sulphate - Analytical Reagent (CuSO4 7 5 H2O) - free from iron in distilled water and bring the volume to 1 litre with distilled water.
