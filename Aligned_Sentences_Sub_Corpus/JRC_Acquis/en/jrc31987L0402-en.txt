The competent authority which has granted the original EEC component type-approval must grant the extension if the approved protection structure and the type(s) of tractor for which the extension is requested comply with the following conditions: -the mass of the unballasted tractor, as defined in section 1.4 of Annex III, does not exceed by more than 5 % the reference mass used in the test; -the method of attachment and the points of attachment to the tractor are identical, -any components such as mudguards and bonnet which may provide support for the protection structure have identical strength and are identically situated with respect to the protection structure, -the critical dimensions and the position of the seat and steering wheel relative to the protection structure, and the position relative to the protection structure of the points deemed rigid and taken into consideration for the purpose of verifying that the zone of clearance is protected, are such that the zone of clearance continues to be protected by the structure after the latter has undergone the deformation resulting from the various tests. 4.MARKINGS 4.1Every protection structure conforming to the approved type must bear the following markings: 4.1.1The trade mark or name; 4.1.2A component type-approval mark conforming to the model in Annex VII; 4.1.3Serial number of the protection structure; 4.1.4Make and type(s) of tractor(s) for which the protection structure is intended. 4.2All these particulars must appear on a small plate. 4.3These markings must be visible, legible and indelible.
Using any appropriate means, such as a jack or a hoist, tilt the part of the tractor which is rigidly connected to the axle that bears more than 50 % of the tractor's weight, while constantly measuring the angle of inclination.

If these tests are conducted in accordance with the static procedure, it must be possible to remove the wheels. 1.4.Tractor reference mass The reference mass mt, used in the formulae (see Annexes IV A and IV B) to calculate the height of the fall of the pendulum block, the loading energies and the crushing forces, must be at least that defined in section 2.4 of Annex I to Council Directive 74/150/EEC (i.e., excluding optional accessories but including coolant, oils, fuel, tools and driver) plus the protection structure and less 75 kilograms.
The length of the sides of the impact face must be 680 ± 20 mm (see Figure 4, of Annex V).
the metal strans must have an ultimate tensile strength of 1 770 MPa. 3.3.The central pivot of an articulated tractor must be supported and lashed down as appropriate for all tests.
The stiff flange must have a vertical face dimension of 150 mm.
The edges of the flange in contact with the protection structure must be curved with a maximum radius of 50 mm. 1.3.The pad must be capable of being adjusted to any angle in relation to the load direction, in order to be able to follow the angular variations of the structure's load-bearing surface as the structure deflects. 1.4.Direction of loading (deviation from horizontal and from vertical): -at start of test, under zero load : ± 2° -during test, under load: 10° above and 20° below the horizontal.
These variations must be kept to a minimum. 1.5.The deflection rate must be sufficiently slow (less than 5 mm/s) for the load at all moments to be considered as 'static'. 2.APPARATUS FOR MEASURING THE ENERGY ABSORBED BY THE STRUCTURE 2.1.The 'force versus deflection' curve must be plotted in order to determine the energy absorbed by the structure.
If the tractor moves, the entire test must be repeated, unless the system for measuring the deflections taken into account for plotting the 'force versus deflection' curve is connected to the tractor. 4.CRUSHING RIG 4.1.A rig as shown in Figure 8 of Annex V must be capable of exerting a downward force on a protection structure through a rigid beam approximately 250 mm wide connected to the load-applying mechanism by means of universal joints.
Suitable axle stand must be provided so that the tractor tyres do not bear crushing force. 5.OTHER MEASURING APPARATUS 5.1.A device such as that illustrated in Figure 9 of Annex V, for measuring the elastic deflection (the difference between the maximum momentary deflection and the permanent deflection). 5.2.A device for checking that the protection structure has not entered the zone of clearance and that the latter has remained within the structure's protection during the text (see section 3.2 of Annex IV B).
The point of impact is that part of the protection structure likely to hit the ground first in a rearward overturning accident, normally the upper edge.
The position of the centre of gravity of the block is one-sixth of the width of the top of the protection structure inwards from a vertical plane parallel to the median plane of the tractor touching the outside extremity of the top of the protection structure.
If the structure is curved or protruding at this point, wedges enabling the impact to be applied thereon must be added, without thereby reinforcing the structure. 1.1.2.The tractor must be lashed to the ground by means of four wire ropes, one at each end of both axles, arranged as indicated in Figure 5 of Annex V.
The rear lashings must in addition be so arranged that the point of convergence of the two wire ropes is located in the vertical plane in which the centre of gravity of the block travels.
If the structure is curved or protruding at this point, wedges enabling the impact to be applied thereon must be added, without thereby reinforcing the structure. 1.2.2.The tractor must be lashed to the ground by means of four wire ropes, one at each end of both axles, arranged as indicated in Figure 6 of Annex V.
With the wire ropes tensioned, the wedging beam must be placed behind and tight against the rear wheels and then fixed to the ground. 1.2.3.If the tractor is of the articulated type, the point of articulation must in addition be supported by a wooden block at least 100 mm square and firmly lashed to the ground. 1.2.4.The pendulum block must be pulled back so that the height of its centre of gravity above that at the point of impact is given by one of the following two formulae, to be chosen according to the reference mass of the assembly subjected to the tests: H =25 + 0,07 mt for assemblies with a reference mass of less than 2 000 kilograms, H =125 + 0,02 mt for assemblies with a reference mass of more than 2 000 kilograms.
The prop must then be placed as indicated in Figure 7 of Annex V, against the rim of the most heavily loaded wheel opposite to the point of impact, pushed firmly against the rim and then fixed at its base.
A force Fv = 20 mt must be applied.
It is then loaded with a force of 550 N at a point 50 mm in front of joint (A), and the two parts of the backrest board lightly pressed tangentially against the backrest. 2.3.1.4.If it is not possible to determine definite tangents to each area of the backrest (above and below the lumbar region) the following steps must be taken: 2.3.1.4.1.Where no definite tangent to the lower area is possible; the lower part of the backrest board is pressed against the backrest vertically; 2.3.1.4.2.Where no definite tangent to the upper area is possible; the joint (B) is fixed at a height of 230 mm above the lower surface of the seat pan board, the backrest board being perpendicular to the seat pan board.
However, the height of this rear structure over the seat reference point must be less than 500 mm (see Annex V, figure 2 f).
The load application point is that part of the roll-over protection structure likely to hit the ground first in a rearward overturning accident, normally the upper edge.
If the structure is curved or protruding at this point, wedges enabling the load to be applied thereon must be added, without thereby reinforcing the structure. 1.2.2.The assembly is lashed to the ground as described in section 3 of Annex III B. 1.2.3.The energy absorbed by the protection structure during the test must be at least Eil = 500 + 0,5 mt. 1.3.Loading from the side 1.3.1.The side loading is applied horizontally, in a vertical plane perpendicular to the tractor's median plane.
The load application point is that part of the roll-over protection structure likely to hit the ground first in a sideways overturning accident, normally the upper edge. 1.3.2.The assembly must be lashed to the ground as described in section 3 of Annex III B. 1.3.3.The energy absorbed by the protection structure during the test must be at least Eis = 1,75 mt Bb + B2B where Bb is the maximum external width of the protection structure and B is the minimum overall width of the tractor. 1.4.Crushing at the rear All provisions identical to those given in section 1.4 of Annex IV A. 1.5.Crushing at the front All provisions identical to those given in section 1.5 of Annex IV A. 1.6.Overload test (additional test) 1.6.1.An overload test must be carried out in all cases where the force decreases by more than 3 % during the last 5 % of the deflection reached when the energy required is absorbed by the structure (see Figure 10b). 1.6.2.The overload test involves the gradual increase of the horizontal load by increments of 5 % of the initial energy requirement up to a maximum of 20 % of energy added (see Figure 10c). 1.6.2.1.The overload test is satisfactory if, after each increase by 5, 10, or 15 % in the energy required, the force decreases by less than 3 % for a 5 % increment and remains more than 0,8 Fmax. 1.6.2.2.The overload test is satisfactory if, after the structure has absorbed 20 % of the added energy, the force exceeds 0,8 Fmax. 1.6.2.3.Additional cracks or tears and/or entry into or lack of protection of the zone of clearance due to elastic deflection are permitted during the overload test.
However, the height of this rear structure over the seat reference point must be less than 500 mm (see Annex V, Figure 2f).
