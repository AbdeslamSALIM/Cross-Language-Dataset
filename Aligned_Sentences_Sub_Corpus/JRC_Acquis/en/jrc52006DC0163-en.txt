Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social committee and the Committee of the Regions - Report regarding the outcome of the Review of the Scope of Universal Service in accordance with Article 15(2) of Directive 2002/22/EC {SEC(2006) 445} /* COM/2006/0163 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 7.4.2006 COM(2006) 163 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS Report regarding the outcome of the Review of the Scope of Universal Service in accordance with Article 15(2) of Directive 2002/22/EC{SEC(2006) 445} COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS Report regarding the outcome of the Review of the Scope of Universal Service in accordance with Article 15(2) of Directive 2002/22/EC(Text with EEA relevance) 1.
The Commission invited public comment on its analysis and preliminary conclusions, as well as on a number of longer-term questions designed to encourage a forward-looking policy discussion that can feed into the general review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications in 2006.
SUMMARY OF THE COMMISSION’S ANALYSIS AND INITIAL POSITON The Communication of May 2005 recalled the scope of universal service as currently defined[3], and the criteria for its review as set out in the Universal Service Directive[4].
The Communication also raised a number of long term issues: - Should universal service separate access from services and address only access to the communications infrastructure and not to the telephone service? - Should universal service address access at any location? - Is it still appropriate to include provisions on public payphones within the scope of universal service? - For how long will there be a need to keep directories and directory enquiry services within the scope of universal service? - Should special measures for users with disabilities be further harmonised at EU level in the context of universal service provision? - Should universal service funding from general taxation be an objective? 3.
These issues are outside the current review but the contributions will provide input for the policy debate in the context of the general regulatory review in 2006. 3.2.
Mobile Communications The Commission’s preliminary conclusion on mobile communications was that the conditions for including mobile communications within the scope of universal service were not fulfilled.
Some called for support for provision of broadband service in areas where commercial provision could not be relied upon for the time being.
However, the contributions received by the Commission on the longer-term issues provide a good basis to continue a forward-looking policy discussion on the universal service provision in the context of the general regulatory review of e Communications starting in 2006.
In accordance with Article 15(2) of the Universal Service Directive, the Commission presents this report on its review to the European Parliament and the Council. [1] COM (2005) 203 and SEC (2005) 660 respectively.

[3] The current scope consists of: (1) a connection to the public telephone network at a fixed location supporting voice and functional access to the Internet, and (2) access to publicly available telephone services. [4] See Recital 25 and Annex V.
The increase from 6.5% in mid-2004 (as reported in the Communication in May 2005) does not justify change in the Commission’s analysis.
