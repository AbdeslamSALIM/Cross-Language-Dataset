Furthermore, Article 14 of the Regulation establishing the current EUSF states that the Regulation shall be reviewed by 31 December 2006 at the latest. - General context The expression of solidarity with third countries in the face of disasters and emergency situations has existed for many years as part of the EU’s external actions.
Moreover, the rather vague qualitative criteria for such exceptional mobilisations of the EUSF are difficult to apply in practice and budgetary resources under this heading are limited to EUR 75 million per year only.
Mobilisation of the Fund under the main criterion ("major disaster") should become the rule rather than the exception. - Existing provisions in the area of the proposal The proposal is based on the current EUSF Regulation, which will be repealed with effect from the moment the proposed new Regulations applies, i.e. 1 January 2007.
The three influenza pandemics of the last century (in 1918, 1957 and 1968) killed millions of people and caused widespread disruption to the countries affected.
This political criterion should be used only in justified cases, assessed by the Commission, in particular in the event of serious public health emergencies or acts of terrorism.
Solidarity actions would in future be possible in the aftermath of other crisis situations such as industrial/technological disasters, public health threats and terrorist attacks.
Article 159 was used as a legal base for the current EUSF Regulation as regards Member States.
Article 159 therefore remains the appropriate legal base.
Member States acknowledged this in setting up the current European Union Solidarity Fund in 2002.
In order to be able to respond more quickly than under the current EUSF, provision is made for a mechanism by which under certain circumstances an advance of 5% of the estimated amount of eligible operations, but not exceeding EUR 5 million, could be paid upon request as "immediate solidarity".
The financial envelope foreseen for the Fund also follows the existing Solidarity Fund, with an annual amount of EUR 1 billion (current prices).
Where a major disaster has struck an eligible State, assistance should also be granted to an eligible neighbouring country affected by the same disaster. (7) Community aid should be complementary to the efforts of the States concerned and be used to cover a share of the public expenditure committed to dealing with the most essential emergency operations resulting from a major disaster. (8) In line with the principle of subsidiarity, Community aid should only be granted upon application of the affected State.
Therefore a deadline should be laid down for the use of the financial assistance awarded. (13) It may be desirable for a State which benefits from assistance to involve, in accordance with its specific constitutional, institutional, legal or financial context, regional or local authorities in the conclusion and application of the implementation agreements.
The beneficiary State should nevertheless remain responsible for the implementation of the assistance and for the management and control of the operations supported by Community financing in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[10], (hereinafter “the Financial Regulation”). (14) An operation funded under this Regulation should not receive financial assistance from other Community financial instruments.
Article 2 Major disasters For the purposes of this Regulation, a disaster shall be considered to be major where it results, in at least one eligible State, in direct damage, the amount of which is estimated as being in excess of EUR 1 billion in 2007 prices or in excess of 0,5 % of the gross national income of the State concerned.
Article 6 Advance funding 1.
The amount of the advance funding paid pursuant to the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall represent 5% of the of the total of the estimated costs referred to in Article 5(1)(b), but shall not exceed EUR 5 million.

Article 15 Financial shortfall 1.
Where, at the time when a proposal is submitted under Article 8, the remaining financial resources available for that year for the Fund are not sufficient to cover the amount of financial assistance considered necessary, the Commission may propose that the difference be financed from the financial appropriations available for the Fund for the following year. 2.
Article 16 Financial control by Community bodies The beneficiary State shall ensure that all financing decisions adopted pursuant to the implementation agreement provided for in Article 10, and all agreements and contracts resulting from those financing decisions provide for checks by the Commission, through the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), and for on-the-spot checks to be carried out by the Commission or the Court of Auditors, in accordance with the appropriate procedures.
