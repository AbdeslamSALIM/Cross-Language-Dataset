INTRODUCTION The Communication of March 2005 on “Better Regulation for Growth and Jobs”[1] identified simplification as one priority action for the EU.
A rolling programme anchored in stakeholders’ practical experience Annex 2 to this Communication sets out a rolling programme which forms part of the new strategy for simplification.
From Directives to Regulations As the Commission made clear in its Communication on Better Regulation for Growth and Jobs, the choice of the appropriate legal approach must be based on a careful analysis.
Simplification will be specifically addressed in the Commission's forthcoming Action Plan on e-government to be launched in 2006 under the i2010 initiative[25] with a focus on building on direct experiences and good practices that show tangible benefits in terms of efficiency and user satisfaction.
Before the end of the year, the Commission will adopt a multi-annual plan for the simplification of the CFP following consultations with public administrations and the industry. [12] The forthcoming proposal from the Commission on the multi-annual statistical programme for 2008-12 and, as a pilot exercise, in the 2007 annual work programme will include a number of initiatives to reduce the statistical requirements in areas of lower priority. [13] The Commission will present in 2006 a Green Paper on the development of labour law. [14] The “ Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21 st century ” (CARS 21) initiative consists of a High Level Group which reviews existing legislation with a view to improving the regulatory framework affecting the competitiveness of the automotive industry.
