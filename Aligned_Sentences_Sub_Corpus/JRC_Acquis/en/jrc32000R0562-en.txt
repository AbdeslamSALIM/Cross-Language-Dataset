(EEC) No 295/96(8), - the average market price by eligible category in a Member State or a region thereof shall be the average of the market prices for all the qualities referred to in the second indent, weighted by the proportion each represents of total slaughterings in that Member State or region; (b) decisions to open buying-in shall be made by category and Member State or region thereof on the basis of the two most recent weekly market prices recorded; (c) decisions to close buying-in shall be made by category and Member State or region thereof on the basis of the most recent weekly market prices recorded.
Article 4 Conditions for the eligibility of products 1.
In case of practical difficulties, Member States may derogate from the first subparagraph, provided that they tighten controls at the time of acceptance in accordance with Article 17(5); in that event, the intervention agencies shall, without prejudice to the veterinary requirements, be authorised to carry out boning of all or part of the beef bought in where the quantity bought in per week does not exceed 1000 tonnes per week, and of up to 50 % of any quantity bought in per week in excess of that amount.

Article 8 Storage of bone-in beef 1.
Section 2 Tendering and take-over Article 9 Opening and closure of invitations to tender 1.

The submission of tenders may be the subject of contracts on terms laid down by the intervention agencies and in accordance with their specifications. 3.
Tenders shall state: (a) the name and address of the tenderer; (b) the quantity tendered, expressed in tonnes, of the products of the categories specified in the notice of invitation to tender; (c) the price quoted in accordance with Article 18(3), expressed per 100 kg of products of quality R3 in euro rounded off to not more than two decimal places. 5.
Tenders shall be valid only if: (a) they relate to at least 10 tonnes; (b) they are accompanied by a written undertaking from the tenderer to comply with all the provisions relating to the invitation to tender concerned; and (c) proof is furnished that by the closing date for the submission of tenders the tenderer has lodged a tendering security as provided for in Article 12 in respect of the invitation to tender concerned. 6.

In the light of the tenders received in response to each invitation to tender and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999, a maximum buying-in price relating to quality R3 shall be fixed per category; where the particular circumstances so require, a different price may be set by Member State or region thereof to reflect the average market prices recorded. 2.
Article 14 Maximum buying-in price 1.
Tenders shall not be considered if the price quoted is higher than the average market price recorded by category in each Member State or region thereof, converted into quality R3 using the coefficients set out in Annex I, plus EUR 10 per 100 kg carcase weight. 2.
Without prejudice to paragraph 1, tenders shall be rejected if the price quoted is higher than the maximum price as referred to in Article 13 for the invitation to tender concerned. 3.
Where the buying-in price awarded to tenderers is higher than the average market price as referred to in paragraph 1, the price awarded shall be adjusted by multiplying it by the coefficient obtained by applying formula A in Annex IV.
However, that coefficient may not: (a) be greater than 1; (b) result in a reduction in the price awarded that is greater than the difference between that price and the average market price.
Should the Member State possess reliable data and have suitable means of verification, it may decide to calculate the coefficient for each tenderer using formula B in Annex IV. 4.

However, the quantity may be below 10 tonnes only if it is the final balance of the original offer or if the original offer has been scaled back below 10 tonnes.
Where no preliminary inspection is conducted immediately before loading at the slaughterhouse loading bay and prior to transport to the intervention centre, half carcases shall be identified as follows: (a) where they are simply marked, the markings must comply with Article 4(3)(c), and a document specifying the identification or slaughter number and the slaughter date relating to the half carcase shall be completed; (b) where they are labelled in addition, the labels must comply with Article 1(2), (3) and (4) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 344/91(14).
At the point of acceptance, each quarter shall be identified by a label complying with Article 1(2), (3) and (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 344/91.
Such inspections shall cover consignments of up to 20 tonnes of half carcases as laid down by the intervention agency.
Where more than 20 % of the total number of half carcases in any consignment inspected is rejected, the whole consignment shall be rejected in accordance with paragraph 6.
Before half carcases are transported to the intervention centre, they shall be cut into quarters in accordance with Annex III.
Each quarter shall be systematically weighed and identified by a label complying with Article 1(2), (3) and (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 344/91.
At the time of take-over, the total weight of the quarters in each consignment shall be recorded and the record kept by the intervention agency.
The requirements regarding identification, delivery and controls for the take-over of bone-in meat intended for boning in intervention centres which do not meet the requirements laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 5(2) shall include the following: (a) at the time of take-over as referred to in paragraph 1, forequarters and hindquarters for boning must be identified by the letters %quot%INT%quot% marked on both inner and outer sides in accordance with the same rules as those laid down in Article 4(3)(c) for marking the category and the slaughter number and the places where such markings are to be made; however, the letters %quot%INT%quot% shall be marked on the inner side of each quarter at the level of the third or fourth rib of forequarters and of the seventh or eighth rib of hindquarters; (b) the codfat must remain attached up to the time of take-over and must be removed before weighing; (c) the products delivered shall be sorted into consignments as defined under paragraph 1.
Where more than 20 % of a consignment presented is rejected, in terms of number of half carcases or quarters presented, the whole consignment shall be rejected and all the products shall be marked as such and may not be presented again for preliminary inspection or acceptance. 7.
If the quantity actually delivered and accepted is less than the quantity awarded, the security shall: (a) be released in full where the difference is not more than 5 % or 175 kg; (b) except in cases of force majeure, be forfeited: - in part, corresponding to the quantities not delivered or not accepted where the difference is not more than 15 %, - in full in other cases, pursuant to Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85.
Article 18 Price to be paid to successful tenderers 1.
Where qualities other than quality R3 are taken over, the price to be paid to successful tenderers shall be adjusted by applying the coefficient for the quality bought in as set out in Annex I. 4.
Article 19 Exchange rate The rate to be applied to the amount referred to in Article 14 and the price at which the award was made shall be the exchange rate applicable on the day of entry into force of the regulation fixing the maximum buying-in price and the quantities of beef to be bought in under the invitation to tender concerned.
