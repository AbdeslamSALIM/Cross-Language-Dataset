Experience has shown that precisely on account of the specific features of ports, sugar is frequently transported from some of these departments to the Community in vessels with a net registered tonnage of less than 20000 tonnes, whereas the Caribbean-United Kingdom freight element is established on the basis of vessels with a net registered tonnage of between 25000 tonnes and 30000 tonnes.
This flat-rate amount referred to in paragraph 1(b) shall be based on the Caribbean-United Kingdom freight element as established by the Freight Committee of the United Terminal Sugar Market Association of London and incorporated in the London daily price for sugar valid on the date on which the bill of lading for the sugar concerned is drawn up.
The competent French authorities may adjust the amount referred to in paragraph 1(b) on a flat-rate basis, where the actual transport costs borne by the producer exceed that amount because the vessels used have a net registered tonnage of less than 20000 tonnes.
The adjustment may be increased by no more than 25 % where the vessels used have a net registered tonnage of less than 7000 tonnes because of port conditions.
The aid referred to in Article 2 shall apply to the accepted arrival weight expressed as white sugar in accordance with the yield formula referred to in Article 4.
The aid referred to in Article 2 shall be paid on presentation, by the producer concerned, of: (a) any proof recognised by the Member State concerned that the sugar concerned has entered the European regions of the Community, and (b) the bill of lading, the analysis results and the definitive invoice.
The analyses shall be carried out at the unloading stage by lots of 250 tonnes on the whole cargo by a laboratory approved by the Member State into whose torritory the sugar has been introduced. 3.
A payment in advance may be made equal to 90 % of the amount determined on the basis of the weight as stated in the provisional invoice and expressed as white sugar on the basis of a flat-rate yield of 96 %.
The first advance on payment shall be calculated on the basis of the weight recorded in the silo at the port of loading by the competent French authorities or persons acting under their responsibility, and expressed as white sugar on the basis of a flat-rate yield of 96 %.
In the case of sugar as referred to in Article 1 which has been refined in a refinery in the European regions of the Community, aid shall be granted to the refineries concerned for every tenth of a percent of yield in excess of 92 %, of an amount equal to 0,0387 % of the intervention price for raw sugar for the marketing year during which refining takes place. 2.
Article 7 Regulation (EEC) No 2750/86 is hereby repealed.
Article 8 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
