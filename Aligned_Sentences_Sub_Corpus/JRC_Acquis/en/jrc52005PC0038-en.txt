The measures related to packing material and dunnage align Community measures with the FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) No 15 on “Guidelines for regulating wood packaging material in international trade” which was adopted in March 2002.
A draft Commission Directive which would amend Directive 2000/29/EC and, in particular, would postpone the implementation of the measures for packing material and dunnage from 1 March 2005 to 1 March 2006, received no opinion from the Standing Committee on Plant Health on 21 January 2005: 94 votes for (BE, EE, EL, CY, LT, LU, NL, PL, SI, FI), 215 against ( DK, DE, ES, FR, IE, IT, LV, HU, MT, AT, PT, SK, SE, UK) and 12 abstentions (CZ).

They shall apply those provisions from 1 March 2005.
Article 3 This Directive shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
