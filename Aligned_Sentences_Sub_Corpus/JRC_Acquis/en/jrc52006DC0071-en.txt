Efforts are ongoing to ensure a swift adoption of the Directive in early 2006 on the basis of a common position negotiated between the Council and the European Parliament.
The European Economic and Social Committee adopted an opinion supportive of the proposal on 28 September 2005[8].
Further to a Commission proposal, the Council, the Parliament and the Commission adopted a Joint Statement on " The European Consensus on Development "[11] in November 2005 which identified gender equality as one of the five key principles of the development policy.
As a result, the employment rate gap was further reduced to 15.2 points in 2004, down from 18.1 points in 1999.
More than four in ten employed women work in public administration, education, health or social activities, compared to less than two in ten men.
