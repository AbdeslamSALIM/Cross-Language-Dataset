CHAPTER II Technical specifications for interoperability Article 5 1.
When each TSI is adopted, the date of its entry into force shall be laid down in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 21 (2). 6.
Article 7 A Member State need not apply certain TSIs, including those relating to rolling stock, in the following cases and circumstances: (a) in the case of a project for a new line or upgrading an existing line for high speed which is at an advanced stage of development when the TSIs in question are published.
CHAPTER III Interoperability constituents Article 8 Member States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that interoperability constituents: - are placed on the market only if they enable interoperability to be achieved within the trans-European high-speed rail system while at the same time meeting the essential requirements; - are used in their area of use as intended and are suitably installed and maintained.
Article 9 Member States may not, in their territory and on grounds of this Directive, prohibit, restrict or hinder the placing on the market of interoperability constituents for use on the trans-European high-speed rail system if they comply with the Directive.
Where the decision referred to in paragraph 1 is justified by the existence of a gap in the European specifications, the procedure defined in Article 11 shall apply. 3.
Article 15 Without prejudice to Article 19, Member States may not, in their territory and on grounds of this Directive, prohibit, restrict or hinder the construction, placing in service and operation of structural subsystems constituting the trans-European high-speed rail system which satisfy the essential requirements.
Article 17 If it emerges that the TSIs do not fully meet the essential requirements, the Committee referred to in Article 21 may be consulted at the request of a Member State or on the initiative of the Commission.
CHAPTER V Notified bodies Article 20 1.
Member States shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of the bodies responsible for carrying out the procedure for the assessment of conformity or suitability for use referred to in Article 13 and the checking procedure referred to in Article 18, indicating each body's area of responsibility.
Member States shall apply the criteria provided for in Annex VII for the assessment of the bodies to be notified.
CHAPTER VI Committee Article 21 1.
The opinion shall be delivered by the majority laid down in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty in the case of decisions which the Council is required to adopt on a proposal from the Commission.
Should it prove necessary, the Committee may set up working parties to aid it in carrying out its tasks, in particular with a view to coordinating the notified bodies. 5.
Article 24 Every two years the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and the Council on the progress made towards achieving interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system.
Article 25 This Directive shall enter into force on the 21st day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
