A number of measures that seek to regulate the market by reducing future production should accordingly be adopted. (2) The special premium for male bovine animals provided for in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999(4) is one of the main support instruments for beef/veal production.
Moreover, to encourage producers to convert store cattle animals to steers, which are kept for a longer period on grassland, a second payment of the premium should be possible for steers for which a first payment has been made as bulls. (3) The derogation enabling Member States to change or waive the headage limit of 90 animals per holding and age bracket which determines the granting of the special premium may produce an increase in the number of animals eligible for the premium on large production units.
To do this, the effect - in terms of reducing production - achieved by including heifers among the animals eligible for the suckler-cow premium provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 should be reinforced by setting a minimum percentage for heifers for a limited period, and increasing the maximum percentage of such animals.
Taking account of the reduced herd size due to foot-and-mouth disease, this obligation would not be applicable in the United Kingdom in 2002 and limited in 2003.
This involves corresponding adjustments to the separate national ceiling for heifers referred to in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.
In order to take account of the reduction in the number of available suckler cows because of foot-and-mouth disease, the United Kingdom should be exempted from this measure in 2002. (5) The number of animals qualifying for the special premium and the suckler-cow premium is currently limited by the application of a stocking density of two livestock units (LU) per hectare pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.
In the United Kingdom, the obligation to keep a minimum number of heifers is not applicable in 2002 and is limited to 5 % in 2003.
If, in 2002 and 2003, Member States decide to apply the possibility provided for in the first subparagraph, the suckler-cow premium shall be granted to any producer keeping a number of heifers equal to at least 5 % and at most 20 % of the total number of animals for which the premium is requested.
It shall apply from 1 January 2002.
