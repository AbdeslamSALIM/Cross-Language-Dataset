For the Commission Stavros Dimas Member of the Commission [1] OJ L 237, 21.9.2000, p. 1. [2] OJ L 200, 30.7.1999, p. 1.
Directive as last amended by Council Directive 2004/66/EC (OJ L 168, 1.5.2004, p. 35). -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX FRAMEWORK The aims of the criteria These criteria aim in particular at promoting those products that: - are of reduced harm to the water and soil during use, and - lead to reduced CO2 emissions.
The critical concentration for the aquatic toxicity of each main component shall be at least 100 mg/l.
For hydraulic oils the critical concentration for the aquatic toxicity shall be at least 100 mg/l.
Greases may be evaluated by providing data for the preparation and the main components only if the thickener shows ultimate biodegradation (see criterion 3) or inherent biodegradation according to: - a biodegradation &gt; 70 % in the OECD 302 C test for inherent biodegradation or equivalent test methods, or - a biodegradation &gt; 20 % but &lt; 60 % after 28 days in the OECD 301 tests based on oxygen depletion or carbon dioxide generation, or - biodegradation &gt; 60 % in ISO 14593 (CO2 headspace test).
Table 1 summarises the requirements for the different product subgroups according to criterion 2.1.
Table 1 Aquatic toxicity requirements for the different product subgroups — Data requirements for the preparation and main components Criterion 2.1 | Hydraulic fluids | Greases [3] | Chainsaw oils, concrete release agents and other total loss lubricants | Two-stroke oils | Aquatic toxicity for the fully formulated product in all three of the acute toxicity tests OECD 201, 202 and 203 | ≥ 100 mg/l | ≥ 1000 mg/l | ≥ 1000 mg/l | ≥ 1000 mg/l | Aquatic toxicity for each individual main component in OECD 201 and 202 | ≥ 100 mg/l | ≥ 100 mg/l | ≥ 100 mg/l | ≥ 100 mg/l | Assessment and verification of criterion 2.1 Reports shall be submitted to the competent body including the data on the aquatic toxicity of the preparation and all main components by making use of either existing material from registrations or new tests, allowing compliance to be demonstrated with the requirements set out in table 1.
Table 2 Aquatic toxicity requirements for the different product subgroups — Data requirements for each constituent substance Criterion 2.2 | Cumulative mass concentration of substances present in | Aquatic toxicity | Hydraulic fluids | Greases | Chainsaw oils, concrete release agents and other total loss lubricants | Two-stroke oils | 10 mg/l &lt; Acute toxicity [4] ≤ 100 mg/l or 1 mg/l &lt; NOEC ≤ 10 mg/l | ≤ 20 | ≤ 25 | ≤ 5 | ≤ 25 | 1 mg/l &lt; Acute toxicity [4] ≤ 10 mg/l or 0,1 mg/l &lt; NOEC ≤ 1 mg/l | ≤ 5 | ≤ 1 | ≤ 0,5 | ≤ 1 | Acute toxicity [4] &lt; 1 mg/l or NOEC ≤ 0,1 mg/l | ≤ 1 | ≤ 0,1 | ≤ 0,1 | ≤ 0,1 | Assessment and verification of criterion 2.2 Reports shall be submitted to the competent body including the data on the aquatic toxicity of each constituent substance by making use of either existing material from registrations or new tests, demonstrating compliance with the requirements set out in Table 2.
The preparation of a water accommodated fraction shall follow the recommendations set out according to one of the following guidelines; ECETOC Technical Report No 20 (1986), Annex III to OECD 1992 301 or the ISO Guidance document ISO 10634, or ASTM D6081-98 (Standard practice for Aquatic Toxicity Testing for Lubricants: Sample Preparation and Results Interpretation or equivalent methods).
The acute aquatic toxicity study on algae and daphnia (OECD 201 and 202) does not need to be conducted when: - the substance is unlikely to cross biological membranes MM &gt; 800 or molecular diameter &gt; 1,5 nm (&gt; 15 Å), - or the substance is highly insoluble in water (water solubility &lt; 10 μg/l), as such substances are not regarded as toxic for algae and daphnia in the aquatic system.
Similarly, the acute aquatic toxicity study on daphnia (OECD 202) does not need to be considered when a long-term toxicity study on Daphnia’s according to OECD 211 or equivalent one is available.
If chronic toxicity data are available (results of OECD 210 and 211 tests or equivalent methods), these may be used instead of acute aquatic toxicity data.
Table 3 Requirements for biodegradability and bioaccumulative potential | Cumulative mass concentration of substances is | Biodegradation | Hydraulic fluids | Greases | Chainsaw oils, concrete release agents and other total loss lubricants | Two-stroke oils | Non-biodegradable [5] | ≤ 5 | ≤ 10 | ≤ 5 | ≤ 10 | Inherently aerobically biodegradable | ≤ 5 | ≤ 20 | ≤ 5 | ≤ 20 | Ultimately aerobically biodegradable | ≥ 90 | ≥ 75 | ≥ 90 | ≥ 75 | Assessment and verification of criterion 3 Conformity shall be demonstrated by providing the following information: - reports including the data on the biodegradability of each constituent substance if this is not adequately shown on the safety data sheets provided for each substance, - reports including the data on the bioaccumulative potential of each constituent substance: - for non-biodegradable substances, and - for toxic and very toxic substances that are readily biodegradable (for classification purposes).
A substance is considered inherently biodegradable if it shows: - a biodegradation &gt; 70 % in the OECD 302 C test for inherent biodegradation or equivalent test method, or - a biodegradation &gt; 20 % but &lt; 60 % after 28 days in the OECD 301 tests based on oxygen depletion or carbon dioxide generation, or - biodegradation ≥ 60 % in ISO 14593 (CO2 headspace test).
A substance whose primary function is thickening shall be considered inherently aerobically biodegradable if it shows a biodegradation higher than 20 % in the OECD 302 C for inherent biodegradation or equivalent test methods.
A substance does not bioaccumulate if its MM &gt; 800 or has a molecular diameter &gt; 1,5 nm (&gt; 15 Å).
A substance with MM &lt; 800 or molecular diameter &lt; 1,5 nm (&lt; 15 Å) does not bioaccumulate if: - the octanol-water partition coefficient log Kow &lt; 3 or &gt; 7, or - the measured BCF is ≤ 100.
Test methods The tests to be applied for the determination of ready biodegradability are the OECD 301 A-F series, or ISO and ASTM equivalents or the BOD5/(ThOD or COD) ratio.
The BOD5/(ThOD or COD) ratio can only be used if no data based on the OECD 301 or any other equivalent test methods are available.
The log octanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow) shall be assessed according to OECD 107, 117 or the draft 123 or any other equivalent test method.
the substance has a high surface activity or does not dissolve in water or in octanol), a calculated value for log Kow as well as details of the calculation method shall be provided.
The following calculation methods are allowed for the log Kow: CLOGP for a log Kow between 0 and 9, LOGKOW (KOWWIN) for a log Kow between – 4 and 8, AUTOLOGP for a log Kow greater than 5 as laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 [7], which is supported by a technical guidance document (TGD). 4.
Renewable raw materials The formulated product shall have a carbon content derived from renewable raw materials that shall be: - ≥ 50 % (m/m) for hydraulic oils, - ≥ 45 % (m/m) for greases, - ≥ 70 % (m/m) for chainsaw oils, concrete release agents and other total loss lubricants, - ≥ 50 % (m/m) for two-stroke oils.
Chainsaw oils shall at least meet the technical performance criteria laid down in the RAL UZ 48 of the Blue Angel.
