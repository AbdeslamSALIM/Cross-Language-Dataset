That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation. (3) The application concerns authorisation of a new use of the preparation Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC Sc 47) (Biosaf SC 47) as a feed additive for lambs for fattening, to be classified in the additive category %quot%zootechnical additives%quot%. (4) The method of analysis included in the application for authorisation in accordance with Article 7(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 concerns the determination of the active substance of the feed additive in feed.
The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
