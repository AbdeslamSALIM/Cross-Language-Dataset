Article 3 Member States shall take all measures to ensure that the substances and materials listed as extraction solvents in the Annex satisfy the following purity criteria: (a) they shall not contain a toxicologically dangerous amount of any element or substance; (b) subject to any exceptions deriving from the specific purity criteria referred to in (c), they shall not contain more than 1 mg/kg of arsenic or more than 1 mg/kg of lead; (c) they shall satisfy the specific purity criteria determined in accordance with Article 4.
Article 4 The following shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 6: (a) the methods of analysis necessary to verify compliance with the general and specific purity criteria referred to in Article 3; (b) the procedure for taking samples and the methods for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the extraction solvents cited in the Annex used in foodstuffs or food ingredients; (c) if necessary, the specific purity criteria for the extraction solvents listed in the Annex, and in particular maximum permitted limits of mercury and cadmium in the extraction solvents; these criteria are to be adopted within three years from the date of adoption of this Directive.
Where a Member State, as a result of new information or of a reassessment of existing information made since the Directive was adopted, has detailed grounds for establishing that the use in foodstuffs of any substance listed in the Annex or the level of one or more of the components referred to in Article 3 contained in such substances might endanger human health although it complies with the conditions laid down in this Directive, that Member State may temporarily suspend or restrict application of the provisions in question in its territory.
Article 9 Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive within three years of its adoption, so as to authorize from that date trade in and use of extraction solvents complying with the provisions of this Directive and to prohibit trade in and use of extraction solvents which do not comply therewith.
