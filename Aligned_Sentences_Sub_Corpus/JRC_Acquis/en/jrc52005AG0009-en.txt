Common Position (EC) No 9/2005 of 29 November 2004 adopted by the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-using products and amending Council Directive 92/42/EEC and Directives 96/57/EC and 2000/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council Common Position (EC) No 9/2005 adopted by the Council on 29 November 2004 with a view to adopting Directive 2005/…/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of … establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-using products and amending Council Directive 92/42/EEC and Directives 96/57/EC and 2000/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2005/C 38E/04) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1], After consulting the Committee of the Regions, Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2], Whereas: (1) The disparities between the laws or administrative measures adopted by the Member States in relation to the ecodesign of energy using products can create barriers to trade and distort competition in the Community and may thus have a direct impact on the establishment and functioning of the internal market.
Climate change is one of the priorities of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme, laid down by Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 [3].
The rigorous enforcement of implementing measures is necessary to reduce the environmental impact of regulated EuPs and to ensure fair competition. (19) When preparing implementing measures and its working plan the Commission should consult Member States' representatives as well as interested parties concerned with the product group, such as industry, including SMEs and craft industry, trade unions, traders, retailers, importers, environmental protection groups and consumer organisations. (20) When preparing implementing measures, the Commission should also take due account of existing national environmental legislation, in particular concerning toxic substances, which Member States have indicated that they consider should be preserved, without reducing the existing and justified levels of protection in the Member States. (21) Regard should be given to the modules and rules intended for use in technical harmonisation Directives set out in Council Decision 93/465/EEC of 22 July 1993 concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures and the rules for the affixing and use of the CE conformity marking [4]. (22) Surveillance authorities should exchange information on the measures envisaged within the scope of this Directive with a view to improving surveillance of the market.
This Directive establishes a framework for the setting of Community ecodesign requirements for energy using products with the aim of ensuring the free movement of those products within the internal market. 2.
Article 3 Placing on the market and/or putting into service 1.
Article 4 Marking and declaration of conformity 1.
Before an EuP covered by implementing measures is placed on the market and/or put into service, a CE conformity marking shall be affixed and a declaration of conformity issued whereby the manufacturer or its authorised representative ensures and declares that the EuP complies with all relevant provisions of the applicable implementing measure. 2.
The CE conformity marking consists of the initials 'CE' as shown in Annex III. 3.
The declaration of conformity shall contain the elements specified in Annex VI and shall refer to the appropriate implementing measure. 4.
Article 5 Free movement 1.
Member States shall not prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market and/or putting into service, within their territories, on grounds of ecodesign requirements relating to those ecodesign parameters referred to in Annex I, part 1 which are covered by the applicable implementing measure, of an EuP that complies with all the relevant provisions of the applicable implementing measure and bears the CE marking in accordance with Article 4. 2.
Member States shall not prohibit, restrict or impede the placing on the market and/or putting into service, within their territories, of an EuP bearing the CE marking in accordance with Article 4 on grounds of ecodesign requirements relating to those ecodesign parameters referred to in Annex I, Part 1 for which the applicable implementing measure provides that no ecodesign requirement is necessary. 3.
Article 6 Safeguard clause 1.
Where a Member State ascertains that an EuP bearing the CE marking referred to in Article 4 and used in accordance with its intended use does not comply with all the relevant provisions of the applicable implementing measure, the manufacturer or its authorised representative shall be obliged to make the EuP comply with the provisions of the applicable implementing measure and/or with the CE marking and to end the infringement under conditions imposed by the Member State.
The Member State shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States of any decision taken pursuant to paragraph 1, indicating the reasons therefor, and, in particular, whether non-compliance is due to: (a) failure to satisfy the requirements of the applicable implementing measure; (b) incorrect application of harmonised standards as referred to in Article 9(2); (c) shortcomings in harmonised standards as referred to in Article 9(2). 4.
Article 7 Conformity assessment 1.
If an EuP covered by implementing measures is designed by an organisation having a management system which includes the product design function and which is implemented in accordance with harmonised standards the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, that management system shall be presumed to comply with the corresponding requirements of Annex V. 3.
After placing an EuP covered by implementing measures on the market or putting it into service, the manufacturer or its authorised representative shall keep relevant documents relating to the conformity assessment performed and declarations of conformity issued available for inspection by Member States for a period of 10 years after the last of that EuP has been manufactured.
Documents relating to the conformity assessment and declaration of conformity referred to in Article 4 shall be drawn up in one of the official languages of the Community.
Article 8 Presumption of conformity 1.
Member States shall regard an EuP bearing the CE marking referred to in Article 4 as conforming to the relevant provisions of the applicable implementing measure. 2.
Article 9 Harmonised standards 1.
Where a Member State or the Commission considers that harmonised standards the application of which is presumed to satisfy specific provisions of an applicable implementing measure do not entirely satisfy those provisions the Member State concerned or the Commission shall inform the Standing Committee set up under Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC to that effect, giving the reasons.
Article 10 Requirements for components and sub-assemblies Implementing measures may require manufacturers or their authorised representatives placing components and sub-assemblies on the market and/or putting them into service to provide the manufacturer of an EuP covered by implementing measures with relevant information on the material composition and the consumption of energy, materials and/or resources of the components or sub-assemblies.
Article 11 Administrative cooperation and exchange of information 1.

Implementing measures shall lay down ecodesign requirements in accordance with Annex I and/or Annex II.
Implementing measures shall include the elements listed in Annex VII. 9.

AMENDMENTS ACCEPTED 6.
AMENDMENTS NOT INTEGRATED 7.
The Council considered that amendments 1 to 4, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19, 21, 22, 27, 29 to 34, 36 to 46, 49 to 58, 60 to 62, 64, 67 to 68, 70 to 72, 74 to 76 and 79 to 81 would either undermine the harmonisation aim of the Directive (e.g. 1, 2 and 61), would be inconsistent with the objective of the Directive or its legal base (e.g. 3, 4, 29, 31, 37, 50 to 52, 64, 67, 68 ), and decided therefore not to integrate them in its common position.
