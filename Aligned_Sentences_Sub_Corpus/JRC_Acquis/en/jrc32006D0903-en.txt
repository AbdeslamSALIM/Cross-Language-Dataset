(Case COMP/F/C.38.620 — Hydrogen Peroxide and perborate) (notified under document number C(2006) 1766) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 3 May 2006 relating to a proceeding under Article 81 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement against Akzo Nobel NV, Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding AB, EKA Chemicals AB, Degussa AG, Edison SpA, FMC Corporation, FMC Foret S.A., Kemira OYJ, L'Air Liquide SA, Chemoxal SA, Snia SpA, Caffaro Srl, Solvay SA/NV, Solvay Solexis SpA, Total SA, Elf Aquitaine SA and Arkema SA. (Case COMP/F/C.38.620 — Hydrogen Peroxide and perborate) (notified under document number C(2006) 1766) (only the English, French and Italian versions are authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/903/EC) 1.
Addressees (1) The decision is addressed to the following undertakings: - Akzo Nobel NV (%quot%Akzo%quot%) - Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding AB (%quot%ANCH%quot%) - EKA Chemicals AB (%quot%EKA%quot%) - Degussa AG (%quot%Degussa%quot%) - Edison SpA (%quot%Edison%quot%) - FMC Corporation (%quot%FMC%quot%) - FMC Foret S.A. (%quot%Foret%quot%) - Kemira OYJ (%quot%Kemira%quot%) - L'Air Liquide SA (%quot%Air Liquide%quot%) - Chemoxal SA (%quot%Chemoxal%quot%) - Snia SpA (%quot%Snia%quot%) - Caffaro Srl (%quot%Caffaro%quot%) - Solvay SA/NV (%quot%Solvay%quot%) - Solvay Solexis SpA (%quot%Solexis%quot%) - Total SA (%quot%Total%quot%) - Elf Aquitaine SA (%quot%Elf Aquitaine%quot%) - Arkema SA (%quot%Atofina%quot%). (2) The addressees of the Decision participated in a single and continuous infringement of Article 81 of the Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement regarding hydrogen peroxide (%quot%HP%quot%) and its downstream product sodium perborate (%quot%PBS%quot%), covering the whole EEA territory (%quot%the infringement%quot%).
The period of infringement retained in the decision is from 31 January 1994 to 31 December 2000.
It is a clear, colourless liquid which is available commercially as an aqueous solution in concentrations mainly ranging from 30 % to 70 %.
The other players were Atofina, Kemira, Degussa and Foret.
There have been no new market entrants in recent years. (6) PBS: the undertakings active in the EEA during the whole of, or part of, the period of the infringement were: Degussa, Foret, Solvay, Caffaro (which however suspended its production in 1999), Atofina (which ceased production in 1999), Air Liquide (stopped in 1994) and Ausimont. 1.4.
Functioning of the cartel (11) The period of infringement retained in the decision is 31 January 1994 until 31 December 2000. (12) The collusive practices can be categorised as follows: it concerned exchange of market related information (including prices and sales volumes), market sharing, limitation/control of production and sources of supply as well as price fixing for HP and PBS.
Degussa provided the Commission with evidence that allowed carrying out inspections in March 2003 at the premises of three companies (the investigation against other companies was first conducted by requests for information). (14) After the inspections five other companies submitted an application for reduction of fines.
Three of them were granted a reduction of fines, in accordance with point 23 and 26 of the Leniency Notice, namely EKA, Atofina and Solvay.
Basic Amount (15) The basic amount of the fine is determined according to the gravity and duration of the infringement. 2.1.1.
Gravity (16) In assessing the gravity of the infringement, the Commission takes account of its nature, its actual impact on the market, where this can be measured, and the size of the relevant geographic market. (17) Taking into account the nature of the infringement committed, the fact that it must have had an impact and the fact that it covered the whole of the EEA, where the HP and PBS market taken together had a total value of around EUR 470 million in 1999, the last full year of the infringement, the Commission considers that the undertakings to which this Decision is addressed have committed a very serious infringement of Article 81 of the Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement. 2.1.2.
Degussa, with a market share of [10-20] %, is placed in a second category.
Consequently, given the circumstances of the case, a reduction of 25 % is applied to the starting amount of the fine calculated for Caffaro. 2.1.3.
Akzo and Degussa, with a turnover each of around 10 % of that of Total are still very large undertakings, with a turnover well exceeding EUR 10,000 million.
In view of the fact that Solvay had a turnover of EUR 8,560 million, the Commission considers it appropriate to multiply the fine for Solvay by a factor of 1,5.
In view of the fact that Edison had a turnover of EUR 6,650 million, the Commission considers it appropriate to multiply the fine for this undertaking by a factor of 1,25.
Increase for duration (22) Degussa, Solvay and Kemira participated in the infringement from 31 January 1994 to 31 December 2000, a period of six years and eleven months.
EKA participated in the infringement from 31 January 1994 until 31 December 1999, a period of five years and eleven months, while Atofina and Ausimont participated in the infringement from 12 May 1995 until 31 December 2000, a period of five years and seven months.
Foret participated in the infringement from 29 May 1997 until 13 December 1999, a period of two years and seven months.
Caffaro participated in the infringement from 29 May 1997 until 31 December 1998, a period of one year and seven months.
Attenuating circumstances (24) In the case of Caffaro, it is appropriate to reduce its fine due to its passive and minor role in the infringement, as compared to the other participants in the cartel, by 50 %. 2.4.
Application of the 10 % turnover limit (25) Article 23(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 provides that the fine imposed on each undertaking is not to exceed 10 % of its turnover.
As regards the 10 % ceiling, if %quot%several addressees constitute the %quot%undertaking%quot%, that is the economic entity responsible for the infringement penalised, […] at the date when the decision is adopted, […] the ceiling can be calculated on the basis of the overall turnover of that undertaking, that is to say, of all its constituent parts taken together.
By contrast, if that economic unit has subsequently broken up, each addressee of the decision is entitled to have the ceiling in question applied individually to it%quot% [5]. (26) The world-wide annual turnover achieved by Solexis in 2005 was EUR 256190307.
The fine imposed on Solexis must therefore not exceed EUR 25,619 million. 2.5.
Application of the 2002 Leniency Notice (27) Degussa, EKA, Atofina, Solvay, Solexis and Kemira submitted applications under the Leniency Notice.
Hence, Degussa qualifies for a full immunity from the fine that would otherwise have been imposed on it. 2.5.2.
Point 23 (b), first indent (reduction of 30-50 %) (29) EKA was the second undertaking to approach the Commission under the Leniency Notice, on 29 March 2003, and the first undertaking to meet the requirements of point 21 thereof, as it provided the Commission with evidence which represents significant added value with respect to the evidence already in the Commission's possession at the time of its submission. (30) EKA terminated its involvement in the infringement no later than the time at which it submitted the evidence and its involvement has remained terminated.
The Commission granted EKA a 40 % reduction of the fine. (31) EKA's evidence enabled the Commission to trace the existence of the cartel back to 31 January 1994.
EKA's evidence for the period of the infringement before 14 October 1997 related to facts previously unknown to the Commission which had a direct bearing on the duration of the suspected cartel.
In accordance with point 23 of the Leniency Notice, the Commission did not take these elements into account for the purposes of setting the amount of the fine to be imposed on EKA 2.5.3.
Point 23 (b), second indent (reduction of 20-30 %) (32) Atofina, (now Arkema), was the second undertaking to meet the requirements of point 21 of the Leniency Notice, as it provided the Commission with evidence which represents significant added value with respect to the evidence already in the Commission's possession at the time of its submission and, to the Commission's knowledge, Atofina terminated its involvement in the infringement no later than the time at which it submitted the evidence.
On 4 April 2003, also soon after its premises had been inspected under Article 14 of Regulation No 17, on 25 March 2003, Solvay submitted an application under the Leniency Notice.
The application by Atofina, made on 3 April 2003 at 15:50hrs enclosed thirteen documents which, according to Solvay, were illegible and/or unintelligible without a transcript or other form of explanation, so that the Commission was unable to make use of any of these documents until a full explanation was provided, on 26 May 2003, in any case after Solvay's leniency application was made. (35) Solvay submits that a decisive factor in determining whether an application for leniency qualifies for a reduction under the Leniency Notice is the objective quality of the information submitted in terms of the extent to which it is useful to the Commission.
Therefore the Commission rejects Solvay's argument. (37) Solvay was granted a 10 % reduction of the fine that would otherwise have been imposed on it. 2.5.5.
Other applications under the Leniency Notice (38) Solvay Solexis and Kemira also filed applications under section B of the Leniency Notice but no reduction was granted, due to lack of significant added value in their applications. 3.
A separate fine is accordingly addressed to Atofina alone for this amount. [5] See the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 15 June 2005 in joined cases T-71/03, T-74/03, T-87/03 and T-91/03 Tokai Carbon Co.
