Nevertheless, it should be possible, where climatic reasons lead to production in the areas covered by the cultivation contract of a larger quantity of potatoes or of potatoes with a higher starch content than was originally foreseen, for an undertaking producing potato starch to accept such potatoes provided that it pays the minimum price. (4) Potatoes having a starch content of less than 13 % cannot be considered potatoes intended for the manufacture of potato starch.
Potatoes with a starch content of less than 13 % should not be accepted by starch-producing undertakings.
The Commission should, where climatic reasons lead to a lower starch content, and at the request of a Member State, be able to authorise the acceptance of potatoes having a starch content lower than 13 % under certain conditions. (5) It is necessary to define acceptable methods for determining the underwater weight of potatoes and to provide a table showing the corresponding starch content and aid payable. (6) Inspection measures should be introduced to ensure that only starch produced in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation gives rise to payment of the premium.

If, contrary to Article 5(3), the starch that can be manufactured from consignments accepted with a starch content below 13 %: - exceeds 1 % of the processing undertaking's subquota, no premium shall be granted for the excess quantity; furthermore, the premium granted for the subquota shall be reduced by ten times the excess percentage recorded; - exceeds 11 % of the processing undertaking's subquota; no premium shall be granted for the marketing year in question; furthermore, the processing undertaking shall be ineligible for the premium for the following marketing year. 6.
