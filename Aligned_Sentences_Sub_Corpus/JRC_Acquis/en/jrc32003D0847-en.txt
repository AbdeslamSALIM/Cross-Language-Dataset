However 2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7 and TMA-2 are hallucinogenic drugs that carry potential risks common to other hallucinogenic substances, such as 2C-B, DOB, TMA and DOM, already classified in Schedules I or II to the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
Therefore a risk of acute or chronic toxicity cannot be excluded. (3) 2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7 and TMA-2 are not currently listed in any of the Schedules to the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. (4) At present, 2C-I and 2C-T-2 are controlled under the national drugs legislation in five Member States; 2C-T-7 and TMA-2 are controlled in four Member States. (5) 2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7 and TMA-2 have no therapeutic value or industrial use. (6) 2C-I has been identified in four Member States; 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 have been identified in six Member States; TMA-2 has been identified in five Member States.
Laboratories involving the production of 2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7 and TMA-2 have been seized in three Member States.
