However, despite women's major advance into the labour market over time, the aim to increase the number of women in employment to 60 %, set at the Lisbon Summit in 2000, has not been achieved.
The Committee of the Regions 1.3.3 notes, however, that adequate steps have not been taken to implement the gender mainstreaming strategy, which involves integrating the gender equality dimension into all macro-economic policies; 1.3.4 stresses that the EC's Court of Justice has considered, for example in its judgment in the case C-285/98 Tanja Kreil ( 11 January 2000), that the right not to suffer discrimination on the grounds of sex is a fundamental right in Community law and that any derogation from it must be interpreted strictly.
Women who have "chosen" to work part-time (over 40 % in Denmark and Sweden, over 60 % in France, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) usually do so because of family responsibilities; 1.3.7 emphasises that striking an adequate balance between job flexibility and security is essential for achieving the fundamental goals of the Lisbon strategy, which advocates more flexible organisation of work.
