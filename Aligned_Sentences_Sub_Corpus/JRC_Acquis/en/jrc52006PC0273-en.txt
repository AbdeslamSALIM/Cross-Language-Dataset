General context for the proposal on multi-annual eradication, control and monitoring programmes for animal diseases and zoonoses Article 24 of Council Decision 90/424/EEC establishes that the Member States may receive financial contribution from the Community for their programmes for eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases.
Article 29 provides for the financing of monitoring and control programmes for zoonoses under the same procedure laid down in Article 24.
The Community approval and financial support to the above referred programmes is currently granted following comitology procedure annually to programmes submitted by the Member States by 31 May every year.
General context for the proposal on integrated computerized (IT) veterinary system TRACES Currently, Article 37 of Council Decision 90/424/EEC provides for Community financial assistance for computerization of veterinary import procedures.
