However, the protocol currently in force was thoroughly evaluated in August 2004 with the assistance of a consortium of independent consultants, with a view to the possible launch of negotiations for a new protocol.
The 2004 study could be updated with data for 2005. 6.2.1 Ex-ante evaluation Here is some background information on the value of the current protocol (2002-05) drawn from the 2004 study: (Study of the "Sao Tomé e Principe" agreement: Ex-post evaluation of the current protocol to the fisheries agreement between the European Community and the Republic of São Tomé e Príncipe, and analysis of the impact of the future protocol on sustainability, including ex-ante evaluation” by Oceanci Developpement and Poseidon Aquatic Resource Management Ltd.
It is mainly a tuna agreement (63 vessels) with an experimental fishing opportunity targeting crab for three vessels of less than 250 GRT (for the period from 1 June 2002 to 31 May 2003 only).
Use of the EC/São Tomé and Príncipe fisheries agreement (number of vessels) Vessel Type: | Fishing opportunities offered | Use in 2002/03 | Use in 2003/04 | Use in 2004/05[12] | Average use | Tuna seiners | 36 vessels | 72% | 78% | 67% | 72% | Pole-and-line tuna boats | 2 vessels | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | Surface longliners | 25 vessels | 64% | 68% | 40% | 57% | Since tunas are highly migratory species, catches in a particular zone can vary considerably from one fishing year to another.
It should be noted that the authorities of São Tomé and Príncipe have undertaken to sending a detailed implementation report as provided for in the protocol.
The indicators listed in point 5.3 will be used to carry out an a ex-post evaluation. 7.
