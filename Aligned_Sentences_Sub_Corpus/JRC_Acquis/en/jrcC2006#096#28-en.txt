Pleas in law and main arguments The applicant appeals against the Commission's decision in Case COMP/F/38.354 â€” Industrial sacks (C(2005) 4634 final; hereinafter %quot%the contested decision%quot%) by which a fine of EUR 17.85 million is imposed on the applicant for participating in anticompetitive conduct in the market for industrial sacks in Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands contrary to Article 81 EC.
Moreover, according to the applicant, the Commission did not take account of the 10 % rule in Regulation No 1/2003, [1] and the Commission should have granted the applicant leniency to a greater degree than was the case in the contested decision.
Finally, the applicant claims that the Commission has failed to apply the principles of legal certainty and proportionality. [1] Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty (OJ L 1, 4.1.2003, p. 1). --------------------------------------------------
