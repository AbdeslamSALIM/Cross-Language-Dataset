When the results of the surveys referred to in Article 2 during more than two consecutive years have confirmed the presence of the organism in a part of their territory, Member States shall define zones, covering that part of their territory where the organism was found ("infested zones"). 2.
Member States shall either apply the provisions of Article 4 or, in case there is evidence that the organism can no longer be eradicated, organise programmes on a yearly basis in the infested zones and their vicinity to limit the spread of the organism from the infested zones into areas that are free from the organism ("containment programmes").
