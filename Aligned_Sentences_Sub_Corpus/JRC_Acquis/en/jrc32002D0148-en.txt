During these consultations, which took place in Brussels on 11 January 2002, the European Union reiterated its serious concern as regards politically motivated violence, freedom of the media, independence of the judiciary, end of illegal farm occupations and free and fair elections, and considered that significant progress remains to be achieved in these areas.
The European Union was confident that free and fair presidential elections in March 2002 would put the country on the path of democracy, social peace and economic recovery in Zimbabwe.
