Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the: - "Proposal for a Council Directive on a specific procedure for admitting third-country nationals for purposes of scientific research" - "Proposal for a Council Recommendation to facilitate the admission of third-country nationals to carry out scientific research in the European Community" - "Proposal for a Council Recommendation to facilitate the issue by the Member States of uniform short-stay visas for researchers from third countries travelling within the European Community for the purpose of carrying out scientific research" (COM(2004) 178 final â&#x20AC;&#x201C; 2004/0061 (CNS)) (2005/C 120/12) On 7 April 2004, the Council decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 262 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned proposals.
At its 412th plenary session on 27- 28 October 2004 (meeting of 27 October 2004), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 181 votes to one with three abstentions. 1.
To achieve this aim it has been calculated that the European Union will need 700000 additional researchers.
The following interlocking measures have been identified: - to make science attractive to young people at school; - to improve the career prospects for researchers in the European Union; and - to extend the opportunities for training and mobility. 1.3 Although the target of 700000 extra researchers will mainly include EU nationals, it is recognised that in order to meet this target researchers from third countries will be needed.
It should be expanded to include public or private organisations that allocate grants for research as well as those organisations, that conduct research. 3.4.2 The EESC is pleased to see the reiteration of the Barcelona European Council commitment to increase investment in research and technological development to 3 % of GDP by 2010, with two-thirds of that investment coming from the private sector. 3.4.3 The Committee strongly recommends that the Commission consults the private sector on this proposal in general and specifically on the task being recommended that the research establishment produces the hosting agreement that triggers the admission of a researcher to a Member State. 3.5 A broad interpretation of the concept of researcher, adapted to the needs of the European Union 3.5.1 The EESC agrees with the Commission's recommendation, not to restrict the procedure to persons who already have the status of researcher in their country of origin. 3.5.2 However the EESC does not concur with the restriction with regards to the purpose of admission.
The EESC believes this is a start in addressing a very serious issue. 3.9.3 One of the topics from the previous Commission's Communication on researchers â&#x20AC;&#x201C;COM(2003) 436 final - that the Committee wants to highlight is gender.
