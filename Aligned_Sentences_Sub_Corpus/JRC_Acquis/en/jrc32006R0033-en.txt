Existing measures (1) By Regulation (EC) No 119/97 [2] (the original Regulation), the Council imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of certain ring-binder mechanisms (RBMs or the product concerned) originating in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (China), equal to the difference between the minimum import price of EUR 325 per 1000 pieces for mechanisms with 17 and 23 rings and the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, ranging from 32,5 % to 39,4 % for mechanisms other than with 17 and 23 rings. (2) Following an investigation pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, the Council amended and increased the above duties for mechanisms other than with 17 or 23 rings through Regulation (EC) No 2100/2000 [3] (the anti-absorption investigation).
The amended definitive anti-dumping duties ranged from 51,2 % to 78,8 %. (3) By Council Regulation (EC) No 1208/2004 [4], the Council extended the measures imposed by the original Regulation to imports of RBMs consigned from the socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam). (4) Following an expiry review, the duties were re-imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2074/2004 [5]. 2.
Request (5) On 28 February 2005, the Commission received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain RBMs originating in China.
Initiation (8) Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed for the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation, the Commission initiated an investigation according to Regulation (EC) No 559/2005 [6] (the initiating Regulation).
Pursuant to Articles 13(3), 14(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission, by the initiating Regulation, also directed the customs authorities to register imports of certain RBMs consigned from Laos, whether declared as originating in Laos or not, as from 14 April 2005. 4.
Investigation period (12) The investigation period covered the period from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004 (the IP).
General considerations/degree of cooperation (13) As mentioned above in recitals 10 and 11, no producers/exporters of RBMs in China or in Laos cooperated in the investigation nor did any Community importers submit information relevant for the investigation.
Accordingly, findings in respect of RBMs consigned from Laos to the Community had to be made on the basis of the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation. 2.
As from the same time, imports from Laos started from nil in the preceding periods to 100 tonnes in the first semester 2004 and to 392 tonnes in the second semester 2004; it is clear therefore that imports from Laos replaced, at least partially imports from Vietnam and China.
The reported imports from Laos thus confirm a pattern of trade that commenced from 1999, since before the extension of the measures to Vietnam, there were no imports from Laos into the Community.
Country | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 (IP) 1st semester | 2004 (IP) 2nd semester | China | 302 | 302 | 330 | 212 | 142 | Vietnam | 0 | 1105 | 1778 | 353 | 0 | Laos | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100 | 392 | 4.
Evidence of dumping in relation to the normal values previously established for like or similar products (24) As explained in recital 13, given the absence of cooperation, in order to determine whether evidence of dumping could be found with respect to the exports of the product concerned to the Community from Laos during the IP, Eurostat data at CN level were used pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation as the basis for establishing export prices to the EU. (25) In accordance with Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, these export prices were compared with the normal value previously established, in this case the normal value established in the most recent expiry review.
The duties extended by paragraph 1 of this Article shall be collected on imports registered in accordance with Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96. 3.
The request must be sent to the following address: European Commission Directorate-General for Trade Directorate B Office: J-79 05/17 B-1049 Brussels Fax (32-2) 295 65 05 Telex COMEU B 21877 . 2.
Article 3 Customs authorities are hereby directed to discontinue the registration of imports, established in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 559/2005.
Article 4 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
