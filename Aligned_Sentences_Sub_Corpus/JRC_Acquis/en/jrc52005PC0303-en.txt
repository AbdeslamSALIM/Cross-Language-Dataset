environment and trade (Articles 175 and 133 of the EC Treaty), is correct and cannot accept a single legal base as proposed by Council (Article 175 of the EC Treaty).
This would take care of the concerns expressed by some Member States in terms of risks for procedural duplication and allow the Commission to maintain its proposal. 3.2 Detailed comments 3.2.1 Parliamentary amendments accepted by the Commission in full , in part or in principle and incorporated in the common position Amendments 8 and 108 regarding the recitals have been incorporated.
Incorporated in principle.

Amendments 82 and 46 concerning guidelines for the application of the provision on so-called ‘sham recovery’ have been accepted in part.
Incorporated in Article 58(1)(b).
Amendment 75, 76 and 77 concerning the annexes have been accepted.
Amendments 17 and 18 propose to make non-hazardous waste as listed in Annex III subject to prior written notification.
In addition, a specific provision regarding shipments of waste consisting, containing or contaminated with the chemicals listed in Annex A, B and C of the Stockholm Convention of 22 May 2001 on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has not been considered necessary to maintain in the proposal due to the adoption of a specific regulation on this subject (Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC, Official Journal L 158 , 30/04/2004, p.7-49).
Amendments 21, 26-27, 34, 41, 85rev.
In addition, amendment 116 would create a barrier to the internal market in waste for recovery.
Amendment 49 regarding certain criteria in relation to recovery cannot be accepted.
However, a provision concerning the adoption of guidelines for the application of the provision on so-called ‘sham recovery’ has been incorporated in Article 58(1)(b).
Amendments 40 and 50 delete the possibility that the competent authorities concerned can agree with the notifier not to require a new notification in the case where problems in relation to objections have not been solved within a certain time-limit.
Amendment 51 is considered not to be needed (cf.
Amendment 105 deleting the obligation for the person who arranges the shipment to provide a copy of the contract upon request by the competent authority concerned in relation to shipments of non-hazardous waste for recovery cannot be accepted.
Amendments 68, 71-73, 78 and 106 are all related to changes to the specific entries of the lists of waste as annexed to the proposal and cannot be accepted.
However, since the provisions of Titles IV, V and VI on exports out of, imports into and transit through the Community to and from third countries, are also rules on international trade, the legal basis as regards those specific provisions is Article 133 of the EC Treaty.
Amendments 42, 47 and 48 concerning objections to shipments of waste for recovery based on national standards or national obligations cannot be accepted by the Commission.
The Commission considers that such a provision would create barriers in the European waste recycling and recovery market while not improving the environmental standards of waste management in the EU.
The Commission recalls that it proposed solutions to the potential problem of standards dumping in its Communication COM(2003) 301 final “ Towards a thematic strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste ”, focusing on the development of European waste management standards.
Amendment 31 states that the competent authorities of destination and transit shall signify their written consent by issuing a written decision to the other competent authorities and to the notifier.
The Commission cannot support the common position in this regard and considers it preferable to bring forward its review of the relationship between this Regulation and Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption, so that the results of this review are made public before the entry into force of the Regulation.
STATEMENT BY THE COMMISSION The Commission notes that there is unanimity in the Council to replace the joint legal base proposed by the Commission, namely Articles 133 and 175(1) of the Treaty, by a single legal basis including only Article 175(1) of the Treaty.
The Commission considers that this provision will create barriers in the European waste recycling and recovery market while not improving the environmental standards of waste management in the EU.
