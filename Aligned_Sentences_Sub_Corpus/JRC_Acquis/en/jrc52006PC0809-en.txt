The inclusion of these new Articles is entirely in line with the recommendations made by the CARS 21 High Level Group.
Given the complexity of type-approval systems already in place since 1996 and the legal aspects concerned, the discussions within the Council managed to preserve the delicate balance between the requirements of road safety, environmental protection and the needs of the industry.
Article 38 (‘Notification and appointment of technical services) has been completely rewritten.
The new timetable takes account of the fact that the deadline for transposition of the directive by the Member States has been extended from 12 to 18 months.
The Commission fully endorses these changes. 4.
CONCLUSION With its initial proposal of 14 July 2003, the Commission proposes to extend the benefits of type-approval to all vehicles, including commercial vehicles, so as to complete the internal market in the automobile sector.
Several articles have also been introduced in response to the recommendations made in the CARS 21 report with a view to simplifying future Community legislation.
