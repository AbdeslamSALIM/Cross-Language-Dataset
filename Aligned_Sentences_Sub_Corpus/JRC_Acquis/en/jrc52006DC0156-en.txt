Third report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of Directives 93/96, 90/364, 90/365 on the right of residence for students, economically inactive and retired Union citizens {SEC(2006) 424} /* COM/2006/0156 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 5.4.2006 COM(2006) 156 final T HIRD REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT on the application of Directives 93/96, 90/364, 90/365 on the right of residence for students, economically inactive and retired Union citizens {SEC(2006) 424} THIRD REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT on the application of Directives 93/96, 90/364, 90/365 on the right of residence for students, economically inactive and retired Union citizens (Text with EEA relevance) INTRODUCTION WITH THIS REPORT, THE COMMISSION IS DISCHARGING ITS OBLIGATION UNDER ARTICLE 4 OF DIRECTIVES 90/364[1] on the right of residence and 90/365[2] on the right of residence for employed and self-employed persons who have ceased their occupational activity and Article 5 of Directive 93/96[3] on the right of residence for students , to draw up a report every three years on the application of the Directives and to submit it to the European Parliament and the Council.
Judgment of 7.9.2004 in case C-456/02 Michel Trojani v Centre public d'aide sociale de Bruxelles The Court recalled that the right to reside in the territory of the Member States is not unconditional but conferred subject to the limitations and conditions laid down by the Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect.
The Court confirmed that it remains open to the host Member State to take the view that a person who has recourse to social assistance no longer fulfils the conditions of the right of residence.
Judgment of 19.10.2004 in case C-200/02 Kunqian Catherine Zhu and Man Lavette Chen v Secretary of State for the Home Department The Court held that the situation of a Union citizen who was born in a Member State other than that of his or her nationality and has not made use of the right to freedom of movement cannot, for that reason alone, be assimilated to a purely internal situation, thereby depriving that national of the benefit in the host Member State of the provisions of Community law on freedom of movement.
It admitted that a refusal to allow the parent, whether a Union citizen or a national of a non-member country, who is the carer of a child to whom Article 18 EC and Directive 90/364 grant a right of residence, to reside with that child in the host Member State would deprive the child's right of residence of any useful effect and concluded that enjoyment by a young child of a right of residence necessarily implies that the child is entitled to be accompanied by the person who is his or her primary carer.
Judgment of 15.3.2005 in case C-209/03 The Queen (on the application of Dany Bidar) v London Borough of Ealing and Secretary of State for Education and Skills The Court reversed the position it had held previously in the Lair (39/86) and Brown (197/86) judgments and concluded that assistance to students to cover their maintenance costs falls within the scope of application of the Treaty for the purposes of Article 12 EC.
However, Directive 93/96 does not preclude a national of a Member State who by virtue of Article 18 EC and Directive 90/364 is lawfully resident in the territory of another Member State where he intends to start or pursue higher education from relying during that residence on the principle of equal treatment.
It concluded that Article 12 EC must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which excludes a national of another Member State from the right to assistance covering students’ maintenance costs even if that national is lawfully resident and has received a substantial part of his secondary education in the host Member State and has consequently established a genuine link with the society of that State.
Judgment of 14.4.2005 in case C-157/03 Commission v Spain An action against Spain was brought before the Court on 7.3.2003 by the Commission.
Infringement procedures for non-compliance or incorrect application of the Directives The most relevant cases concerned the following questions: Residence visa Following the judgment of 14.4.2005 ( see point 2 ), the Commission decided to send a letter of formal notice on the basis of Article 228 EC to Spain on 13.12.2005.
The Commission decided to send a reasoned opinion to Italy on 13.12.2005 with regard to the Decree of the President of the Republic of 18.1.2002 n° 54 on the grounds that this text is contrary to Directive 93/96 in that it provides that students must provide proof that they dispose of sufficient resources and contrary to the three Directives in that it requires family members to present proof of sufficient res ources separate to that presented by the Union citizen.
The Commission also decided on 30.3.2004 to close a case of incorrect application of national transposition measures by the Netherlands, in which a German student was refused a residence card because he had not provided proof of a bank account.
An action against Belgium was brought before the Court of Justice on 30.9.2003 ( case-408/03 ) by the Commission for failure to fulfil its obligations under Article 18 EC and Directive 90/364 by making the right of residence of Union citizens subject to the condition that they have sufficient personal resources.
Consequences of recourse to social assistance As confirmed by the Court of Justice in the Grzelczyck and the Trojani cases, Member States may consider that a beneficiary of Directives 90/364 or 93/96 who has recourse to social assistance no longer fulfils the conditions of his right of residence and may take measures, within the limits imposed by Community law, either to withdraw his residence permit or not to renew it.
In its abovementioned reasoned opinion to the Netherlands dated 3.4.2003, the Commission considered that the Dutch legislation which provides that if a Union citizen has recourse to social assistance his right of residence is refused or automatically suspended is contrary to Directive 90/364.
A formal notice was sent to France on 18.10.2004 concerning the requirements imposed by the French authorities on Union citizens and their family members, on the basis of a Circular of 6.12.2000, to present a series of documents proving their civil status and their domicile in order to obtain a residence card and concerning a complaint regarding similar requirements in order to change the address in the residence card.
A formal notice was sent to Spain on 21.12.2005 concerning its requirement to a retired British pensioner who spends more than three months per year in Spain but does not wish to transfer his residence definitely to Spain, to submit a form 121 provided under Regulation 1408/71 in order to obtain a residence card in Spain.
Discriminatory penalties for failure to obtain or renew a residence card An action against Spain was brought before the Court of Justice on 7.3.2003 by the Commission ( case C-108/03 ) for failure to fulfil its obligations, inter alia, under Articles 39, 43 and 49 EC inasmuch as non-Spanish Union citizens in Spain are treated, as regards the degree of fault and scale of fines for infringement of provisions relating to residence permits, disproportionately different from Spanish nationals who commit the comparable infringement of the obligation to obtain or renew national identity documents.
Permanent residence card – discrimination on grounds of nationality An action against France was brought before the Court of Justice by the Commission on 17.6.2003 ( case C-258/03 ) on the grounds that by making the grant of a permanent residence permit to nationals of the other Member States under Decree 94-221 of 11.3.1994 subject to a condition of reciprocity, France had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 12 of the EC Treaty.
In order to monitor transposition by Member States and to assist them with this task, the Commission has convened two meetings with Member States’ experts in June 2005 and January 2006.
The Commission is closely monitoring progress in the transposition of this Directive and will give the utmost priority to ensuring that it is correctly transposed into national law.
