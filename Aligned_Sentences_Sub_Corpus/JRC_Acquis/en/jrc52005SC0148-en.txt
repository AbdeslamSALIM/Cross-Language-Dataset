Recommendation for a Council opinion in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated stability programme of Finland, 2004-2008 /* SEC/2005/0148 final */ Brussels, 2.2.2005 SEC(2005)148 final Recommendation for a COUNCIL OPINION in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated stability programme of Finland, 2004-2008 (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Council Regulation (EC) No. 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies[1] stipulates that participating Member States, that is, those which have adopted the single currency, had to submit stability programmes to the Council and the Commission by 1 March 1999.
In accordance with Article 5 of this Regulation, the Council had to examine each stability programme based on assessments prepared by the Commission and the Committee set up by Article 114 of the Treaty (the Economic and Financial Committee).
Updates were presented every following year.
The update of the stability programme covers the period from 2004 to 2008.
According to this policy, balance in central government finances, in national account terms, should be restored at the end of the electoral period in 2007.
To help to achieve this target the government in May 2003 approved annual spending limits for the period 2004-2007.
As there are no announced plans to decrease spending in 2005-2007, the central government deficit would be higher between 2005 and 2007 than cited in the programme, unless revenue-raising measures are introduced, thereby also lowering the surplus in general government finances.
The government estimates that the wage-agreement-cum-tax-cuts will lower the general government surplus by 0.3 percentage points to about 1.9% of GDP in 2007.
The current programme projects the debt ratio to fall from an estimated 44.6% of GDP in 2004 to about 41% by 2008.
In particular, the multi-annual spending limits introduced in 2003 seem to have worked well in the first year of operation, namely 2004, when the final budgetary spending was below the ceiling and also expenditure in the 2005 budget is within the ceilings.
The macro-economic scenario underlying the programme envisages real GDP growth to ease from 3.2% in 2004 to 2.4% on average over the rest of the programme period.
The aim is to have central government finances back in balance in 2007.
The government estimates that the wage-agreement-cum-tax-cuts will lower the general government surplus by 0.3 percentage points to about 1.9% of GDP in 2007.
In particular, the multi-annual spending limits introduced in 2003 seem to have worked well in the first year of operation, namely 2004, when the final budgetary spending was below the ceilings and also expenditure as proposed in the 2005 budget is within the ceilings.
