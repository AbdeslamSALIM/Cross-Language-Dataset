The first came into force on 3 January 2002 (“stage I”); the second series of reduced limits is due to come into operation on 3 January 2006 (“stage II”).
This proposal pursues the following objectives: - To allow certain types of equipment (for which clear evidence has been provided that the stage II limits are not presently technically feasible) to be placed on the market and/or put into service in the European Community from 3 January 2006; - To provide the Commission with sufficient time to fulfil its obligations at Articles 16 and 20 of the Noise Directive; - To allow for the incorporation of the Report foreseen at Article 20(3) into the Report foreseen at Article 20(1) of the Noise Directive.
With respect to the majority of the machines to which such limits are to be applied this has been the case. - General context Technical issues emerging from the application of the Noise Directive to some types of equipment During the sixth meeting of the Noise Steering Group on 16 May 2003, the Commission gave to the Working Group on Outdoor Equipment, often referred to as "WG7", the task to advise on the technical aspects of the comments and requests presented by industry and Member States in respect of the application of the Noise Directive.
As a first step towards providing a Report to cover the provisions foreseen at Article 20(1) of the Noise Directive, the position paper issued by the WG7 on 8 July 2004 covered the technical feasibility of the stage II limits amongst other aspects that may, in the future, be the subject of further review.
In particular, substantive concerns were raised with respect to: - Dozers (steel tracked); - Loaders (steel tracked &gt; 55 kW); - Compacting screed paver finishers; - Vibratory plates; - Vibratory rammers; - Walk behind vibratory rollers; - Industrial lift trucks &gt;10 t.
The Commission’s obligations under Articles 16 and 20 of the Noise Directive Pursuant to Article 16 of the Noise Directive, the manufacturer of equipment, or his authorised representative in the Community, is required to send copies of the EC declarations of conformity containing information on sound power levels to both the Commission and the Member State where he resides or where he places such equipment on the market or puts it into service.
In light of the above, it is therefore proposed that both Reports be prepared as a single document by 3 January 2007 and that Article 20 be amended accordingly. - Existing provisions in the area of the proposal European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/14/EC of 8 May 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the noise emission in the environment by equipment for use outdoors. - Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union The Noise Directive was developed following the Fifth Environmental Action Programme attached to the Council Resolution of 1 February 1993[2] and the Green Paper on Future Noise Policy (COM(96) 540 final), which identified noise in the environment as one of the main local environmental problems in Europe.
Consultation of interested parties and impact assessment - Consultation of interested parties Consultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents Consultation of the Noise Committee in accordance with Article 19(c) of the Directive and of the Noise Experts Working Group at the meetings held on 21 March 2005.
Member States and stakeholders were consulted on the draft amendment text in May 2005 and given two weeks for submitting written observations.
In respect of hand-held internal combustion engine concrete breakers and picks the WG7 recommended to include such breakers and picks into the category “not smaller than 30 kg” as this amendment would bring the Noise Directive in line with Directive 84/537/EEC that it superseded and replaced.
This is considered impossible as such breakers and picks are intended to be “hand-held”, so less than 30 kg.
This categorisation has been further refined following discussion with stakeholders to the effect that only such equipment of mass between 15 kg and 30 kg are to be included.
Stakeholders therefore support the need for the reference to “industrial lift trucks &gt; 10 t” in the list of equipment for which a delay in the application of the stage II is proposed to be expanded to “ combustion-engine driven counterbalanced lift trucks ” in order to include rough terrain lift trucks, thus in effect all lift trucks currently falling under Article 12.
This proposal therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. - Proportionality principle The proposed amendment does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives set out above.
This proposal therefore complies with the proportionality principle as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. - Choice of instruments Proposed instruments: directive.
In view of the fact that the obligations contained at Article 20(1) are more prescriptive than those at Article 20(3) and in order to avoid duplication of effort it is appropriate to include these types of equipment in the general report provided for in Article 20(1) of the Directive.
Pel for power generators: prime power according to ISO 8528-1:1993, clause 13.3.2 (2) The figures for stage II are indicative only for the following types of equipment: - Walk- behind vibrating rollers; - Vibratory plates (&gt;3kW); - Vibratory rammers; - Dozers (steel tracked); - Loaders (steel tracked &gt; 55 kW); - Combustion-engine driven counterbalanced lift trucks; - Compacting screed paver-finishers; - Hand-held internal combustion-engine concrete-breakers and picks (15&lt;m&lt;30) - Lawnmowers, lawn trimmers/lawn-edge trimmers.
They shall apply those provisions from 3 January 2006.
