Proposal for a Council Decision on a Community Position regarding Decision No. [2/2006] of the Community/Switzerland Air Transport Committee established under the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on Air Transport, amending the Annex to the Agreement /* COM/2006/0218 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 19.5.2006 COM(2006) 218 final Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION on a Community Position regarding Decision No. [2/2006] of the Community/Switzerland Air Transport Committee established under the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on Air Transport, amending the Annex to the Agreement (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM On 1 June 2002 the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on Air Transport entered into force.
Article 21 of the Agreement establishes a Community/Switzerland Air Transport Committee which is responsible for the administration and proper implementation of the Agreement.
On the occasion of the fourth meeting of the Community/Switzerland Air Transport Committee, which was held in Brussels on 25 November 2005, it was agreed in principle that Switzerland would incorporate the acquis related to the Single European Sky (SES): Regulation 549/2004 (the framework Regulation), Regulation 550/2004 (the service provision Regulation), Regulation 551/2004 (the airspace Regulation) and Regulation 552/2004 (the interoperability Regulation), as well as the first SES implementing acts: Regulation 2096/2005 (common requirements for the provision of air navigation services) and Regulation 2150/2005 (flexible use of airspace).
Because Switzerland accepted that in relation to the SES legislation Community Institutions will have direct authority on its territory (“single pillar approach”) Switzerland can participate, as an observer, in the Single European Sky Committee, through a unilateral Declaration of the Council (similar to the unilateral declaration adopted by the Council in 2002 on Swiss participation in the aviation competition Committee and in the market access Committee, and similar to the solution found for the EASA Regulation 1592/2002).
COMMUNITY POSITION ON DECISION 2/2006 Decision (2002/309/EC, Euratom) of the Council and of the Commission as regards the Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation of 4 April 2002 on the conclusion of seven Agreements with the Swiss Confederation, provides in its Article 3 that the position to be taken by the Community as regards decisions of the Community/Switzerland Air Transport Committee which simply extend acts of Community legislation to Switzerland, subject to any technical adjustment needed, shall be adopted by the Commission[1].
Article 2 The Declaration on Swiss attendance of committees contained in the Final Act of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation signed on 21 June 1999 and adopted by the Council on 4 April 2002, is supplemented by a Declaration on Swiss participation in the Single Sky Committee.
The following shall be inserted after the end of point 5 (Aviation Security) of the Annex to the Agreement, as inserted by Article 1(1) of Decision No 1/2005 of the Community/Switzerland Air Transport Committee of 12 July 2005[3]: “ 6.
