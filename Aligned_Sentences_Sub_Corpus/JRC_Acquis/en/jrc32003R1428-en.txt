Applicant group %gt%TABLE%gt% With 212 member bean growers of the Prefecture of Kastoria from all areas growing the product (memorandum of association No 65/7.4.97) who hold 65 % by value of the shares.
The remaining 35 % is a contribution of the Commune of Lakkomata, now a constituent part of the Municipality of Orestida.
The company's structure is governed by Article 2 of PD 410/95 (GG321). 3.
Name: ΦΑΣΟΛΙΑ ΓΙΓΑΝΤΕΣ - ΕΛΕΦΑΝΤΕΣ ΚΑΣΤΟΡΙΑΣ. (Fasolia Gigantes - Elefantes Kastorias) 4.2.
The Phaseolus genus contains 250 species.
The varieties grown in the Prefecture of Kastoria belong to the species Phaseolus coccineus (multiflorus). - The symbiotic association of the nitrogen-fixing Bacterium radicola with the fleshy nodular roots permits absorption of up to 40 kg/ha of atmospheric nitrogen. - The stem is slender, pliant and cylindrical and twines continuously from left to right. - The compound leaves consist of three leaflets. - The flowers comprise a five-part calyx, a five-part white corolla, ten stamens and a pistil.
They are produced in large axillary clusters opening successively from the base to the tip of the plant. - The elephant/giant beans are cross-pollinated plants. - The fruit is a white kidney-shaped pod.
Packaging and presentation (Article 5) In prepackaged beans, the following tolerances apply: (a) broken beans: less than half the whole bean in size: up to 2 %; (b) shrivelled/discoloured beans: up to 0,5 %; (c) foreign matter: up to 0,05 % (maximum earth 0,02 %). 4.3.
The zone's altitude ranges from 630 to 900 metres.
An average annual rainfall of around 600 mm completes the requirements of the water-loving bean plant.
According to radioactive carbon studies Phaseolus coccineus (multiflorus) was domesticated in Mexico around 2000 B.C.
Method of production 4.5.1.
Conservation The separated seeds are if necessary spread out in the sun until they reach the desirable moisture content of around 12 %.
Polypropylene bags holding 1/2 kg and 1 kg will be filled automatically and then put into 10 to 20 kg boxes.
The medium-textured slightly acid soil with excellent drainage and the %quot%Mediterranean-continental%quot% climate of the area are harmoniously collaborating factors in production of the beans that have been part of the life of the inhabitants of the area for 300 years.
