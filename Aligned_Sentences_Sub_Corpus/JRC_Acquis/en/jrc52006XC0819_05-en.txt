Technologie Buczek (hereinafter TB) is a Polish tube producer situated in the Silesia region with a total production capacity of about 60 thousand tonnes.
Given financial difficulties, TB had drawn up a restructuring plan in 2002. 2.
On the basis of the restructuring plan, TB had become eligible for state aid under the national restructuring programme for the Polish steel industry till 2006. 3.
In addition, the protocol prohibits the granting of any restructuring aid between the end 2003 and the end of 2006.
Above that, TB has obtained a budgetary grant for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 for employment restructuring of altogether about EUR 220000.
The Commission notes the non implementation of the restructuring plan and seeks to investigate whether this constitutes a misuse of the restructuring aid granted. 7.
