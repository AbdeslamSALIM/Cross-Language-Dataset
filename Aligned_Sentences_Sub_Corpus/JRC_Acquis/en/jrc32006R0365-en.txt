This investigation has been concluded by Council Regulation (EC) No 366/2006 [7] which amended the level of the definitive anti-dumping measures. (5) On 10 December 2004 [8], the Commission initiated an expiry review of the definitive countervailing measures.
Requests for reviews Request for a review as regards countervailing measures (6) In 2002, a request for a partial interim review, limited in scope to the form of the countervailing measures in respect of one company, was lodged by (Polyplex), an Indian exporting producer from whom an undertaking had already been accepted by Decision 2001/645/EC in connection with the anti-dumping measures in force.
Request for a review as regards countervailing measures (7) In October 2003, a request for a partial interim review limited to the form of the anti-dumping measures was lodged by the following Community producers: Du Pont Teijin Films, Mitsubishi Polyester Film GmbH and Nuroll SpA (the applicants).
The Commission officially informed Polyplex of its intentions in this regard.
Review of the form of the anti-dumping measures (11) On 22 November 2003, the Commission announced by a notice of initiation published in the Official Journal of the European Union [11], the initiation of a partial interim review in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation. (12) The review was limited in scope to the form of the measures applicable to the five Indian exporting producers from whom undertakings had been accepted.
The investigation period was from 1 October 2002 to 30 September 2003 (the current IP). (13) The Commission officially informed the exporting producers, the representatives of the exporting country and the Community producers about the initiation of the review.
Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following exporting producers in India: - Ester Industries Limited, New Delhi, - Flex Industries Limited, New Delhi, - Garware Polyester Limited, Aurangabad, - MTZ Polyfilms Limited, Mumbai, - Polyplex Corporation Limited, New Delhi.
PRODUCT CONCERNED (15) The product concerned is, as defined in the original investigation, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India, normally declared under CN codes ex39206219 and ex39206290.
In the original investigation, the number of MIPs established on the basis of those groupings ranged from 10 to 32 per exporter. (17) In the framework of the current review, a comparison was made, within groupings, of the mix of model types and of price variations between the investigation period used in the original investigation (original IP) and the current IP. (18) The analysis showed that the mix of model types sold under certain product groupings have changed since the acceptance of the undertakings.
The decision to withdraw the undertakings is based on evidence assembled during the investigation that changes in the mix of products make the undertaking inappropriate and that monitoring of sales of this product are unsuited to undertaking agreements (see recitals 18 to 20 and 22).
It was suggested that the withdrawal of the undertakings was being made on speculative, non-material grounds which was devaluing the spirit of Article 15 of the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement and that withdrawal of the undertakings was a violation of the principle of proportionality. (31) Article 15 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement refers to the need to explore constructive remedies before applying anti-dumping duties.
