The Commission initiated an investigation by Regulation (EC) No 499/2006 ('the initiating Regulation') into the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of coumarin originating in the PRC by imports of coumarin consigned from Indonesia or Malaysia, whether declared as originating in Indonesia or Malaysia or not and, pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, directed the customs authorities to register imports of coumarin consigned from Indonesia or Malaysia, whether declared as originating in Indonesia or Malaysia or not, falling within CN code ex 2932 21 00 (TARIC code 2932 21 00 16).
Existing measures (1) Following an expiry review, by Regulation (EC) No 769/2002[2] (‘the original Regulation’), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of EUR 3479 per tonne on imports of coumarin, falling within CN code ex 2932 21 00 originating in the People’s Republic of China (‘PRC’). (2) In December 2004, after circumvention practices via India and Thailand were found, the measures were extended by Regulation (EC) No 2272/2004[3] to imports of coumarin consigned from India or Thailand, whether declared as originating in India or Thailand or not. 2.
Request (3) On 13 February 2006, the Commission received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of coumarin originating in the PRC (‘the request’).
It was further alleged that there was insufficient due cause or economic justification for these practices other than the existence of the anti-dumping measures on imports of coumarin originating in the PRC. (6) Finally, the applicant submitted evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on coumarin originating in the PRC were being undermined both in terms of quantities and prices.
Initiation (7) The Commission initiated an investigation by Regulation (EC) No 499/2006[4] (‘the initiating Regulation’) into the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of coumarin originating in the PRC by imports of coumarin consigned from Indonesia or Malaysia, whether declared as originating in Indonesia or Malaysia or not and, pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, directed the customs authorities to register imports of coumarin consigned from Indonesia or Malaysia, whether declared as originating in Indonesia or Malaysia or not, falling within CN code ex 2932 21 00 (TARIC code 2932 21 00 16). 4.
Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the initiating Regulation.
All parties were informed that non-cooperation might lead to the application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation and findings being made on the basis of the facts available. (9) No producer or exporter in the PRC, Indonesia or Malaysia submitted a reply to the questionnaire.
Investigation period (10) The investigation period covered the period from 1 March 2005 to 28 February 2006 (‘IP’).
General considerations/degree of cooperation (a) Indonesia and Malaysia (11) No producers or exporters of coumarin in Indonesia and Malaysia made themselves known or co-operated in the investigation.
Accordingly, findings in respect of the exports of coumarin consigned from Indonesia and Malaysia to the Community had to be made on the basis of the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
Product concerned and like product (14) The product concerned by the alleged circumvention is, as defined in the original Regulation, coumarin currently classifiable within CN code ex 2932 21 00.
Indonesia (18) As no Indonesian company cooperated in the investigation, exports from Indonesia to the Community had to be established on the basis of the facts available pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
Eurostat data, which were the most appropriate information available, were therefore used to establish the export prices and quantities of imports from Indonesia. (19) Significant imports from Indonesia into the Community started immediately after the initiation of the previous anti-circumvention investigation against India and Thailand, at the level of 12,5 tonnes in 2004, 15 tonnes in 2005 and 10 tonnes in the investigation period (representing 1,7% of the EU consumption).
In parallel, Chinese exports into Indonesia have developed from 57 tonnes in 2003 to 83,8 tonnes in the investigation period. (20) In the absence of cooperation and of any contrary evidence, it is concluded that there was a change in the pattern of trade between the PRC, Indonesia and the Community from 2004 to the end of the investigation period, which stemmed from transhipment of coumarin originating in the PRC via Indonesia.
Malaysia (21) As no Malaysian company cooperated in the investigation, exports from Malaysia to the Community had to be established on the basis of the facts available pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
Eurostat data, which were the most appropriate information available, were therefore used to establish the export prices and quantities of imports from Malaysia. (22) Imports from Malaysia into the Community started in 2005, reaching a level of 13 tonnes in 2005 and 23 tonnes in the investigation period (representing 3,9% of the EU consumption).
At the same time, the Chinese exports into Malaysia have grown from 23,6 tonnes in 2004 to 43,76 tonnes in the investigation period. (23) In the absence of cooperation and of any contrary evidence, it is concluded that there was a change in the pattern of trade between the PRC, Malaysia and the Community from 2005 to the end of the investigation period, which stemmed from transhipment of coumarin originating in the PRC via Malaysia. 4.
While imports declared as originating in Indonesia were absent on the Community market until 2003, they amounted to 4 tonnes in 2003, to 12,5 tonnes in 2004, to 15 tonnes in 2005 and to 10 tonnes in the investigation period, representing 1,7% of Community consumption. (27) The investigation revealed that the imports from Indonesia have taken place at price levels below the export price in the original investigation and well below the original normal value. (28) On the basis of the above, it is concluded that the change in trade flows, together with the abnormally low prices of exports from Indonesia have undermined the remedial effects of the anti-dumping measures both in terms of quantities and prices of the like products.
Evidence of dumping in relation to the normal values previously established for like or similar products Indonesia (32) In order to determine whether evidence of dumping could be found with respect to the exports of coumarin from Indonesia to the Community during the IP, Eurostat data were used pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation. (33) Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation requires evidence of dumping in relation to the normal value previously established for the like or similar products. (34) For the purpose of a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance, in the form of adjustments, was made for differences which affect prices and price comparability.
Malaysia (36) In order to determine whether evidence of dumping could be found with respect to the exports of coumarin from Malaysia to the Community during the IP, Eurostat data were used pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation. (37) For the purpose of a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance, in the form of adjustments, was made for differences which affect prices and price comparability.
MEASURES (39) In view of the above findings of circumvention within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, the existing anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC should be extended to the same product consigned from Indonesia or Malaysia, whether declared as originating in Indonesia or Malaysia or not. (40) The duty extended should be the one established in Article 1(2) of the original Regulation. (41) Pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, which provide that any extended measures shall be applied against registered imports from the date of registration, the anti-dumping duty should be collected on imports of coumarin consigned from Indonesia or Malaysia, which entered the Community under registration imposed by the initiating Regulation.
The definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 769/2002 on imports of coumarin, falling within CN code ex 2932 21 00 originating in the People’s Republic of China is hereby extended to imports of coumarin, falling within CN code ex 2932 21 00 consigned from Indonesia or Malaysia, whether declared as originating in Indonesia or Malaysia or not (TARIC code 2932 21 00 16). 2.
The duty extended by paragraph 1 shall be collected on imports registered in accordance with Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 499/2006 and Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96. 3.
