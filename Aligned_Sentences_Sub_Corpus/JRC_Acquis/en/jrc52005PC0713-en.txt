OPINION OF THE COMMISSION ON THE AMENDMENTS BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT On 26 October 2005, the European Parliament with respect to the Regulation adopted 26 of the 45 amendments that were tabled.
As regards the Directive the European Parliament adopted 1 amendment that the Commission cannot accept. 4.1 The Regulation 4.1.1 Amendments accepted by the Commission 4.1.1.1 Amendments Accepted in Full Amendment 10 introduces the element of “preventing” emissions as well as reducing emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases which is already used in relation to leaks in Article 3.
Amendment 13 further develops the definition of hermetically sealed systems and improves clarity.
The text proposed in relation to amendment 17 might provide a solution to this definition problem.
This inspection for leakage can be carried out by the operator subject to the provisions of Article 5.” Amendment 21 adds in the reporting provision “solvents and fire protection systems” to the main category of applications that will guide producers and importers in their reporting.
Amendment 25 introduces a number of changes with respect to the labelling provisions, notably indication of global warming potential.
This amendment can be accepted with some slight redrafting of the text with the focus on technological innovation as below: “(6a) The application and enforcement of this Regulation should encourage technological innovation by the continued development of alternative technologies that are more environmentally friendly.” Amendment 7 is a new recital that specifies that the regulation should not prevent Member States from maintaining or introducing stricter protective measures.
Amendment 20 requires that companies and their personnel involved in the maintenance and the installation of equipment covered by the Regulation should also be covered by the certification and training requirements.
Amendment 18 changes the word “inspections” to “control measures”.
The rejection of this amendment is in line with the position taken on the same issue in amendments 16 and 17.
Amendment 19 specifies that Member States shall facilitate the cross-border transport of recovered fluorinated greenhouse gases for destruction or reclamation.
Amendment 27 requires the Commission to present legislative proposal by the 31 December 2008 with respect to mobile air-conditioning systems (MACs) in vehicles other than cars and refrigeration systems in transport.
Amendment 42 aims to facilitate the Commission’s role and increase transparency in relation to national measures on F-Gases and also ensure timely Member State notification under Article 176.
Amendment 45 says that the Regulation shall not prevent Member States from keeping or taking stronger protective measures.
Amendment 7 that introduces the same notion in a recital has been accepted in principle.
The provisions of the Treaty are directly applicable, hence this amendment is not acceptable. 4.2 The Directive 4.2.1.
Amendments Accepted in Full None 4.2.1.2.
Amendments Accepted in Part None 4.21.3 Amendments Accepted in Principle None 4.2.2.
Amendments rejected by the Commission Amendment 1 would allow Member States to promote the installation of air conditioning systems using a gas that is efficient and which has a low global warming potential using fiscal or other incentives.
