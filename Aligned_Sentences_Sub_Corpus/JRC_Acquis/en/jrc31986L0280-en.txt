Article 4 The Member States concerned shall be responsible for monitoring the aquatic environment affected by discharges from industrial establishments and by other sources of significant discharges.
Should there be a change in scientific knowledge relating principally to the toxicity, persistence and accumulation of the substances referred to in Article 2 (a) in living organisms and sediments, or in the event of an improvement in the best technical means available, the Commission shall submit appropriate proposals to the Council with the aim of making the limit values and the quality objectives more stringent, if appropriate, or of establishing new limit values and additional quality objectives.
Member States shall bring into force the measures necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 January 1988.
Article 8 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

WINSEMIUS (1)OJ N° L 129, 18. 5. 1976, p. 23. (2)OJ N° C 70, 18. 3. 1985, p. 15. (3)OJ N° C 120, 20. 5. 1986. (4)OJ N° C 188, 29. 7. 1985, p. 19. (5)OJ N° L 20, 26. 1. 1980, p. 43.
However, because the concentration of these substances in effluents depends on the volume of water involved, which varies for different processes and plants, the limit values expressed in terms of the weight of the substances discharged in relation to the parameters characteristic of the activity given under heading A in Annex II, must be complied with in all cases. 5.A monitoring procedure must be instituted to check whether the discharges of the substances referred to in Article 2 (a) comply with the emission standards.
HEADING C Reference methods of measurement and limit of detection 1.The definitions given in Council Directive 79/869/EEC of 9 October 1979 concerning the methods of measurement and frequencies of sampling and analysis of surface water intended for the abstraction of drinking water in the Member States(1) will apply in the context of this Directive. 2.The reference methods of measurement to be used for determining the concentration of the substances in question and the limit of detection for the environment concerned are set out under heading C in Annex II. 3.The limit of detection, the accuracy and the precision of the method are specified for each substance under heading C in Annex II. 4.Effluent flow measurements must be carried out to an accuracy of ± 20 %. (1)OJ N° L 271, 29. 10. 1979, p. 44.
ANNEX II SPECIFIC PROVISIONS 1.Relating to carbon tetrachloride 2.Relating to DDT 3.Relating to pentachlorophenol The numbering of the substances listed in this Annex corresponds to the list of 129 substances contained in the communication from the Commission to the Council of 22 June 1982(1).
A sensitive detector must be used when concentration levels are below 0,5 mg/l and in this case the determination limit(1) is 0,1 ìg/l.
For concentration levels higher than 0,5 mg/l a determination limit(1) of 0,1 mg/l is acceptable. 2.The accuracy and precision of the method must be ± 50 % at a concentration which represents twice the value of the determination limit(1).
The limit of determination(1) for total DDT is approximately 4 ìg/l for the aquatic environment and 1 ìg/l for effluents, depending on the number of extraneous substances present in the sample. 2.The reference method to be used for determining DDT in sediments and organisms is gas chromatography with electron capture detection after appropriate preparation of samples.
The limit of determination(1) is 1 ìg/kg. 3.The accuracy and precision of the method must be ± 50 % at a concentration which represents twice the value of the limit of determination(1).
The limit of determination(1) is 2 ìg/l for effluents and 0,1 ìg/l for the aquatic environment. 2.The reference method to be used for determining pentachlorophenol in sediments and organisms is high-pressure liquid chromatography or gas chromatography with electroncapture detection after appropriate preparation of samples.
The limit of determination(1) is 1 mg/kg. 3.The accuracy and precision of the method must be ± 50 % at a concentration which represents twice the value of the limit of determination(1). (1)OJ N° C 176, 14. 7. 1982, p. 3. (1)Article 5 applies in particular to use of carbon tetrachloride in industrial laundries. (2)CAS (Chemical Abstract Service) number. (1)The 'determination limit' xg of a given substance is the smallest quantity, quantitatively determinable in a sample on the basis of a given working method, which can still be distinguished from zero. (1)The sum of the isomers 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2 bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethane; 1,1,1-trichloro-2 (o-chlorophenyl) -2- (p-chlorophenyl) ethane; 1,1,1-dichloro-2,2 bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene; and 1,1,1-dichloro-2,2 bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethane. (2)Article 5 applies to DDT if sources other than those mentioned in this Annex are identified. (3)CAS (Chemical Abstract Service) number. (1)The 'limit of determination' xg of a given substance is the smallest quantity, quantitatively determinable in a sample on the basis of a given working method, which can still be distinguished from zero. (1)The chemical compound 2,3,4,5,6-Pentachloro-1-hydroxybenzene and its salts. (2)Article 5 applies to pentachlorophenol, and particularly to its use for treating wood. (3)CAS (Chemical Abstract Service) number. (1)The 'limit of determination' xg of a given substance is the smallest quantity, quantitatively determinable in a sample on the basis of a given working method, which can still be distinguished from zero.
