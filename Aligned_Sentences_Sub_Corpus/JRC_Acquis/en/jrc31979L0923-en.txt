MEMBER STATES SHALL , INITIALLY WITHIN A TWO-YEAR PERIOD FOLLOWING THE NOTIFICATION OF THIS DIRECTIVE , DESIGNATE SHELLFISH WATERS . 2 .
MEMBER STATES MAY SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE ADDITIONAL DESIGNATIONS . 3 .
MEMBER STATES MAY REVISE THE DESIGNATION OF CERTAIN WATERS OWING IN PARTICULAR TO FACTORS UNFORESEEN AT THE TIME OF DESIGNATION , TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PRINCIPLE SET OUT IN ARTICLE 8 .

FOR THE PURPOSES OF IMPLEMENTING ARTICLE 5 , THE DESIGNATED WATERS SHALL BE DEEMED TO CONFORM TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS DIRECTIVE IF SAMPLES OF SUCH WATERS , TAKEN AT THE MINIMUM FREQUENCY SPECIFIED IN THE ANNEX , AT THE SAME SAMPLING POINT AND OVER A PERIOD OF 12 MONTHS , SHOW THAT THEY CONFORM TO BOTH THE VALUES SET BY THE MEMBER STATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 3 AND THE COMMENTS CONTAINED IN COLUMNS G AND I OF THE ANNEX , AS REGARDS : - 100 % OF THE SAMPLES FOR THE PARAMETERS ' ORGANOHALOGENATED SUBSTANCES ' AND ' METALS ' ; - 95 % OF THE SAMPLES FOR THE PARAMETERS ' SALINITY ' AND ' DISSOLVED OXYGEN ' ; - 75 % OF THE SAMPLES FOR THE OTHER PARAMETERS LISTED IN THE ANNEX .
IF , IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 7 ( 2 ), THE SAMPLING FREQUENCY FOR ALL THE PARAMETERS IN THE ANNEX EXCEPT ' ORGANOHALOGENATED SUBSTANCES ' AND ' METALS ' IS LOWER THAN THAT INDICATED IN THE ANNEX , THE ABOVEMENTIONED VALUES AND COMMENTS SHALL BE COMPLIED WITH IN THE CASE OF ALL THE SAMPLES . 2 .
INSTANCES IN WHICH THE VALUES SET BY MEMBER STATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 3 OR THE COMMENTS CONTAINED IN COLUMNS G AND I OF THE ANNEX ARE NOT RESPECTED SHALL NOT BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE CALCULATION OF THE PERCENTAGES PROVIDED FOR IN PARAGRAPH 1 WHEN IT IS THE RESULT OF A DISASTER .

THE EXACT SAMPLING POINT , THE DISTANCE FROM THIS POINT TO THE NEAREST POINT WHERE POLLUTANTS ARE DISCHARGED AND THE DEPTH AT WHICH THE SAMPLES ARE TO BE TAKEN SHALL BE FIXED BY THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY OF EACH MEMBER STATE ON THE BASIS OF LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN PARTICULAR . 5 .
ARTICLE 8 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MEASURES TAKEN PURSUANT TO THIS DIRECTIVE MAY ON NO ACCOUNT LEAD , EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY , TO INCREASED POLLUTION OF COASTAL AND BRACKISH WATERS .
ARTICLE 9 MEMBER STATES MAY AT ANY TIME SET MORE STRINGENT VALUES FOR DESIGNATED WATERS THAN THOSE LAID DOWN IN THIS DIRECTIVE .
ARTICLE 10 WHERE A MEMBER STATE CONSIDERS DESIGNATING SHELLFISH WATERS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF A FRONTIER WITH ANOTHER MEMBER STATE , THESE STATES SHALL CONSULT EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE STRETCHES OF SUCH WATERS TO WHICH THIS DIRECTIVE MIGHT APPLY AND THE CONSEQUENCES TO BE DRAWN FROM THE COMMON QUALITY OBJECTIVES ; THESE CONSEQUENCES SHALL BE DETERMINED , AFTER FORMAL CONSULTATIONS , BY EACH STATE CONCERNED .
THE COMMISSION MAY PARTICIPATE IN THESE DELIBERATIONS .
ARTICLE 11 THE MEMBER STATES MAY DEROGATE FROM THIS DIRECTIVE IN THE EVENT OF EXCEPTIONAL WEATHER OR GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS .

ARTICLE 13 FOR THE PURPOSE OF APPLYING THIS DIRECTIVE , MEMBER STATES SHALL PROVIDE THE COMMISSION WITH INFORMATION CONCERNING : - THE WATERS DESIGNATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 4 ( 1 ) AND ( 2 ), IN SUMMARY FORM , - THE REVISION OF THE DESIGNATION OF CERTAIN WATERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 4 ( 3 ), - THE PROVISIONS LAID DOWN IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH NEW PARAMETERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 9 .
WHERE A MEMBER STATE APPLIES THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE 11 , IT SHALL FORTHWITH NOTIFY THE COMMISSION THEREOF , STATING ITS REASONS AND THE PERIODS ANTICIPATED .
