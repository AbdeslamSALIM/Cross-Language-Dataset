PROVISIONAL MEASURES (1) The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91 (2), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters (hereinafter referred to as lighters) originating in Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Thailand and falling within CN code ex 9613 10 00 (Taric code: 9613 10 00 * 10).
DUMPING (6) The Thai producer and exporter, Thai Merry Co.
Consequently, the dumping margin as a percentage of cif value, with regard to that undertaking, has been modified to 14,14 %. (7) Given the fact that Thailand has been used as the analogue country for calculating normal value for China, the dumping margin for the People's Republic of China also required to be modified and is now 16,94 %. (8) A Chinese exporter, Gladstrong Investments Ltd, which did not export to the Community during the reference period requested to be excluded from the application of the duty.
It was argued that Article 2 (5) should not be applied since imports to the Community were not made from the People's Republic China but from Hong Kong and that Gao Yao Co. (Hong Kong) should be considered as an exporter and not Gao Yao Co. (China).
The Council, however, confirms that in this case the products concerned were merely transhipped through Hong Kong and therefore the normal value should be determined in accordance with Article 2 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. (11) The exporters from Thailand argued that the profit margin of 8 %, added to the cost of production for the determination of the normal value, was too high.
All domestic sales of Thai Merry Co.
Therefore, the Commission established a profit margin of 8 % on the basis of the profit realized by other exporters from those countries which cooperated in this procedure. (12) In the light of the above, the Council confirms the conclusions set out in recitals 19 to 29 of Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91 taking into account the corrections mentioned above with regard to Thai Merry Co.
The definitive weighted average margins expressed as a percentage of cif value for each of the exporters concerned are as follows: Japan Tokai Corporation, Yokohama 96,56 %, People's Republic of China 16,94 %, Republic of Korea Samji Industrial, Inchon 31,58 %, Thailand Politop Co.
Ltd, Bangkok 5,87 %, Thai Merry Co.
Ltd, Samutsakorn 14,14 %.
INJURY THRESHOLD (16) With regard to the calculation to determine the injury elimination level, the Commission considered it appropriate that the difference between actual selling prices of the exporters and a price which would allow the Community industry to achieve 15 % profit should be eliminated.
This 15 % profit margin has been contested by the Japanese producer and exporter as being too high. (17) According to the Community producers, a 15 % profit margin is the minimum necessary to finance new investments in manufacturing facilities and research and development, without which the deterioration of the situation of the industry would be bound to be exacerbated and the injury caused by dumping would not be entirely removed.
Consideration was given to the fact that the profit achieved by the major world producers has always ranged between 12 and 20 %.
Ltd and Politop Co.
The duties, therefore, shall be: - Tokai Corporation, Japan 35,7 %, - Samji Industrial, Republic of Korea 22,7 %, - Gao Yao Co., People's Republic of China 16,9 %, - Thai Merry Co.
Ltd, Thailand 14,1 %, - Politop Co.
Ltd, Thailand 5,8 %. (22) The Council confirms, for the reasons stated by the Commission in recital 60 of Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91, that the highest duty established for each country should be applied to firms which did not respond to the Commission questionnaire or otherwise did not make themselves known to the Commission.
UNDERTAKING (23) One of the two Thai exporters, Thai Merry Co.
