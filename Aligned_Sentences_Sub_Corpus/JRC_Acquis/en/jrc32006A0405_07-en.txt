Following a comfortable surplus in 2000, the general government balance deteriorated sharply, turning into a deficit in 2001 and 2002 and exceeding the 3 % of GDP threshold in 2003.
A substantial budgetary consolidation was achieved already in 2004, which reduced the deficit to 2,1 % of GDP in 2004.
The programme broadly follows the model structure for stability and convergence programmes specified in the new code of conduct [2]. (6) The programme projects real GDP growth to increase from an estimated 0,75 % in 2005 to 2,5 % in both 2006 and 2007, before slowing to 2,25 % in 2008.
After the substantial consolidation achieved in 2004 and 2005, the 2005 update of the stability programme projects the general government deficit to increase to 1,5 % in 2006 and subsequently to stabilise at around 1,1 % of GDP, with the primary surplus following a similar pattern.
Half of this structural deterioration reflects the fact that companies paid higher-than-expected tax advances in 2005 to take advantage of above-market interest rates paid by the Government, with an expected mirror effect in 2006.
The projected structural balance in every year falls within the MTO range as specified in the programme and is better than the minimum benchmark of a structural deficit of around 1 % of GDP, which ensures a sufficient margin against breaching the 3 % of GDP threshold in case of adverse cyclical developments.
If the recent information on the positive outcome in 2005 is confirmed, the fiscal deterioration implied by the 2006 target could even be larger, unless the authorities take measures to contain it. (11) The programme projects the government debt to broadly stabilise in 2006 at 54,5 % of GDP before gradually decreasing to around 53 % in 2008.
The current level of debt is under the Treaty value of 60 % of GDP and the recent improvement of the budgetary situation in the Netherlands has helped alleviate risks to long-term sustainability.
