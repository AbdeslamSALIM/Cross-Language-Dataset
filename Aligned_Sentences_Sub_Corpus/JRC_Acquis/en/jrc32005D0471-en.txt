2005/471/EC: Commission Decision of 27 November 2002 relating to proceedings under Article 81 of the EC Treaty against BPB PLC, Gebr&amp;uuml;der Knauf Westdeutsche Gipswerke KG, Soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; Lafarge SA and Gyproc Benelux NV (Case No COMP/E-1/37.152 &amp;mdash; Plasterboard) (notified under document number C(2002) 4570) Commission Decision of 27 November 2002 relating to proceedings under Article 81 of the EC Treaty against BPB PLC, Gebrüder Knauf Westdeutsche Gipswerke KG, Société Lafarge SA and Gyproc Benelux NV (Case No COMP/E-1/37.152 — Plasterboard) (notified under document number C(2002) 4570) (Only the English, French, German and Dutch versions are authentic) (2005/471/EC) On 27 November 2002, the Commission adopted a decision relating to a proceeding under Article 81 of the EC Treaty.
In accordance with the provisions of Article 30 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 [1] replacing Article 21 of Regulation No 17 [2], the Commission herewith publishes the names of the parties and the main content of the decision, having regard to the legitimate interest of undertakings in the protection of their business interests.
Addressees (1) The following undertakings are the addressees of this Decision relating to the infringement of Article 81 of the Treaty: - BPB plc (hereinafter: BPB), - Gebrüder Knauf Westdeutsche Gipswerke KG (hereinafter: Knauf Westdeutsche Gipswerke), - Société Lafarge SA (hereinafter: Lafarge), - Gyproc Benelux NV (hereinafter: Gyproc). 2.
Nature of the infringement (2) BPB, Knauf [3], Lafarge and Gyproc entered into and participated without interruption in a complex and continuing agreement contrary to Article 81(1) of the Treaty which was manifested in the following conduct constituting agreements or concerted practices: - the representatives of BPB and Knauf met in London in 1992 and expressed the common desire to stabilise the markets in Germany (hereinafter: German market), the United Kingdom (hereinafter: UK market), France (hereinafter: French market) and the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg (hereinafter: Benelux market), - the representatives of BPB and Knauf established, as from 1992, information exchange arrangements, to which Lafarge and subsequently Gyproc acceded, relating to their sales volumes on the German, French, UK and Benelux plasterboard markets, - the representatives of BPB, Knauf and Lafarge exchanged information, on various occasions, prior to price increases on the UK market, - in view of particular developments on the German market, the representatives of BPB, Knauf, Lafarge and Gyproc met at Versailles in 1996, Brussels in 1997 and The Hague in 1998 with a view to sharing out or at least stabilising the German market, - the representatives of BPB, Knauf, Lafarge and Gyproc exchanged information on various occasions and concerted their action on the application of price increases on the German market between 1996 and 1998. 3.
Following these inspections, the Commission sent requests for information to certain undertakings in January, July and September 1999 and in March 2000. (5) On 18 April 2001, the Commission initiated proceedings in this case and adopted a statement of objections against five undertakings, namely: BPB, Knauf, Lafarge, Gyproc and Etex SA.
Plasterboard is a well-known product and the firms concerned are house-hold names in several Member States (one talks of buying "gyproc" in Belgium, "placoplâtre" in France, etc.). (8) The annual value of sales on the Benelux, French, German and UK markets covered by the present Decision was some ECU 1210 million in 1997 and 1998 for a sales volume of some 692 million square metres in 1997 and some 710 million square meters in 1998.
The starting amount of the fine determined for gravity is therefore increased by 65 % for BPB and Knauf Westdeutsche Gipswerke, by 60 % for Lafarge and by 20 % for Gyproc. 2.
Aggravating circumstances (15) The Commission has previously adopted measures imposing fines on BPB De Eendracht NV [4] (a member of the BPB group, addressee of the draft Decision) for having taken part in an illegal agreement in the cartonboard sector and on Lafarge SA (then known as Lafarge Coppée SA) for having taken part in an illegal agreement in the cement sector [5]. (16) The facts as set out in the Decision establish that BPB and Lafarge actively continued to participate in a cartel in the plasterboard sector after the abovementioned Decisions were notified to them.
The mere fact that an undertaking has already been the subject of an infringement Decision and that, in spite of this finding and of the fine imposed, it has continued to engage in another analogous infringement in breach of the same provision of the Treaty is sufficient to constitute recidivism. (18) With regard to the above aggravating factors, an increase of 50 % of the basic amount of the fine for BPB and Lafarge appears justified. 3.
Attenuating circumstances (19) Whilst Gyproc may be held responsible for the infringement as a whole for the period during which it was a participant, that is from June 1996 to November 1998, the available evidence shows that Gyproc was in an objectively different situation from that of the other addressees of the Decision, such that the Commission recognises that Gyproc did not play an identical role in the agreement to that of the other undertakings.
The distinguishing circumstances recognised by the Commission are the fact that: during a substantial period of its involvement in the agreement, Gyproc appears to have had difficulties in preventing BPB from obtaining and transmitting information relating to it, as a result of BPB’s being represented on Gyproc’s board of directors; Gyproc was a constant destabilising element and contributed to the limitation of the effects of the agreement on the German market; and Gyproc was absent from the UK market where the agreement most frequently manifested itself. (20) Gyproc will therefore be granted a 25 % reduction of the basic amount of the fine on the grounds of attenuating circumstances. 4.
Gyproc does not contest the facts or their qualification as infringements of Community competition law. (24) In the above circumstances, the Commission considers that it is appropriate to grant a 30 % reduction in the amount of the fine for BPB and a 40 % reduction in the amount of the fine for Gyproc. 5.
In their plasterboard business they shall refrain from any agreement or concerted practice that might have an identical or similar object or effect to the infringement. (29) In respect of the infringement referred to in Article 1, the following fines are imposed on the following undertakings: BPB plc: EUR 138,6 million, Gebrüder Knauf Westdeutsche Gipswerke KG: EUR 85,8 million, Société Lafarge SA: EUR 249,6 million, Gyproc Benelux NV: EUR 4,32 million.

On 14 May 1998, in Case T-311/94, the Court of First Instance reduced the fine to ECU 750000 (ECR 1998, II-1129). [5] Commission Decision 94/815/EC of 30 November 1994, Cases IV/33.126 and 33.322 — Cement, (OJ L 343, 30.12.1994, p. 1), relating to a procedure under Article 85 (now 81) of the EC Treaty imposed a fine of ECU 22872000.
On 15 March 2000, in Case T 43/95, the Court of First Instance reduced the fine to EUR 14248000 (ECR 2000, II-491).
