Article 2 The analytical reference procedure of choice must be based preferably on atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and must have a limit of detection which is equal to or lower than that of the procedure used for routine analyses.
Article 3 The criteria applicable to the analytical reference procedure are set out in the Annex.
Article 5 This Decision is addressed to the Member States.

For the Commission Ray MAC SHARRY Member of the Commission (1) OJ No 121, 29. 7. 1964, p. 2012/64. (2) OJ No L 395, 30. 12. 1989, p. 13. (3) OJ No L 351, 2. 12. 1989, p. 39. (4) OJ No L 275, 26. 9. 1986, p. 36.
Definitions 1.2.1.
The definition which shall be used is laid down in ISO 3534-1977 under 2.83 (accuracy of the mean: the closeness of agreement between the true value and the mean result which would be obtained by applying the experimental procedure a very large number of times).
The measure of accuracy is the difference between the mean value obtained analyzing a certified reference material and its certified value expressed as a percentage of the certified value. 1.2.6.
In atomic absorption spectrometry, especially, with the graphite furnace technique, erroneous (too high) values can be obtained due to inadequate background correction.
Typical residue levels in various sample materials are listed in the EEC Handbook of experimental data for reference methods (to be published). 2.
Positive result: if, according to the analytical procedure, the measured content of the analyte in the sample is equal to or higher than the established maximum permitted level plus n times the standard deviation corresponding to the maximum coefficient of variation allowed for the method as stated in section 1.2.11.1.3 for the level concerned, the sample has a content exceeding the maximum permitted level.
The result of the analysis is 'positive'. 2.2.2.
Note 2: The value of n should be defined according to the risk, acceptable by the authorities for false positive or false negative results. 2.3.
The selectivity (1.2.4) of the method shall be indicated together with the numerical values of the limit of detection (1.2.7.) and the limit of quantitifaction (1.2.11.1.1) of the procedure for the analyte and matrix under investigation.
Note: This information can be obtained from experimental data and taking account of theoretical considerations. (1) OJ No L 372, 31. 12. 1985, p. 50. 2.3.3.2.
The positive or negative result of the analysis will hold only within the restrictions of selectivity and limit of quantification of the procedure for the analyte and matrix under investigation. 2.3.3.3.
In these cases final digestion with perchloric acid and/or hydrogen peroxide is appropriate. 2.4.5.
