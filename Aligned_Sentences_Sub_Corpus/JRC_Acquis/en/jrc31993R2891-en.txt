For all carcase presentations, if the head is not removed, trachea, oesophagus and crop may remain in the carcase.`; 4.
These defective units may also comprise, in the case of breast fillet, fillets with up to 2 % in weight of cartilage (flexible tip of sternum).
However, the number of defective units not complying with the provisions of points 1 and 3 of provisions of Article 1 (1) and (3) as well as Article 6 (1) shall not exceed the figures shown in column 4 of the table contained in paragraph 3.
In the checking of a batch of class B poultrymeat, the tolerable number of defective units shall be doubled.`; 5.
Without prejudice to paragraphs 6 and 10, frozen and quick-frozen chickens may be marketed by way of business or trade within the Community only if the water content does not exceed the technically unavoidable values determined by the method of analysis described in Annex V (drip method) or that in VI (chemical method). 2.
The competent authorities designated by each Member State shall ensure that the slaughterhouses adopt all measures necessary to comply with the provisions of paragraph 1 and in particular that: - samples for monitoring water absorption during chilling and water content of frozen and quick-frozen chickens are taken, - results of the checks are recorded and kept for a period of one year, - each batch is marked in such a way that its date of production can be identified; this batch mark must appear on the production record. 3.
Where these checks reveal that the amount of water absorbed is greater than the total water content permitted under the terms of this Regulation, account being taken of the water absorbed by the carcases during the stages of processing which are not subject to checking, and where, in any case, the amount of water absorbed is greater than the levels referred to in point 9 of Annex VII, or in point 7 of Annex V, the necessary technical adjustments shall be made immediately by the slaughterhouse to the process. 4.
In all cases referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3 and in any case at least once a fortnight, checks on water content referred to in paragraph 1 shall be carried out, by sampling, on frozen and quick frozen chickens from each slaughterhouse according to Annexes V or VI, to be chosen by the competent authority of the Member State.
The competent authorities may, in specific cases, apply the provisions of paragraph 3, and in particular of points 1 and 9 of Annex VII, and of paragraph 4 more stringently in respect of a given slaughterhouse, where this proves necessary to ensure compliance with the total water content permitted under this Regulation. 6.
If the result of the checks referred to in paragraph 4 is in excess of the admissible limits, the batch concerned shall be deemed not to comply with this Regulation.
Where, if necessary after such counter-analysis, the batch in question is deemed not to comply with this Regulation, the competent authority shall take the appropriate measures aimed at allowing such a batch to be marketed within the Community only on condition such a batch to be marketed within the Community only on condition that both individual and bulk packaging of the carcases concerned shall be marked by the slaughterhouse under the supervision of the competent authority with a tape or label bearing at least one of the following forms of wording in red capital letters: %quot%Contenido en agua superior al límite CEE%quot% %quot%Vandindhold overstiger EØF-Normen%quot% %quot%Wassergehalt über dem EWG-Höchstwert%quot% %quot%Ðåñéåêôéêüôçôá óå íåñü áíþôåñç ôïõ ïñßïõ ÅÏÊ%quot% %quot%Water content exceeds EEC limit%quot% %quot%Teneur en eau supérieure à la limite CEE%quot% %quot%Tenore d'acqua superiore al limite CEE%quot% %quot%Watergehalte hoger dan het EEG-maximum%quot% %quot%Teor de água superior ao limite CEE%quot%.
If the results of the checks referred to in paragraph 8 is in excess of the admissible limits, the holder of the batch concerned may request that a counter-analysis be carried out using a method of his choice in one of the reference laboratories listed in Annex VIII, or in any other laboratory approved for this purpose by the competent authorities.
Tasks and competences of reference laboratories are provided for in Annex IX. 11.
Where the checks referred to in paragraphs 8 and 10 show repeated irregularities, or where such checks, in the view of the Member State or dispatch, are being carried out without sufficient justification, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall inform the Commission.
The Commission, to the extent necessary to ensure uniform application of this Regulation or at the request of the competent authority of the Member State of destination, and taking into account the nature of the infringements may: - send a mission of experts to the establishment concerned, and in conjunction with the competent national authorities, carry out on-the-spot inspections, or - request the competent authority of the Member State of dispatch to intensify its sampling of the products of the establishment concerned and if necessary to apply sanctions in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90.
Article 2 Regulations (EEC) No 2967/76 and (EEC) No 2785/80 are repealed.
Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 December 1993.
Article 1 point 7 and Article 2 shall apply as from 1 March 1994.
