Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee on JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro-to-Medium Enterprises) Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee on JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro-to-Medium Enterprises) (2006/C 110/08) On 20 December 2005 Margot Wallström, member of the European Commission, asked the European Economic and Social Committee, on behalf of the European Commission, to draw up an opinion on the joint initiative: JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro-to-Medium Enterprises).
At its 425th plenary session, held on 15 and 16 March 2006 (meeting of 15 March), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 142 votes to one with two abstentions. 1.
Conclusions and recommendations 1.1 The European Economic and Social Committee welcomes the Commission document presenting the JEREMIE programme [1] (Joint European Resources for Micro-to-Medium Enterprises) with keen interest. 1.1.1 The Committee is grateful to Danuta Hübner, Commissioner responsible for regional policy, as well as DG Regio and the EIF, for the efforts they are making in developing this delicate programme and for the support they have given to the Committee's work. 1.1.2 The EESC has always supported Commission initiatives to facilitate access to credit for micro-enterprises and SMEs, being convinced — as is the European Parliament — that aspect has always represented a weak point for smaller businesses. 1.1.3 Strengthening small businesses represents a fundamental element in the Lisbon strategy, since it ties in with innovation, generates stable employment and contributes to the ongoing training of the workforce. 1.1.4 In numerous opinions, and especially those drawn up since 1982 [2], the EESC has highlighted the efforts made by the Commission, DG XXIII [3] in particular, to help businesses improve their links with the credit system, particularly banks. 1.1.5 The EESC has also emphasised the need for the broad-based involvement of the social partners in all enterprise-related problems and, in particular, those concerning credit, since they have a considerable impact on social well-being and development. 1.2 Throughout the 1990s, DG XXIII [4] sought to act on credit problems, working in close contact with organisations representing the crafts sector and SMEs.
The fourth such programme (2005-2005), which has been extended to cover the whole of 2006, was adopted on 20 December 2000; - laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) [8], which is geared to SMEs and has clearly-defined aims; - explained to SMEs the need for them to form networks in order to achieve economies of scale, greater market penetration capacity and, lastly, the critical mass needed for both innovation processes and to build up their leverage with financial institutions.
Reasons 2.1 The EESC has repeatedly underlined the role — not only economic, but also social — played by small businesses in their respective Member States, and has drawn specific attention to this in several opinions, including those issued in 1992 [13], 1997 [14], 2001 [15] and 2003 [16], together with others on the European Charter for Small Enterprises [17]. 2.1.1 Micro and small businesses perform an essential role in the European economy.
The following are necessary in 90 % of cases: - launching information and consultancy initiatives to facilitate the choice of type of capital between the available alternatives (risk capital, debt instruments or mezzanine finance); - selecting the financial tools and methods to use. 2.1.7 Among these instruments, risk capital is often mistrusted by small enterprises.
Only 5 or 6 % of the myriad micro [21] and small [22] businesses (90 % of which are individual companies or partnerships) make use of venture capital.
If JEREMIE can rationalise and amplify what the EU is already doing through EIB and EIF activities, it can save many of the businesses which are currently forced to close down every year (20 %). - The risk evaluation carried out by credit consortia and the ensuing cover of 50 % of the insolvencies concerning the loans granted provides practical relief for the banks from some of their burdens, reduces the scale of risk and in consequence moderates the lending interest rate [36]. 2.5 The function of multipliers in credit management and the function of JEREMIE 2.5.1 Over the last few years in particular, the multiplier instrument has been analysed and used by both credit consortia and banks to boost credit possibilities [37].
These instruments are by far the largest item of expenditure under the fourth MAP: in 2003, for example, they accounted for 67 % of the programme's total budget [48].

[3] In the wake of the problems which emerged in 1982, the Commission also set up a Task Force, headed by Commissioner Cresson, to gear European policies to the needs of SMEs.
In the course of the second half of the 1980s, the Task Force became DG XXIII. [4] Now the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (Enterprise DG). [5] Held in Avignon in 1990, Berlin in 1994 and Milan in 1997. [6] See footnote 28. [7] On 20 and 21 November 1997, the Luxembourg Extraordinary European Council, whose agenda contained a single item – employment – launched three practical initiatives to help businesses stay competitive in the markets, and called upon the Commission to put forward proposals that would boost the business sector and promote employment in that field.
