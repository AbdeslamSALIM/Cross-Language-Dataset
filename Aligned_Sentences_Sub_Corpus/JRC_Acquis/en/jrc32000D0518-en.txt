In their field of responsibility, the cantonal authorities may have to transfer personal data to public authorities in neighbouring countries, mainly for the purpose of mutual assistance to safeguard important public interests or, in the case of public hospitals, to protect the vital interest of the persons concerned. (9) On 2 October 1997, Switzerland ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention No 108)(3), which aims to reinforce the protection of personal data and to ensure free circulation between the contracting parties, subject to any exceptions which these parties may provide for.
If the information collected under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 provides evidence that any body responsible for ensuring compliance with the standards of protection in Switzerland is not effectively fulfilling its role, the Commission shall inform the competent Swiss authority and, if necessary, present draft measures in accordance with the procedure under Article 31 of Directive 95/46/EC with a view to repealing or suspending this Decision or limiting its scope.
The Commission shall, if necessary, present draft measures in accordance with the procedure established by Article 31 of Directive 95/46/EC.
Article 6 This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
