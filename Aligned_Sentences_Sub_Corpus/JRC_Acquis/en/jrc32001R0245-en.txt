In order to permit some flexibility in the trade concerned, the possibilities for transferring contracts among authorised primary processors should be subject to a limit. (10) With a view to sound management of the aid scheme, the information that must be forwarded by the operators to the competent authorities of the Member State and the notifications to be made to the Commission by the Member States must be stipulated. (11) In order to manage a scheme based on aid granted on the basis of the quantities of fibre produced over a period of 22 months, provision should be made for the lodging, at the start of processing operations for a given marketing year, of aid applications covering fibre to be obtained, the quantities of which are to be indicated periodically thereafter. (12) On account of the possible adjustments to the national guaranteed quantities and the unit quantities per hectare, the total quantities of fibre on which the aid can be granted are known only after processing is completed.
Such securities must comply with certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1932/1999(8).
