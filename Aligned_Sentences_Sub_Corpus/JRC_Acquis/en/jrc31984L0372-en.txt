Article 4 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
For the Commission Karl-Heinz NARJES Member of the Commission (1) OJ No L 42, 23. 2. 1970, p. 1. (2) OJ No L 375, 31. 12. 1980, p. 34. (3) OJ No L 42, 23. 2. 1970, p. 16. (4) OJ No L 131, 18. 5. 1981, p. 6.
Approach speed The vehicle must approach the line AA' at a steady speed corresponding to the lower of the following two speeds: - the speed corresponding to an engine speed equal to three-quarters of the speed, S, at which the engine develops its rated maximum power, - 50 km/h.
However, if in the case of vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission having more than two discrete ratios there is a change-down to first gear during the test, the manufacturer may select either of the following test procedures: - the speed, V, of the vehicle shall be increased to a maximum of 60 km/h in order to avoid such a change-down, or - the speed, V, shall remain at 50 km/h and the fuel supply to the engine shall be limited to 95 % of the supply necessary for full load.
This condition is considered to be satisfied: - in the case of a spark-ignition engine, when the angle of the throttle opening is 90 %, and - in the case of a compression-ignition engine, when the movement of the central rack of the injection pump is limited to 90 % of its travel.
However, the vehicles in category M1 having more than four forward gears and equipped with an engine developing a maximum power greater than 140 kW, and whose permissible maximum-power/maximum-mass ratio exceeds 75 kW/t, may be tested in third gear only, provided that the speed at which the rear of the vehicle passes the line BB' in third gear is greater than 61 km/h.' Point 5.2.2.4.3.3.2 is hereby replaced by the following: '5.2.2.4.3.3.2.
