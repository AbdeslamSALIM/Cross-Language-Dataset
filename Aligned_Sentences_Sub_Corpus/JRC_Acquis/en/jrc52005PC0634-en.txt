Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of clean road transport vehicles {SEC(2005) 1588} /* COM/2005/0634 final - COD 2005/0283 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 21.12.2005 COM(2005) 634 final 2005/0283 (COD) Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the promotion of clean road transport vehicles (presented by the Commission) {SEC(2005) 1588} EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The Commission, in its Green Paper on the security of energy supply [COM(2000) 769: "Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply"] published in 2000, highlighted the continuing growth of the transport sector and the related high level of energy consumption, CO2 emissions and dependence on oil.
In 2001, the Commission's White Paper on the European transport policy for 2010 [COM(2001) 370: "European Transport policy for 2010: time to decide"] also noted the need for further measures to combat emissions from transport and stated that the Commission would encourage the development of a market for "clean vehicles".
In particular, the Helsinki European Council in 1999 agreed a strategy on the integration of environment and sustainable development in transport policy (Council document 11717/99).
The Gothenburg European Council in 2001 re-affirmed the importance of a Community strategy for sustainable development, in particular with respect to pro-active measures in the transport sector.
Relating to Heavy Duty Vehicles, Euro IV standards are in force from October 2005 and the Euro V standards will enter into force in 2008.
Also, the Commission has recently presented a proposal for a Directive (COM(2005) 261 of 5 July 2005) requiring taxation of passenger cars to be based at least partially on CO2 emissions in order to encourage the purchasing of cleaner and more energy-efficient vehicles.
It also includes, in its 3rd "whereas", an invitation to Member States to apply coordinated fiscal incentives for passenger cars fulfilling stricter than Euro 4 polluting emission limits and for expediting the placing on the market of cars satisfying future requirements (Euro 5).
Impact assessments on different approaches, based either on technology or performance standards have been carried out.
The impact assessment has shown that a positive impact on environment and on competitiveness of European industry can be expected.
Total annual vehicle procurement by public authorities has been estimated to be in the order of 110 000 passenger cars, 110 000 light duty vehicles, 35 000 lorries and 17 000 buses for EU-25.
Article 2 defines public body and clean vehicles for the purposes of the Directive.
Article 3 creates an obligation for Member States to ensure that public bodies and independent operators providing transport services under concession or permission from a public body allocate a quota of 25% of their total annual purchasing or leasing of vehicles with a weight greater than 3.5 t to clean vehicles.
Article 4 provides for the definition of clean vehicles in Article 2, point (b) and the quota established in Article 3 to be adapted to take account of technological developments, following changes to the definitions of clean vehicles.
Article 5 concerns the creation of a regulatory committee and its rules of operation.
Article 6 creates obligations for Member States to report on the procurement and the stock of clean vehicles and for the Commission to compile and publish this information, and to assess the implementation of the Directive as well as actions taken by Member States to promote the purchase and lease of environmentally friendly vehicles of less than 3.5 t and propose possible further actions including an extension of the Directive to cover other categories of vehicle.
Articles 7, 8 and 9 are the normal provisions relating to the entry into force and transposition of the Directive. | E-22403 | 1. 2005/0283 (COD) Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the promotion of clean road transport vehicles THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[2], Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[3], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[4], Whereas: (1) Natural resources and their prudent and rational utilisation as referred to in Article 174(1) of the EC Treaty, include oil, which ranks first in the European energy consumption but is also a major source of pollutant emissions. (2) Commission Communication entitled "A sustainable Europe for a Better World: a European Union strategy for Sustainable Development"[5], presented to the Gothenburg European Council of 15 and 16 June 2001, identified greenhouse gas emissions and pollution caused by transport among the main obstacles to sustainable development. (3) Commission Green Paper “Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply”[6] stressed the large potential for energy saving in the transport sector and the need for urgent action in the area.
The White Paper concluded that measures taken to date to reduce motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions and European energy dependency had proved inadequate. (5) Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme[7] acknowledges the need for specific measures to enhance energy-efficiency and energy saving, the integration of climate change objectives into transport and energy policies as well as the need for specific measures in the transport sector to address energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. (6) Commission Green Paper on Energy Efficiency or Doing More With Less[8] proposed specific measures to improve energy efficiency in transport and suggested as a concrete action the public procurement of less-polluting and more energy-efficient vehicles in order to build up a market for these types of vehicles. (7) The Community has committed itself to an 8% reduction in CO2 emissions between 1990 and 2008-2012 under the Kyoto Protocol.
However the possibility of amending this definition to take into account the latest technical progress should be provided for. (9) Vehicles with low fuel consumption or using alternative fuels, including biofuels, natural gas, LPG or hydrogen, and different technologies, including electrical or combustion/electrical hybrid systems, can contribute to a reduction of emissions and pollution. (10) Mandatory procurement of clean vehicles should contribute to reduce pollution and energy consumption and favour a faster market introduction of these vehicle technologies. (11) This Directive does not prevent Member States from also promoting the procurement of vehicles with enhanced environmental performance in the categories below 3.5 t weight, by giving preference to the latest Euro pollutant emission standards according to Directive 70/220/EEC and, in the category of passenger cars, to vehicles with CO2 emissions of less than 120 g/km, taking into account all vehicle technologies including those based on gasoline and diesel as well as alternative fuels and technologies, such as biofuels, natural gas, LPG, hydrogen, and electrical or combustion/electrical hybrid systems. (12) Obligations to purchase or lease vehicles should be applied in a similar way to all providers of public transport services. (13) Clean vehicles have a higher purchase price than conventional ones as the market for these types of vehicles is not well developed.
Article 3 Promotion of clean vehicles Member States shall ensure that a quota of 25% of the road transport vehicles with a technically permissible maximum laden weight of more than 3.5 t, which are purchased or leased in a given year by public bodies and operators providing transport services under concession or permission from a public body, herein referred to as operators, are clean vehicles as defined in Article 2.
Article 4 Adaptations to technical progress 1.
The quota of clean vehicles established in Article 3 may be increased in view of technical progress and to take account of developments in the vehicles market in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 5(2).
Article 8 Entry into force This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
Article 9 Addressees This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
