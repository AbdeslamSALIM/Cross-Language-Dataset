This position was reiterated at a meeting with the Italian authorities held on 25 January 2005, during which it was finally confirmed that the latter would inform the Commission when transmission of the control programmes could be considered complete. (19) By letter dated 26 January 2005, registered on 27 January 2005, the Italian Permanent Representation to the European Union sent the Commission a letter from the Italian authorities to which the tristeza control programme for Calabria was annexed. (20) By letter dated 14 February 2005, registered on 15 February 2005, the Italian Permanent Representation to the European Union sent the Commission a letter from the Italian authorities requesting a decision on the measures planned under the tristeza control programmes for Calabria, Campania and Basilicata. (21) By letter dated 28 February 2005, registered on 1 March 2005, the Italian Permanent Representation to the European Union sent the Commission a letter from the Italian authorities to which the tristeza control programme for Sicily was annexed. (22) In the course of March 2005, despite what had been agreed at the meeting on 25 January 2005, the Italian authorities repeatedly requested a separate decision on the tristeza control programme submitted by Calabria. (23) The Commission decided to divide file N 580/03 once more and for one last time to create a part C relating to the tristeza control programme submitted by Calabria.
At the same time, by letter dated 5 April 2005, it sent a new request for further information on the remainder of part B of the file, in other words the funding of the tristeza control measures provided for in the programmes for Campania, Basilicata and Sicily. (24) By letter dated 13 May 2005, registered on 18 May 2005, the Italian Permanent Representation to the European Union sent the Commission the additional information which the Italian authorities had been requested to provide in the letter dated 5 April 2005, but only for the programmes in Campania and Basilicata. (25) By letter dated 10 June 2005, registered on 17 June 2005, the Italian Permanent Representation to the European Union sent the Commission the additional information requested in connection with the programme for Sicily in the letter dated 5 April 2005 referred to above. (26) By letter dated 22 July 2005 [4], the Commission informed Italy of its decision not to raise any objections to the Campania and Basilicata tristeza control programmes and the prevention and technical assistance measures provided for in the tristeza control programme for Sicily, and to initiate the procedure under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the research funding provided for in that tristeza control programme. (27) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union [5].
