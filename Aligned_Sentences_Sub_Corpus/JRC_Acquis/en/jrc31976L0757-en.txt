Appendix EXAMPLE OF EEC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL MARK %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0009349%quot%%gt% The reflex reflector bearing the EEC component type-approval mark shown above is a Class I reflector EEC type-approved in the Netherlands (4) under the number 216. (ANNEX IV) ANNEX V TEST PROCEDURE V.1.
After verification of the general specifications (section 6 of Annex 0) and the specifications of shape and dimensions (Annex VI), the 10 samples shall be examined as to their colorimetric characteristics (Annex VII) and CIL (Annex VIII) for an angle of divergence of 20' and an illumination angle V = H = 0º or if necessary, in the position defined in VIII.4 and VIII.4.1.
a colour which satisfies the conditions laid down in Annex VII.
a CIL which satisfies the conditions laid down in Annex VIII and after the test reaches at least 60 % of the value previously obtained with the same sample.
The test shall be made only with an angle of divergence of 20' and an illumination angle of V = H = 0º or, if necessary, in the position defined in VIII.4 and VIII.4.1.
ANNEX VI SPECIFICATIONS OF SHAPE AND DIMENSIONS VI.1.
SHAPE AND DIMENSIONS OF REFLEX REFLECTORS IN CLASS I 1.1.
The illuminating surfaces of reflex reflectors in Class I must be capable of being inscribed within a circle 200 mm in diameter. 1.2.
The shape of the illuminating surfaces must be simple and not easily confused with a letter, figure or triangle at normal observation distances. 1.3.
As an exception to 1.2, a shape resembling the simply formed letters or figures 0, I, U or 8 is permissible.
SHAPE AND DIMENSIONS OF REFLEX REFLECTORS IN CLASS III 2.1.
The illuminating surfaces of reflex reflectors in Class III must have the shape of an equilateral triangle.
The illuminating surface may or may not be continuous.
In any case, the shortest distance between two adjacent reflex reflecting optical units must not exceed 15 mm. 2.4.
The illuminating surface of a reflex reflector shall be considered to be continuous if the edges of the illuminating surfaces of adjacent separate optical units are parallel and if the said optical units are evenly distributed over the whole solid surface of the triangle. 2.5.
The separate reflex reflecting optical units must not be replaceable unless they consist of approved reflex reflectors in Class I. 2.6.
The outside edges of the illuminating surfaces of triangular reflex reflectors in Class III must be between 150 and 200 mm long.
In the case of hollow-type devices, the minimum width of the sides, measured at right angles to them, shall be at least 20 % of the effective length between the extremities of the illuminating surfaces.
Appendix REFLEX REFLECTORS FOR TRAILERS - CLASS III %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0009350%quot%%gt% ANNEX VII COLORIMETRIC SPECIFICATIONS VII.1.
When the reflex reflector is illuminated by CIE standard illuminant A, with an angle of divergence of 20' and an illumination angle V = H = 0º, or, if this produces a colourless surface reflection, an angle V = ± 5º, H = 0º, the trichromatic coordinates of the reflected luminous flux must be within the following limits: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0009351%quot%%gt% 2.1.
ANNEX VIII PHOTOMETRIC SPECIFICATIONS VIII.1.
This corresponds to the illumination angle V = H = 0º in the table of coefficients of luminous intensity (CIL).
The CIL values for red reflex reflectors must be not less than those in the table below expressed in millicandelas per lux, for the angles of divergence and illumination shown: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0009352%quot%%gt% CIL values lower than those shown in the last two columns of the above table are not permissible within the solid angle having the reference centre as its apex and bounded by the planes intersecting along the following lines: (V = + and - 10º, H = 0º) (V = + and - 5º, H = + and - 20º) VIII.4.
When the CIL of a reflex reflector is measured for an angle ß of V = H = 0º, it shall be ascertained whether any mirror effect is produced by slightly turning the device.
If there is any such effect, a reading shall be taken with an angle ß of V = between - 5 and + 5, H = 0º.
The position adopted shall be that corresponding to the minimum CIL for one of these positions. %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0009495%quot%%gt% 4.2.
With an illumination angle ß of V = H = 0º, or the angle specified in VIII.4, and an angle of divergence of 20', reflex reflectors marked %quot%TOP%quot% shall be rotated between - 5 and + 5º about their axis of reference.
The CIL must not fall below the prescribed value in any position assumed by the device during this rotation. %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0009496%quot%%gt% VIII.5.
ANNEX IX RESISTANCE TO EXTERNAL AGENTS IX.1.
RESISTANCE TO PENETRATION OF WATER Reflex reflectors, whether or not grouped or reciprocally incorporated with a lamp, shall be stripped of all removable parts and immersed for 10 minutes in water at a temperature of 25 ± 5 ºC, the highest point of the upper part of the illuminating surface being about 20 mm below the surface of the water.
This test shall be repeated after turning the reflex reflector through 180º, so that the illuminating surface is at the bottom and the reverse side covered by about 20 mm of water. 1.1.
If inspection does not reveal the presence of water, or in case of doubt, the CIL shall be measured by the method described in V.3.2 after lightly shaking the reflex reflecting device to remove excess water from the outside.
The saline mist shall be produced by atomizing, at a temperature of 35 ± 2 ºC, a saline solution obtained by dissolving 20 + 2 parts by weight of sodium chloride in 80 parts of distilled water containing not more than 0 702 % of impurities.
RESISTANCE TO MOTOR FUELS The outer surface of the reflex reflector and, in particular, of the illuminating surface, shall be lightly wiped with a cotton cloth soaked in a mixture of petrol and benzol (proportion 90 : 10).
RESISTANCE TO LUBRICATING OILS The outer surface of the reflex reflector and, in particular, the illuminating surface, shall be lightly wiped with a cotton cloth soaked in a detergent lubricating oil.
