ANNEX LIST OF SIMULANTS 1 .
Where no %quot% X %quot% appears , no migration test is required for the heading or subheading concerned . 3 .
In the case of certain types of fatty foodstuffs this figure , known as the %quot% reduction factor %quot% , is conventionally used to take account of the greater extractive capacity of the simulant for such foodstuffs . 4 .
Where the letter %quot% a %quot% is shown in brackets after the %quot% X %quot% , only one of the two simulants given should be used : - if the pH value of the foodstuff is higher than 4,5 , simulant A should be used , - if the pH value of the foodstuff is 4,5 , or less , simulant B should be used . 5 .
Where a foodstuff is listed under both a specific and a general heading , only the simulant(s) indicated under the specific heading is ( are ) to be used .
