These points were reinforced in the March 2005 Communication entitled “Better regulation for growth and jobs in the European Union”[5].
Since then, the Commission has, in line with its revised Action Plan of March 2005: - endorsed revised impact assessment guidelines[6]; - adopted a Communication on an EU common methodology for assessing administrative costs imposed by legislation[7]; - adopted a Communication on the outcome of the screening of pending legislative proposals[8]; - adopted a Communication on a strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment[9]. - launched the group of high-level national regulatory experts[10].
Consultation of interested parties In 2005, the number of consultations increased significantly, with 187 non-legislative Communications (+28 compared to 2004) and 106 internet-based consultations (+11) via the web portal “Your Voice in Europe”.
Collection and use of expertise 2005 saw the operational launch of SINAPSE (Scientific INformAtion for Policy Support in Europe), a new and powerful interface between experts and (EU) policy makers[15].
More than 300 European and international scientific organisations registered in 2005.
Updating and simplifying the acquis In October 2005, the Commission adopted a new phase of its strategy for simplification of existing rules[18], which continues and reinforces the first comprehensive simplification programme launched in February 2003[19].
Screening and withdrawal of pending proposals The revised Action Plan of March 2005 provided for screening of pending proposals, with regard to their general relevance and their impact on competitiveness[26].
Pending proposals transmitted to the legislator before 1 January 2004 were all screened (183 proposals).
In September 2005, the Commission announced its intention to withdraw 68 proposals[27].
After having given Parliament and the Council time to express their views and having examined their comments, the Commission formally withdrew its proposals by publishing their list in 2006 in the Official Journal. 1.2.
Actions taken by the European Parliament, the Council, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee In 2005, the European Parliament started working on several reports looking at various aspects of better regulation, most being due for adoption in 2006.
The Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee also took an active part in the better regulation debate.
A noteworthy development was the agreement in November 2005 of an Inter-Institutional ‘Common Approach to Impact Assessment’, setting out some basic ‘traffic rules’ for impact assessment throughout the legislative process.
The Commission calls in particular on Member States which do not have a better regulation strategy, to assess the impact of proposed legislation, to systematically consult stakeholders, to set up a legislation simplification programme and to develop a methodology for the measurement of administrative costs. 2.
For its part, COSAC[35] organised a pilot project to test the subsidiarity early warning mechanism, provided for in the Constitutional Treaty, on a package of proposals made by the Commission in 2004.
Finally, future institutional arrangements for the monitoring and control of the application of subsidiarity were discussed as part of the “period for reflection, clarification and discussion” called for by the European Council on 16 June 2005, after the negative results of the French and Dutch referenda on the Constitutional Treaty.
This Communication updates and completes the Action Plan set in 2002 (“Simplifying and improving the regulatory environment”, COM(2002) 278, 5 June 2002).
The action plan follows up the White Paper on European Governance (COM(2001) 727, 25 June 2001). [3] OJ C 321, 31 December 2003, p.1. [4] COM(2005) 24. [5] COM(2005) 97. [6] SEC(2005) 791.
