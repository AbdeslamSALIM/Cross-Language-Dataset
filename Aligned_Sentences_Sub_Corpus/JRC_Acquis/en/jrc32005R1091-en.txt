Following that request, EFSA issued two separate opinions on those issues on 21 October 2004. (5) In its opinion on the use of antimicrobials for the control of salmonella in poultry, EFSA recommended that the use of antimicrobials should be discouraged due to public health risks associated with development, selection and spread of resistance.
Antimicrobials shall not be used as a specific method to control salmonella in breeding flocks of Gallus gallus in the framework of national control programmes adopted pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003, except in the circumstances established in paragraph 2. 2.
Article 2 Use of vaccines Live salmonella vaccines for which the manufacturer does not provide an appropriate method to distinguish bacteriologically wild-type strains of salmonella from vaccine strains shall not be used in the framework of national control programmes adopted pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003.
Article 3 Entry into force This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from 1 January 2007.
