By a letter dated 9 December 2005 the Swedish authorities applied to the Commission for an extension of the authorisation until 31 December 2011.
At about the same time, namely by letter dated 15 November 2005, the Swedish authorities notified the Commission according to Article 88(3) of the Treaty prolongation of the regionally differentiated energy tax for the service sector[4].
Sweden justifies its request for authorisation under Article 19 of Council Directive 2003/96/EC for specific regional policy objectives.
The annual budgetary expenditure related to the tax reduction is anticipated to be SEK 146 million (16 million euros).
The measure is to be terminated by 31 December 2011. | 130 | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity.
Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC provides that measures adopted under its provisions must be limited in time, and sets a maximum period of 6 years, with a possibility of renewal.
The present evaluation is without prejudice to the outcome of the state aid case N 593/2005. | CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | Consultation of interested parties | 219 | The proposal contains a prolongation of an existing derogation, which only concerns Sweden. | Collection and use of expertise | 229 | There was no need for external expertise. | 230 | Impact assessment Non applicable. | LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | 305 | Summary of the proposed action On the basis of the above and without prejudice to the outcome of the sate aid case N 593/2005, Commission proposes to extend the validity of Council Decision 2005/231/EC until 31 December 2011 authorising thereby Sweden to apply a reduced rate of taxation on electricity consumed by households and service sector companies in the North of Sweden. | 310 | Legal basis Article 19 of Council Directive 2003/96/EC. | 320 | Subsidiarity principle The subsidiarity principle applies insofar as the proposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the Community. | The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States for the following reason(s). | 321 | With Council Directive 2003/96/EC the EU laid down harmonized provisions for taxation of energy products and electricity.
By Council Decision 2005/231/EC[7] Sweden was authorised to apply a reduced rate of taxation to electricity consumed by certain households and service sector companies in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC.
By letter dated 9 December 2005, the Swedish authorities applied to the Commission for an extension of the authorisation, until the end of 2011. 3.
The percentage of the reduction as compared to the normal rate has however declined since that time. 4.
Without prejudice to the outcome of the state aid case N 593/2005 Sweden "Prolongation of service sector's regionally differentiated energy tax on electricity", it is therefore appropriate to renew, in accordance with the terms of Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC, the authorisation for Sweden to apply a reduced rate of taxation to electricity for consumption in the north of Sweden, until 31 December 2011. 8.

Article 3 This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Sweden.
