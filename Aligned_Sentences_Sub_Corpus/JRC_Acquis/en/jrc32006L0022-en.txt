In terms of checks, the percentage of days worked by drivers of vehicles falling within the scope of the social legislation that are checked should therefore be gradually increased to 4 %. (7) As regards checking systems, the aim must be that national systems develop towards European interoperability and practicability. (8) Sufficient standard equipment and appropriate legal powers should be available to all enforcement units to enable them to carry out their duties effectively and efficiently. (9) Member States should seek to ensure, without prejudice to the proper execution of the tasks imposed by this Directive, that roadside checks are executed efficiently and quickly, with a view to completing the check in the shortest time possible and with the least delay for the driver. (10) Within each Member State there should be a single body for intracommunity liaison with other relevant competent authorities.
In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (15) Council Directive 88/599/EEC [8] on standard checking procedures for the implementation of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85should therefore be repealed, HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: Article 1 Subject-matter This Directive lays down minimum conditions for the implementation of Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85.
