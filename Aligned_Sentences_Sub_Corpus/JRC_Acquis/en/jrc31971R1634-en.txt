and which in addition meet the following requirements: regularity of the grains: (a) 75 % of the grains must not exceed 20 % of the dm; (b) 94 % of the grains added progressively between 3 % and 97 % must not exceed 30 % of the dm; (c) 100 % of the grains must not exceed 50 % of the dm; Determination of regularity by sieve analysis using sieves with round holes.
dm : the median value obtained from the graph of the results of sieve analysis at the point at which 50 % of the product has passed through the sieve.
Second class grains: grains which correspond to the definition under B I (1).
