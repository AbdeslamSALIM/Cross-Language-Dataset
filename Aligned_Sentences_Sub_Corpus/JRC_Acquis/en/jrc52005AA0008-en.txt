Administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax 29-32 V.
Administrative cooperation to combat money laundering 33-39 VI.
Based on Article 280 and other provisions of the Treaty, there is a common set of legal rules to be enacted for all areas.
Such "particular relevance at Community level" is defined by two criteria: (a) The irregular transaction must have ramifications or links to operations in more than one Member State and (b) the irregular transaction is estimated to cause damage of 100000 euro or more to the Community or to cause fiscal damage in the area of VAT in the Member States concerned in excess of 500000 euro. 6.
In its Annual Report for 2001 [18], the Court drew attention to the increasing problems of carousel fraud and to the need to address this problem through enhanced administrative cooperation in order to protect VAT revenue [19]. 21.
The Court notes that the provisions of the newly proposed regulation are to a large extent similar or even identical to those already contained in Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, notably with regard to exchanges of information and rules for administrative enquiries [22]. 24.
Comments made in paragraphs 17 to 19 of this opinion also apply to administrative cooperation in the field of VAT.
Pursuant to Article 19 of the guidelines for the quality of drafting of Community legislation [26], it would therefore be advisable to clarify the situation. 32.
Comments made in paragraphs 17 and 19 of this opinion are also relevant for administrative cooperation in combating money laundering.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 33.
