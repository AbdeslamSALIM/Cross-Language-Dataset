2006/861/EC: Commission Decision of 28%nbsp%July 2006 concerning the technical specification of interoperability relating to the subsystem rolling stock %mdash% freight wagons of the trans-European conventional rail system (notified under document number C(2006) 3345) Text with EEA relevance Commission Decision of 28 July 2006 concerning the technical specification of interoperability relating to the subsystem "rolling stock — freight wagons" of the trans-European conventional rail system (notified under document number C(2006) 3345) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/861/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Directive 2001/16/EC of 19 March 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the conventional rail system [1], and in particular Article 6(1) thereof, Whereas: (1) In accordance with Article 2(c) of Directive 2001/16/EC, the trans-European conventional rail system is subdivided into structural and functional subsystems. (2) In accordance with Article 23(1) of the Directive, the subsystem "rolling stock — freight wagons" needs to be covered by a technical specification for interoperability (TSI). (3) The first step in establishing a TSI is to have a draft TSI drawn up by the European Association for Railway Interoperability (AEIF) which was appointed as the joint representative body. (4) The AEIF has been given a mandate to draw up a draft TSI for the "rolling stock — freight wagons" subsystem in accordance with Article 6(1) of Directive 2001/16/EC.
For this latter purpose, Member States should apply, as far as possible, the principles and criteria provided for in Directive 2001/16/EC for the implementation of Article 16(2) in making use of the bodies notified under Article 20 of Directive 2001/16/EC.
The Commission should carry out an analysis of the information forwarded by the Member States, in the form of national rules, procedures, bodies in charge of implementing procedures, and duration of these procedures, and, where appropriate, should discuss with the Committee the need for the adoption of any measures. (11) The TSI in question should not demand the use of specific technologies or technical solutions except where this is strictly necessary for the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system. (12) The TSI is based on best available expert knowledge at the time of preparation of the relevant draft.
The TSI shall be as set out in the Annex to this Decision.
With regard to those issues classified as "Open points" set out in Annex JJ of the TSI, the conditions to be complied with for the verification of the interoperability pursuant to Article 16(2) of Directive 2001/16/EC shall be those applicable technical rules in use in the Member State which authorise the putting into service of the subsystem covered by this Decision. 2.
Article 4 Those provisions of Decision 2004/446/EC which concern the basic parameters of the trans-European conventional rail system shall no longer apply as from the date on which this Decision becomes applicable.

CHARACTERISATION OF THE SUBSYSTEM 4.1.
The functional and technical specifications of the subsystem and its interfaces, described in sections 4.2 and 4.3, do not impose the use of specific technologies or technical solutions, except where this is strictly necessary for the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail network.
But innovative solutions for interoperability may require new specifications and/or new assessment methods.
In order to allow technological innovation, these specifications and assessment methods shall be developed by the process described in sections 6.1.2.3 and 6.2.2.2.

BRAKING 4.2.4.1.
Braking performance 4.2.4.1.1.
General The purpose of the train braking system is to ensure that the train's speed can be reduced or it can be stopped within the maximum allowable braking distance.
Braking performance of a train or a vehicle is the result of the braking power available to retard the train within defined limits and all factors involved in the conversion and dissipation of energy including train resistance.
Braking performance shall be determined by both deceleration profiles and by braked mass percentage.
Deceleration profile: The deceleration profile describes the predicted instantaneous deceleration of the vehicle (at the level of a vehicle) or the train (at the level of a train) in normal conditions.
Knowledge of individual vehicle deceleration profiles enables the calculation of the overall train deceleration profile.
The deceleration profile includes the effect of: a) the response time between brake demand and reaching full brake effort. +++++ TIFF +++++ Te is the equivalent build-up application time and is defined as: Te = t1 + (t2/2) For pneumatic brake the end of the time t2 corresponds to 95 % of established brake cylinder pressure.
b) the corresponding function (deceleration = F(speed)) as defined as a succession of sections with a constant deceleration. +++++ TIFF +++++ Note: a denotes the instantaneous deceleration and V the instantaneous speed Brake mass percentage: The brake mass percentage (lambda) is the ratio of the sum of the brake masses divided by the sum of the masses of the vehicles.
P braking mode: brake mode for freight trains with specified brake application time and brake release time and specified brake mass percentage.
R braking mode: brake mode for passenger trains and fast freight trains with specified brake application time and brake release time as for braking mode P and specified minimum brake mass percentage.
The minimum braking performance for brake-modes G and P: shall be in accordance with the following table: Braking Mode — Te range (s) | Wagon Type | Command Equipment | Load | Requirement for running speed at 100km/h | Requirement for running speed at 120km/h | | | | | Maxi | Mini | Maxi | Mini | Braking mode "P" -1,5 ≤Te ≤ 3 s | All | All | EMPTY | S = 480m λ = 100 % [1] γ = 0,91 m/s2 [1] | Case A — composite blocks: S = 390 m, λ = 125 %, γ = 1,15 m/s2 Case B — other cases: S = 380 m, λ = 130 %, γ = 1,18 m/s2 | S = 700 m λ = 100 % γ = 0,88 m/s2 | Case A — composite blocks: S = 580 m, λ = 125 %, γ = 1,08 m/s2 Case B — other cases: S = 560 m, λ = 130 %, γ = 1,13 m/s2 | | "S1" [2] | Empty/ Load Device | Intermediate Load | S = 810 m λ = 55 % γ = 0,51m/s2 | Case A — composite blocks: S = 390 m, λ = 125 %, γ = 1,15 m/s2 Case B — other cases: S = 380 m, λ = 130 %, γ= 1,18 m/s2 | | | | | | LOADED (Maximum = 22,5 t/axle) | S = 700 m λ = 65 % γ = 0,60 m/s2 | Case A — Brake only on wheels (Brake blocks): S = greater of (S = 480 m, λ = 100 %, γ = 0,91 m/s2) or (S obtained with a mean retardation force of 16,5 kN per axle [5] .

The test conditions applicable for bogies running on standard gauge track under normal conditions of speed and track quality are defined in Annex J.
Such tests shall be drawn up case by case, using the tests defined above as a guide.
This remark also applies to the case of bogie frames intended for service on track with a different gauge, or under clearly different operating conditions, or bogies with a novel design.
The three tests described in Annex J Sections J1, J2 and J3 have been defined in order to: - optimise the construction of the bogie frame (weight, speed) - supplement the information obtained from calculations - ensure that the bogie frames are suitable for withstanding the in-service loads without the occurrence of permanent deformation or cracks that would reduce safety or result in high maintenance costs.
The tests in Annex J section J1 are considered to represent the maximum loads that can occur in service, without taking the loads due to accidents into account.
The tests in Annex J sections J2 and J3 are considered to represent, on average, the aggregate total of variable loads occurring during the bogie service life.
The number of cycles in the fatigue test was selected to simulate an overall service life of 30 years at a rate of 100000 km per year.
The distribution of these cycles over three distinct load stages was done with a view to optimising bogie frame structures.
To ensure the validity of the tests defined in Annex J sections J1, J2 and J3, particular attention shall be paid to their practical implementation.
In particular: - For the static tests of Annex J sections J1 and J2, the bogie frames shall be equipped with uni-directional strain gauges in those locations where stresses occur with a single clearly defined direction; in all other locations tri-directional strain gauges (rosettes) shall be used.
The bogie frames used for the three tests shall be complete, and equipped with all their connecting elements (for dampers, brakes, etc.).
Wheelsets The assessment of the wheelset is described in Annex K. 6.1.3.2.3.

As far as specified in this TSI, the EC verification of the Conventional Rail Rolling Stock Subsystem shall take into account its interfaces with other subsystems of the Conventional Rail System.
The contracting entity shall draw up the EC declaration of verification for the Rolling Stock Subsystem in accordance with Article 18 (1) and Annex V of Directive 2001/16/EC. 6.2.2.
General The Modules to choose for the verification procedures are defined in Annex AA.
For the verification procedure of the requirements of Freight wagons, as specified in section 4, the contracting entity or its authorised representative established within the Community may chose the following modules: a) the Type Examination procedure (module SB) for the design and development phase, in combination with a module for the production phase either: - the Production Quality Management System procedure (module SD), - or the Product Verification (module SF); or b) the Full quality Management System with Design Examination procedure (module SH2).
The module SD may only be chosen where the contracting entity, or the main contractors when involved, operate a quality management system for manufacture, final production inspection and testing, approved and surveyed by a Notified Body of his/their choice.
The following additional requirements shall be taken into account for the use of the modules: - Module SB: with reference to section 4.3 of the module, a design review is requested, - For the production phase, modules SD, SF and SH2: the application of these Modules shall enable the conformity of the wagons with the approved type as described in the type examination certificate.

List of notations used A : angular displacement coefficient of bogie a :distance between the end axles of vehicles not fitted with bogies or between the pivots of bogie vehicles (see Note) b : half width of the vehicle (see diagram in Appendix 2) b1 : half distance between the primary suspension springs (see diagram in Appendix 2) b2 : half distance between the secondary suspension springs (see diagram in Appendix 2) bG : half distance between the side-bearers bw : half width of the pantograph bow C : roll centre (see Figure 3) d : the outer distance between the wheel flanges measured at a point 10 millimetres below the running treads, with the flanges worn to the permissible limit, the absolute limit being 1,410 m.
Normal co-ordinates The expression "normal co-ordinates" is used for orthogonal axes defined in a plane normal to the centreline of the track in nominal position; one of these axes, sometimes called horizontal, is the intersection of the specified plane and the running surface; the other is the perpendicular to this intersection at equal distance from the rails.
For calculation purposes, this centreline and the vehicle centreline must be considered as coincident in order to be able to compare the vehicle construction gauges and the lineside structure limit gauges, both calculated on the basis of the kinematic gauge reference profile which is common to both.
C3) Whenever a stationary vehicle is placed on a canted track whose running surface lies at an angle δ to the horizontal, its body leans on its suspensions and forms an angle η with the perpendicular to the rail level.
The vehicle flexibility coefficient s is defined by the ratio: This ratio may be calculated or measured (see UIC Leaflet 505-5).
Maximum construction gauge for rolling stock The maximum construction gauge is the maximum profile, obtained by applying the rules giving reductions in relation to the reference profile, which the various parts of the rolling stock must respect.
Quasi-static movements z "z" is the part of lateral movements attributable to the rolling stock (when there is a 50 mm cant deficiency) and resulting from the technology and flexibility of the suspensions (flexibility coefficient s), under the effect of centrifugal force not compensated for by cant or of excessive cant (see Figure 3a or 3b) and under the effect of asymmetry ηo (see Figure 3c).
Ei or Ea reductions To ensure that a vehicle when on the track does not exceed the "vehicle limit position" in view of its D movements, the half-width dimensions must be subject to an Ei or Ea reduction, in relation to the reference profile, such that: Ei or Ea ≥ D — So.
The following distinction is made: — Ei : reduction value for the reference profile half-width dimensions for the sections located between the end axles of vehicles not mounted on bogies or between the pivots of vehicles mounted on bogies — Ea : reduction value for the reference profile half-width dimensions for the sections beyond the end axles of vehicles not mounted on bogies or the pivots of vehicles mounted on bogies.
It is of course necessary to check all the projecting points, as well as those which, in view of their location, are likely to be in close proximity to the vehicle construction maximum gauge within the section under consideration.
Transversally, taking into account the vehicle body movements obtained for a point located on an ni or na section at height h in relation to the running surface, the half-widths of the maximum vehicle construction gauge shall be at the most equal to the corresponding half-widths of the reference profile, specific to each type of vehicle, decreased by the Ei or Ea reductions.
These reductions must satisfy the relationship Ei or Ea ≥ D — So in which: - D represents the movements whose values are calculated by the formulae given in Para. 1.4.2. - So represents the maximum projections, the values of which are shown in Para. 2.3 "Permitted projections".
Vertical movements For the vehicle or for a given part, these movements make it possible to determine a minimum height and a maximum height above the running surface; this is particularly the case for: - parts located towards the lower section of the gauge (low parts); - the step at 1170 mm from the running surface on the reference profile; - parts located at the upper part of the vehicles.
C6 +++++ TIFF +++++ Sags independent of the load state and of the suspension state These deflections shall be considered for all vehicle body zones A, B, C and D, and concern the following parts: — Wheels : maximum wear for all types of vehicles — Various parts : maximum wear — Examples: side-bearers, brake rigging, etc, for all vehicles and for each special assembly — Axle boxes : wear ignored — Bogie frame : manufacturing tolerances giving rise to deflection in relation to the nominal dimensions: ignored — Body structures : manufacturing tolerances giving rise to deflection in relation to the nominal dimensions: ignored for all vehicles including all conventional and special wagons.
a) Vehicles with a reference profile (part below 130 mm) in accordance with paragraph C.3.2.3 Normal values for the ei or ea vertical reductions to be taken into account for empty coaches, empty or loaded vans and wagons.
These vehicles, when they can be gravity shunted, must be capable of passing over activated rail brakes and other shunting or stopping devices located on non-vertically curved track and reaching the 115 and 125 mm dimensions above the running surface, up to 3 m from the end of convex transition curves of radius Rv ≥ 250 m (dimension d).
They must also be able to pass over such devices located inside or near concave transitions curves of radius Rv ≥ 300 m.
In applying these conditions, the lower dimensions of these vehicles, taking into account vertical movements, assessed as stated in paragraph § 1.4.1, must in relation to the running surface be at least equal to 115 or 125 mm increased by the following ei or ea quantities: Fig.C7 +++++ TIFF +++++ ei or ea : vertical reduction at the lower part of the rolling stock equipment in relation to the 115 or 125 mm dimensions.
ev : lowering of the rail brakes in relation to the 115 or 125 mm dimensions.
These reduced values are only tolerated for certain types of wagon, insofar as they require a larger space than that determined using the normal values.

c) All vehicles All vehicles must be able to pass over convex or concave transition curves of radius Rv ≥ 500 m, without any part other than the wheel flange descending below the running surface.
Lateral movements (D) These movements are the sum of the following movements: - geometric movements resulting from the vehicle running through curves and straight track (projections, lateral play, etc.), where the vehicle centreline is considered to be perpendicular to the running surface; - quasi-static movements resulting from the inclination of the suspended parts under the influence of gravity (canted track) and/or centrifugal acceleration (curved track). - lateral sag of the vehicle body is generally disregarded except for those special types of wagon or heavily-laden wagons for which these values are particularly high.
It is therefore necessary to consider the various positions which the vehicle may take up on the track so as to take into account any displacement factor A to be applied to certain terms in the fundamental formulae used for calculating the Ei internal and Ea external reductions.
The displacement factor and the vehicle running position on the track are given in the table below.
The Rolling Stock Department shall determine Ei and Ea taking into account: - a cant excess or deficiency of 0,05 m; - where appropriate a cant excess or deficiency of 0,2 m, when the respective values of s and hc lead to the gauge defined by the Way and Works Department being exceeded (see figure below and paragraph 1.5.1.3). - of the influence, beyond 1o, of the asymmetry resulting from design and adjustment (1) tolerances (side-bearers play) and from any unevenness in the distribution of the normal load.

xi and xa are special terms for the calculation for vehicles with very large wheelbase.
If the value of w varies with the curve radius: - wi(R) means that w is considered for radius R and the inside of the curve; - wa(R) means that w is considered for radius R and the outside of the curve; - w∞ means that w is considered for straight track.
It can also be equal to the sum of some of these notations: wi + wa, etc, each of these terms being potentially influenced by the corresponding displacement factor.
For sprung parts located at height h, the above terms give, in the formulae, a value of: a) Special cases when | { | h%gt%hc and 0,5ms≤0,4η0≤1o | } | z=s30h-hc | when | { | h%lt%0,5 mη0≤1oand for any value of hc and s | } | z=4s30hc-h | when h = hc | | | | z = 0 | For unsprung parts z = 0.
b) Influence of side-bearers play for wagons fitted with bogies - For wagons fitted with bogies whose side-bearers play is less than or equal to 5 mm, the 1o angle of asymmetry is considered to cover this play and the formula η0 = 1o is conventionally used.
The term "z" taking into account side-bearers play less than or equal to 5 mm is given as: z=s30h-hc+s10h-hc-0,04h-0,5%gt%0%gt%0 and account must be taken of the special cases described above. - For wagons fitted with bogies whose side-bearers play is greater than 5 mm, account should be taken of the additional inclination α of the vehicle body, expressed as follows: α=arctanJ-0,005bG This additional inclination α leads to compression of the suspension which, when multiplied by the coefficient of flexibility s, is given as a rotation of the vehicle body: αs (where s is the coefficient of flexibility).
The total additional inclination may be expressed as: α (1 + s) The term z taking account of side-bearers play greater than 5 mm becomes: z=s30+tanη'0+arctan J-0,005%gt%0bG1+s-1o%gt%0h-hc+s10h-hc-0,04h-0,5%gt%0%gt%0 Note: %gt%0 means that the expression between the square brackets should be taken as its own value if that value is positive or as 0 if that value is negative or null. η’0 = asymmetry in the case of 5 mm side-bearers play.

It is divided into 2 parts as follows, one being above and the other below the 400 mm height that is also the limit for the calculation of projections: - an upper part defined as being above a plane located 400 mm above the running surface, common to all vehicles, - a lower part defined as being located at or below the plane located 400 mm above the running surface and which differs according to whether the vehicles must pass over shunting bumps, rail brakes and other activated shunting and stopping devices (part lower than 130 mm) or not.
The part below 130 mm differs according to vehicle type.
Loaded coaches must respect the provisions of paragraph C.3.2.2 when on a track without vertical curvature.
Wagons which must not pass over shunting humps with a curvature radius of 250 m or track brakes and other shunting and stopping devices: - shall not be allowed to carry the RIV sign, unless otherwise expressly specified in the standards - are required to bear the inscription to that effect.
Part below 130 mm on vehicles which must not pass over shunting humps or negotiate rail brakes and other activated shunting and stopping devices Certain gauge restrictions must be observed at right angles to the axles when vehicles are placed on an under-floor wheel lathe for wheel reprofiling.
This limit may however be disregarded for parts located between the wheels, provided these parts remain within the wheel track. 2) Maximum theoretical width of the flange profile in the case of check-rails. 3) Effective limit position of the outside surface of the wheel and of the parts associated with this wheel. 4) For parts located inside the bogies, this dimension is 150 mm. 5) Effective limit position of the internal surface of the wheel when the axle is against the opposite rail.

Carriage doors a) In opened position, carriage doors whose bottom-most part is at least 1050 mm above the rail-top, when the vehicle is in the lowest permissible position for the buffers, may project beyond the vehiclE's reduced clearance gauge by at most 200 mm.

Appendix 2 C.7.1.
Compression of the suspensions for areas outside the support polygon B, C and D 1.
Calculation of the loading gauge of tilting vehicles C.8.1.1.
The speed in curves of railway vehicles is restricted because of the lateral acceleration which acts on the passengers: this limit of uncompensated acceleration is of the order of 1 to 1,3 ms-2.
TBV units, in particular those fitted with active systems, can run with higher values of uncompensated acceleration (for example 1,82 ms-2 for the FIAT ETR 450 train, equivalent to a cant deficiency of 278 mm) because the tilting of the body enables the values of the lateral acceleration felt by the passengers to be reduced.
Symbols used The following additional symbols are used in this Appendix: IP = value of the cant deficiency considered for the TBV IC = value of the maximum cant deficiency permitted by the Permanent Way Department of the Railway [31] 1) E = value of the cant zP = quasi-static displacements determined according to the needs of the TBV units C.8.2.
Basic formulae Depending on the different types of TBV to be investigated (coaches, power cars or multiple unit motor coaches) the corresponding formulae for the G1 gauge shall be used, to which shall be added all the modifications presented in this Appendix.
Given this requirement, the following terms of the reduction formulae shall have to be reconsidered: a) Lateral plays: (1,465-d)/2, q and w [32] The sign of the lateral displacements, in general, should take account of the centrifugal effect.
The changes required are discussed in § 8.3.2.1.
b) Quasi-static displacements "z" The term z is valid provided that vehicles do not exceed, when running, the cant deficiency value IP = 200 mm.
As the vehicle is submitted to a very high centrifugal force towards the outside of the curve, the terms of the lateral displacements shall be reconsidered. - The play w shall be taken towards the outside of the curve. - For the plays (1,465 - d)/2 and q it is necessary to distinguish between bogie vehicles and vehicles with independent wheels.
Bogie vehicles, calculation of play on the outer side of the curve: The plays (1,465 - d)/2 and q shall be taken, likewise for reasons of safety, on the outside of the curve.
Vehicles with independent wheels: The tests have confirmed that the plays (1,465 - d)/2 and q occur towards the outside of the curve.
The quasi-static displacements of vehicles are calculated with the formula below: The maximum allowable value for E or I is 200 mm.
Because TBVs can run with cant deficiencies of up to Ip it is necessary to revise the calculation of this term (zP).
The following figures show this type of displacement from the position I = 0.
The value of this displacement in the calculation will have a minus sign. - The opposite is true for points situated at a height of h %gt% hc.
Similarly to Figures 2a and 2b, the Figures 3a and 3b represent this type of displacement, from the position I = 0.
The value of this displacement in the calculation will have a plus sign. - The opposite is true for the points situated at a height of h %lt% hc.
The value of this displacement in the calculation will have a plus sign. - The opposite is true for the points situated at a height of h %gt% hc.
Since the position of obstacles cannot be questioned, the reductions calculated for vehicles should, if necessary, be increased by a value corresponding to the difference between the quasi-static displacements due to IP and those taken into account by the Permanent Way Department or: Active system Passive system It must be remembered that: - the formulae apply where IP %gt% IC; - it will be necessary to find in the application phase corresponding to a real case, the combination of the values for IP and IC which give a value of zP that maximises the reduction: - the tilting system of the vehicle must ensure the following for the intermediate values of IP (marked IP'), to which correspond the intermediate values of cant deficiency Ic': Furthermore, the conditions given in 5.1 must be met.
This term is of the form: S1,5Ip-Ich-hc Moreover, no account shall be taken of the term tan β (h - h0) for these parts (see § 3.2.3). - This Appendix has been developed on the basis of information applicable to the TBV units in service today.
Comments C.8.5.1.
These values shall meet the following conditions in order that the bodies do not exceed the specified profile: a) The intermediate values I’P, I’C and E' between 0 and the maximum value of the respective sizes, shall meet, from a point of view of the regulation of the tilting system, the following condition: I'PIP=I'CIC=E'E b) Moreover in the case of checking on the outside of the curve, in view of the fact that the centrifugal force tilts the body towards the outside (quasi-static displacement zP), the following condition, regarding the value of β for the adjustment shall be observed: tan β (h - h0) ≥ zp In other words, the effect of the system must be greater than or equal to the quasi-static effect.
t1 = lateral movement of the track t2 = impact of a cant or cross-level defect of 0,015 m t3i, a = oscillations towards the inside or towards the outside t4 and t5 = impact of load imbalance and of asymmetries The following parameters shall be used to determine the margins (clearances) to be added to the G1 reference profile: h = 3,25 m hc = 0,5 m s = 0,4 The predefined parameters of the vehicle under examination can be used, for instance: h = 1,8 m (height above the running surface of a certain body section) hc = 0,7 m s = 0,24 Based on the above parameters, the following values can be obtained: for profile G1 | D = 0,113 m | for the vehicle with predefined parameters | D’ = 0,058 m | The difference D - D’ = 0,055 m can be used as a basis for widening a vehicle with predefined parameters.
Example: SNCF, V ≤ 120 km/h: DSNCF = 0,05 +0,03 = 0,08 m.
If c %lt% 2,40 m: the values given in D.4 shall be taken and the lesser of the dimensions a or c shall be taken as the value of a.

The pressure drop in the brake pipe to obtain a full application must be 1,5 bar ± 0,1.
The maximum output pressure obtained with this drop is 3,8 bar ± 0,1.
The Brake Application Time is the time for increasing output pressure from when it starts to rise from 0 bar up to 95 % of the maximum output pressure when input pressure is reduced to 0 bar in less than 2 seconds.
This is 3 to 5 seconds in "P" single stage, or 3 to 6 seconds in "P" with a load/empty or load proportional brake, and 18 to 30 seconds in "G" in a single-pipe operation.
The Insensitivity of the distributor is such that it will not come into operation with an input reduction from the normal operating pressure of 0,3 bar in 60 seconds.

The brake pipe emptying accelerator shall not come into operation when the pressure in the brake pipe falls uniformly from 5 to 3.2 bar over 6 seconds with the brake inoperative.
Vertical and Transverse Loads The vertical and transverse loads are calculated by reference to the nominal bogie load (for example: bogie for 20 t or 22,5 t on-rail axle load).
In order to take the maximum dynamic load into account: - The vertical load to be applied to the pivot bearing shall be: - Fz max. = 1,5 Fz, with Fz = 4Qo-m+g (for 2-axle bogies) - Fz max. = 1,5 Fz, with Fz = 6Qo-m+g (for 3-axle bogies) If only the vertical load due to bounce is to be simulated, a load of 2 Fz shall be applied to the pivot bearing only.
Loads due to roll The roll coefficient α is taken to be equal to 0,3 for a spacing between the friction pads of 1700 mm (standard 2-axle bogies).
If the spacing between the friction pads (2 bg) differs from 1700 mm, the value for α should be: α = 0,317002bg Loads Due To Braking The loads due to braking FB correspond to 120 % of the forces resulting from emergency braking.
The test shall be carried out in accordance with Figure 1 and Table J5 (for 2-axle bogies) or Figure 2 and Table J6 (for 3-axle bogies).
Loads with values corresponding to 50 % and 75 % of the maximum values shall be applied before applying the full load configuration.
They depend on: - Fz, the static load exerted by the wagon body on each bogie - α, the roll coefficient - β, the bounce coefficient The roll coefficient α is taken to be equal to 0,2 for a spacing between the friction pads of 1700 mm (standard 2-axle bogies).
If the spacing between the friction pads (2bg) differs from 1700 mm, the value for α should be: α = 0,217002bg The bounce coefficient β that represents the vertical dynamic behaviour of the bogie shall be taken to be equal to 0,3 (the normal value for wagon bogies).
Transverse load The transverse load shall be equal to: - Fy = 0,4 x 0,5 Fz + m+g (for 2-axle bogies) - Fy = 0,53 x 0,5 Fz + m+g (for 3-axle bogies) Loads Due To Braking The loads due to braking correspond to 100 % of the forces resulting from emergency braking.
For each of these four new load cases, the loads due to twist shall be applied first in one direction and then in the other.
Tests with application of loads corresponding to the loads due to braking shall be carried out if the results of the tests according to Appendix A show them to be necessary (elastic limit exceeded during those tests).

The loads due to the coefficient β are considered to be "dynamic".
The roll coefficient α is taken to be equal to 0,2 for a spacing between the friction pads of 1700 mm (standard two-axle bogies).
If the spacing between the friction pads (2bg) differs from 1700 mm, the value for α shall be: α = 0,217002bg Transverse Loads The transverse loads consist of two components: - Two-axle bogies: - quasi-static load: Fyq = 0,1 Fz + m+g - dynamic load: Fyq = 0,1 Fz + m+g - Three-axle bogies: - quasi-static load: Fyq = 0,133 Fz + m+g - dynamic load: Fyd = 0,133 Fz + m+g Loads Due To Braking The loads due to braking correspond to 100 % of the forces resulting from emergency braking.
Torsional Loads Track twist, referenced to the bogie wheelbase, shall be 5 ‰.
Test Procedure The fatigue tests consist of alternating quasi-static and dynamic load sequences that represent running through right and left-hand curves.
If the static tests defined in Appendix B have shown that the track twist induced stresses only in limited zones of the bogie frame, where the stresses caused by the vertical and transverse loads are minor, the fatigue test, as a first stage, shall be performed with only vertical and transverse loads.
In this case, the vertical and transverse quasi-static and dynamic loads shall vary with time as shown in the diagrams in Figures 3, 5, 6 and 7 (for two-axle bogies) or in Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 (for three-axle bogies).
The second test stage shall consist of 2 × 106 cycles, with the static forces unchanged and the quasi-static and dynamic forces multiplied by 1,2.
The third test stage shall also consist of 2 × 106 cycles and is performed as the second stage, but with the factor 1,2 replaced by 1,4.
Results To Be Obtained No cracks shall be found after application of the 6 × 106 cycles of the first test stage.
OVERVIEW/GUIDELINES The tests can be divided into three groups: - Static tests with exceptional in-service loads These tests verify that there is no risk of permanent and visible deformation of the bogie frame due to the superposition of the maximum loads that can occur in service. - Static tests to simulate normal in-service dynamic loads These tests verify that there is no risk of fatigue cracks occurring due to the superposition of in-service loads. - Fatigue tests The purpose of these tests is to determine the service life of the bogie frame, to detect potential hidden weak spots — in particular at locations where it is not possible to attach strain gauges, — and to assess the safety margin.
The range of the end fitting force, depends on the force F defined in K.2.1 and shall be: 0,85 F %lt% end fitting force %lt% 1,45 F K.2 WHEELSET CHARACTERISTICS.
A proving thrust F shall be gradually and uniformly applied around the wheel and sustained for a period of 30 seconds.

TESTS CONDITIONS R.1.1.
The slave wagon must be laden (20tons axle load) and the test wagon shall be empty. - Complete configuration By long two axles freight wagons with LoB ≥ 15,75 m is a special test in a three wagon train configuration necessary (test wagen and two slave wagons with the same geometrical parameters).
Buffer type The slave wagons must be fitted with category A non-pivoting buffers (590kN end-stroke force) which have already been used in revenue service.
The test train shall reverse back along an S-shaped curve at a speed of 4 to 8 km/h with a longitudinal compressive force that remains virtually constant.
Until 280 kN it will not reach any evaluation criteria and so does not need to be increased.
In order to determine the linear comparison, at least 20 tests shall be carried out for analysis, with different longitudinal compressive forces.
On this occasion, the average longitudinal compressive force (2-axle goods wagons 200kN and bogie wagons 240kN) should be exceeded of about 10 % in at least 10 of the tests.
According to point 4, no evaluation criterion shall be exceeded.
SCOPE OF MEASUREMENTS R.2.1.
Measurements during the tests As a minimum, the following values shall be measured during the tests and recorded: - Longitudinal Compressive Force FLxi - Wheel elevation dzij of all wheels - Lateral forces on axle-boxes Hyj of all wheels - Deformation of axle guards dAijy of all wheels (of goods wagons fitted with axle guards only) - Lateral movements dyP1, dyP2 of the buffers between the slave wagons and test wagon - Recording of track markers (Fig.
EVALUATION CRITERIA USED TO CALCULATE THE PERMISSIBLE LONGITUDINAL COMPRESSIVE FORCE. - Evaluation of a non-guide wheel dzij ≥ 50 mm over a distance of ≥ 2 m. - Climbing of the guide wheel dzij ≥ 5 mm for wheel load Qij %lt% 0; guide wheels are wheels 11 and 12 in 2 axle wagons.
This braked mass applies to hauled rakes that are ≤ 500 m long and braked in the P position.
The calculation method described below shall be used to design the brake equipment of wagons with a maximum speed of ≤ 120 km/h.
The braked mass that is painted on the wagon shall be determined in tests.
Once the braking distances have been calculated the braked mass shall be pre-determined using the procedure from chapter S.1.3.2, but with the calculated braking distances instead of the mean braking distances measured in tests.
For wagons as described in chapter S.1.2.1 that have a maximum speed of 140 km/h, the braked mass calculated for 120 km/h (cf.
The braked mass may be pre-determined using this calculation procedure, taking into account the following additional points: - The braking distance shall be calculated for braking from 100, 120, 140 and 160 km/h up to the maximum speed of the wagon; - Once the braking distances have been calculated, the braked mass shall be pre-determined using the procedure from chapter S.1.3.2, but with the calculated braking distances instead of the mean braking distances measured in tests.
The braked mass that is painted on the wagon shall be determined in tests (chapter S.1.3).
The slip brake tests shall be carried out at 100 km/h and 120 km/h.
The general test conditions can be found in chapter S.3.1.
The measured distance shall be corrected for nominal test conditions (vo nom) using the method given in chapter S.3.2.
The resulting minimum braked mass percentage shall be taken.

b) With Btest as the braked mass per insert holder in the test, the equations (1) and (2) above may be used to determine Fdyn test either by directly reading off the value.
The measured braking distances shall be corrected for the nominal test conditions (Vo nom) using the method given in chapter S.3.2.
The minimum value shall be taken from λ100, λ120, λ140 and λ160.
It is recommended that the tests be carried out on block-braked vehicles with wheels (either new or re-profiled) that have been run for at least 1200 km.
The correction shall be made by applying the following formula: Transformation gives the following: where: sjcorr [m] = corrected braking distance (which corresponds to the nominal speed in test j); sjmeas [m] = braking distance measured in test j; vjnom [km/h] = nominal initial speed in test j; vjmeas [km/h] = initial speed measured in test j; ρ = coefficient of inertia of the "rotating masses", which is defined as follows: where: m = mass of the test train or vehicle, mr = equivalent mass of the rotating components. (Where no exact value is known ρ = 1,15 for locomotives and ρ = 1,04 for coaches shall be used.); i [mm/m] = mean gradient over sjmeas on the test track, which is positive (+) for an upgrade and negative (-) for a downgrade.
For wagons with P10 block brakes and conventional brake rigging the dynamic efficiency shall be corrected using the method set out in S.1.3.1.
The mean braking distance shall be corrected using the following formulae: Fcorr = Ftest × ηmηtest × dtestdm and s—corr = te × vnom + Ftest + WmFcorr + Wm × s— - vnom × te where: s—corr [m] = corrected mean braking distance; s— [m] = mean braking distance in the test; te [s] = equivalent build-up time for the braking power; Vnom [m/s] = nominal initial speed in the test; dtest [mm] = mean wheel diameter on the vehicles tested; dm [mm] = diameter of the half-worn wheel; Fcorr [kN] = corrected braking power; Ftest [kN] = mean braking power in the test; ηM = efficiency of the brake rigging in average service conditions; ηtest = efficiency of the brake rigging in the test; Wm [kN] = mean resistance to forward motion.
This correction shall only be applied to tests with a vehicle taken in isolation.

WAGONS INTENDED TO RUN ON THE BRITISH NETWORK T.1.1.
Introduction The following freight wagon gauges are available on lines in Great Britain: W6, W7, W8 and W9.
The gauges are described below in Section A –W6, Section B — Sample Calculation, Section C — W7 and W8, Section D — W9.
Below 400 mm ARL, wagons shall comply with both reference profile and G1 and W6, taking whichever profile is more limiting in size.
The 2820 mm dimension on straight track (equivalent to 3024 mm on curves with 200 m radius) is allowed without application of the width reduction formulae.
Due account shall be taken of all lateral displacements, however caused, i.e.: (a) full lateral suspension travel, (b) full lateral suspension wear, (c) curve throw (Ei or Eo).
Additionally, under the foregoing conditions of full vertical deflection and wear, the vehicle must not infringe the gauge underclearances, relative to the 75, 100 and 135 mm ARL planes, when standing on a concave or convex vertical curve of 500 m radius.
Determination of Maximum Vehicle Width At any point of the vehicle, the combination of its: (1) maximum static width, plus (2) the sum of values derived from 1.2.1 a), b) and c), shall not exceed any one of the four values shown below: Curve radius (R) | Maximum Width (1) + (2) | Straight| [1] | 2700 mm | 360 m | 2700 mm | 200 m | 2820 mm | 160 m | 2900 mm | Diagram for Width Reduction Formulae Figure T3 +++++ TIFF +++++ A = wheelbase/bogie centres in metres.
At centre of the vehicle Ei = ANi - Ni2400 Ei = -0,051 m Ei is calculated as a negative value, hence no reduction is necessary. 1.3.
Total lateral suspension movements 1.4.1.1. (0,020 + 0,003) m = 23 mm (half-width reduction) 1.5.
Eo/Ei = zero Therefore maximum width over axlebox components is: 2700 - 2(23) = 2654 mm 1.6.
Ei = ANi - Ni2R for R = 360 m | Ei = 28 mm | (i) Therefore maximum width at R = 360 m: 2700 - 2(23) - 2(28) = 2598 mm for R = 200 m | Ei = 51 mm | (ii) Therefore maximum width at R = 200 m: 2820 - 2(23) - 2(51) = 2672 mm for R = 160 m | Ei 63 mm | (iii) Therefore maximum width at R = 160 m: 2900 - 2(23) - 2(63) = 2728 mm From the above it can be seen that case (i) produces the minimum value, and therefore the maximum permissible width at the centre of the vehicle is thus 2598 mm. 1.7.
Ei = ANo + No2R for R = 360 mm | Eo = 29 mm | (i) Therefore maximum width at R = 360 mm: 2700 - 2(23) - 2(29) = 2596 mm for R = 200 m | Eo = 52 mm | (ii) Therefore maximum width at R = 200 m: 2820 - 2(23) - 2(52) = 2670 mm For R = 160 m | Eo = 65 mm | (iii) Therefore maximum width at R = 160 m: 2900 - 2(23) - 2(65) = 2724 mm From the above it can be seen that case (i) produces the minimum value, and therefore the maximum permissible width at the vehicle headstock is thus 2596 mm. 3.
The vertical displacement Hi of a vehicle standing on a 500 m radius convex vertical curve, is given by the formula: Hi = ANi - Ni2R Hi = 20 mm. 3.4.
The vertical displacement Ho of a vehicle standing on a 500 m radius concave vertical curve, given by the formula: Ho = ANo + No2R Ho = 21 mm 3.4.2.
Note: Values obtained as described in Clause 3.3 and 3.4 above are additional, for the 75, 100 and 135 mm ARL planes only, to those calculated in Clause 3.1 and 3.2 above.
Reference profile of the gauge W9 (i) inner Fig.
T6 +++++ TIFF +++++ Container wagons have different positions for different sized Intermodal Units.
All loading alignments and possible movement during journeys shall be taken into account for both W9 (i) and W9 (o). 2.
Notes on the reduction formulae and other factors to be considered in the application of Gauge W9 2.1.
General 2.1.1.2.
This part of gauge W9 (i) shall be considered as static and the gauge width is unaffected by lateral movements of the suspension up to a limiting value of 13 mm (including wear).
The W9 (i) gauge width shall, be reduced in width, either side of the centre line, by an amount corresponding to the lateral movements of the suspension exceeding the limiting value of 13 mm.
Reduction Ei (metres) to be made on each side of the gauge at a section between axles/bogies: Ei = ANi - Ni2400 - 0,114 Note - A negative value calculated from the above Clause 1.1.3 indicates that the reduction to be applied is nil. - No reduction is necessary at the centre of the vehicle unless the distance between bogie centres exceeds 13,5 m.
The following shall not be included: e) Vehicle roll f) Axleguard deflection g) Wheel flange to rail clearance h) Wheel flange and rail wear 2.1.3.
Reduction Ei (metres) to be made on each side of the gauge at a section between bogies: Ei = ANi - Ni2R 2.1.6.2.
Note: Any width reduction derived from the above applies equally to all width co-ordinates in the area between 1000 mm and 780 mm ARL.
No increase in width of this gauge is permitted. 3.
Width reductions calculated in accordance with data relating to W9 (i) gauge. 3.1.1.
Total lateral suspension travel = 13 mm.
At centre of wagon: Ei = ANi - Ni22R For R = 360 m | Ei = 63 mm | (i) Therefore maximum width at R = 360 m will be: 2810 - (2x63) - (2x13) - (2 x 6,5) = 2645 mm For R = 200 m | Ei = 114 mm | (ii) Therefore maximum width at R = 200 m will be: 2912 - (2 x 114) - (2 x 13) - (2 x 6,5) = 2645 mm For R = 160 m | Ei 142 mm | (iii) Therefore maximum width at R = 160 m will be: 2970 - (2 x 142) - (2 x 13) - (2 x 6,5) = 2647 mm The above cases (i) and (ii) both produce a minimum value and therefore the maximum permissible width of the load unit at the centre of the loadable deck length is thus 2645 mm. 4.
Gauge W9 (o) is specified for a wagon with a distance of 13,5 m between bogie centres.
General This part of gauge W9 (o) is to be considered as static and the gauge width is unaffected by lateral travel of the suspension up to a limiting value of 13 mm.
However the W9 (o) gauge shall be reduced in width, either side of the centre line, by the amount by which the total lateral suspension travels exceeds the standard limiting value of 13 mm.
Note - A negative value calculated indicates that nil reduction is necessary. - No reduction is necessary unless the distance to the end of the loadable decks exceeds 2,798 m for a wagon with bogie centres equal to 13,5m.
The area 1000 mm above rail level is an absolute minimum with a width of 2796 mm.
Determination of gauge widths At any point of the vehicle, the combination of its: (i) maximum static width, plus (ii) the sum of values derived from 2.1.1 a), b), c) and d) shall not exceed any one of the three values shown below: Curve radius (R) | maximum width (i) + (ii) | 360 m | 2710 mm | 200 m | 2820 mm | 160 m | 2900 mm | 4.2.2.3.

For wagons to be used solely in the UK, a parking brake shall be designed such that fully loaded wagons shall be held on a gradient of 2,5 % with a maximum of 10 % adhesion with no wind.
The standard mean coefficient of friction historically used, as the basis for the calculations, is 0,13.
iii) Factors to be considered in the derivation of brake force The brake retarding force for a vehicle can be calculated from design data or derived from the results of braking distance tests, in either case this must be from the rail vehicle maximum speed.
Where there is one vehicle number to cover vehicles that are semi-permanently coupled by bar type couplers or are articulated, the correct brake retarding force must be calculated for each distributor by using the vehicle weight controlled by each distributor. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX W SPECIFIC CASES Kinematic gauge FINLAND, STATIC GAUGE FIN1 W.1.

GENERAL rules 1.1.
VEHICLE PARTS IN PROXIMITY OF THE WHEEL FLANGES 3.1.
The minimum vertical distance allowed for vehicle parts located in the vicinity of the wheel flanges, except the wheel themselves, is 55 mm from the running surface.
This distance of 55 mm does not apply to the flexible parts of the sanding system or to the flexible brushes. 3.2.
In exception for the point 3.1, the minimum vertical distance allowed for parts beyond end axles is 125 mm, for vehicles which are retarded by a movable, manually on the rail placed drag shoe. 3.3.
The minimum distance of brake components which should come in contact with the rail can be smaller than 55 mm from the rail when the components are stationary.
The lowered pantograph in middle position on a straight track should not protrude out the vehicle gauge. 6.2.
The raised pantograph in middle position on a straight track should not protrude out the vehicle gauge given in Appendix E.
Non-insulated parts (25 kV) on the roof should not penetrate the zone indicated in Appendix E.
Besides items W.1-W.6, the vehicles designed for the western traffic also comply with prescriptions of UIC Leaflets 505-1 or 506.
The lower part of the vehicles able to board ferries should later comply with UIC Leaflet 507 (wagons) or 569 (coaches and vans). 7.2.
Loading gauges are dealt with by a separate regulation. -------------------------------------------------- VEHICLE GAUGES FIN1/Appendix A Figure W.1 +++++ TIFF +++++ 1) Lower part of the vehicles able to pass over marshalling humps and rail brakes. 2) Lower part of the vehicles unable to pass over marshalling humps and rail brakes except for bogies of powered units, see note 3). 3) Lower part of the bogies of powered units unable to pass over marshalling humps and rail brakes. 4) Gauge of the vehicles able to run on lines individuated in Jtt (technical specifications related to Finnish Railway's safety standards), where the obstacle gauge has been accordingly widened. -------------------------------------------------- FIN1/Appendix B1 Increase of the minimum height of the lower part of the vehicle able to pass over marshalling humps and rail brakes The height of the lower part of vehicles should be increased by Eas and Eau so that: - if the vehicle runs on the top of a hump, no part between bogie pivots or between end axles could penetrate the running surface of a hump the vertical curvature radius of which is 250 m; - if the vehicle runs in the concavity of the hump, no part beyond bogie pivots or beyond end axles could penetrate the gauge of rail brakes of a concavity the vertical curvature radius of which is 300 m.
a = distance between bogie pivots or between end axles; n = distance from the cross section considered to the nearest bogie pivot (or the nearest end axle) h = height of the lower part of the vehicles above the running surface (see Appendix A). [1] Formulae are based on the vehicle gauge for tracks on marshalling humps as shown in Appendix B3 -------------------------------------------------- FIN1/Appendix B3 LOCATION OF THE RAIL BRAKES AND OTHER SHUNTING DEVICES OF MARSHALLING HUMPS Figure W.2 +++++ TIFF +++++ PASSING TRACKS: On the passing tracks of marshalling humps Rmin = 500 m, and the height of obstacle gauge above the running surface is h = 0 mm across the whole vehicle gauge width (= 1700 mm from track centreline).
The obstacle gauge for the marshalling yard is valid outside this area (RAMO item 2.9 and RAMO 2 Annex 2, related to the gauge of marshalling yards, and also RAMO 2 Annex 5 related to the points of crossings). -------------------------------------------------- FIN1/Appendix C Reduction of the half-width according to the vehicle gauge FIN1, (reduction formulae) 1.
General rules The cross dimensions of the vehicles computed according to the vehicle gauge (Appendix A) should be decreased by the quantities Es or Eu, so that, when the vehicle is in its least favourable position (without inclination on its suspension) and on a track of radius R = 150 m, with a track gauge of 1,544 m, no part of the vehicle protrude the half-width of the vehicle gauge FIN1 by more than (36/R + k) from the track centreline.
Reductions are calculated according to formulae given in chapter 2. 2.
Reduction values The half-width of vehicle cross-sections should be decreased: 3.1 For sections between bogie pivots; By the greater of values Es and Es∞ . 3.2 For sections beyond bogie pivots; By the greater of values Eu and Eu∞. [1] If the vehicle has no actual bogie pivot, a and n should be determined on the base of a fictional pivot located at the intersection of the longitudinal centrelines of the bogie and of the frame, the vehicle being in middle position (0,026 + q + w = 0) on a curved track of radius 150 m.
If the distance between the pivot calculated by this manner and the bogie centre point is denoted y, the term p2 should be replaced by p2 - y2 in reduction formulae. -------------------------------------------------- FIN1/Appendix D1 GAUGE OF THE VEHICLE LOWER STEP 1.
To avoid a uselessly wide gap between the step and the platform edge and taking account of the lower vehicle step and of high platforms (550/1800 mm), the value 1,700 - E can be exceeded in compliance with Appendix C, if a fixed step is concerned.
In the opposite case, the check is made on a straight and on a curved track where As/u is maximum. 6.
Gauge check Gauge check for the lower steps should be carried out on a straight track and on a 500 m curve, if value w is constant or varies linearly according to 1/R.
Otherwise, the check should be carried out on a straight track and on curve where As/u is maximum. 7.
In this case the checks hereafter should be carried out, among others to evidence that, in spite of the additional displacement, neither the door nor the step interfere with the fixed equipment (RAMO item 2.9 Annex 2).
Special remark Freight wagons are suitable for running speed Vmax = 120 km/h with their maximum design load (even if the brake performance at maximal load is not sufficient) when they fulfil the following technical parameters: - Two-axle wagons: Tare: | ≥ 10 t | Wheelbase: | 2a* ≥ 6,0 m 2a* ≥ 8,0 m by wagons fitted with double link suspension | Design requirements of the suspensions: | according to the types of suspensions in the following table Y4 | - Bogie wagons Tare | ≥ 16 t | Design requirements of the bogies: | according to the types of bogies in the following tables Y1 and Y3 | Y.1 TWO AXLE BOGIES Table Y.1: Two-axle bogies for wagons operating up to 100km/h Type of Bogie | Max.

STRENGTH OF WAGON BODY STRUCTURES YY.2.1.
Combined stresses For certain types of wagons, such as those with offset/depressed decks, it is particularly important to consider the combination of the stresses due to horizontal and vertical loading.
There are four loading cases: a) transverse force applied to all side uprights; b) longitudinal force applied to all end posts; c) in the case of metal walls, transverse force acting on a point in the side-wall at the ventilation opening and along its centre-line; d) in the case of metal walls, longitudinal force acting along the centre-Iine of the end-wall.
Strength of side doors Sliding doors (single and two-leafed) Transverse loading The door(s) in closed position and locked, should sustain a horizontal normal force from the inside of the wagon outwards, representing the forces produced by a shift in the load as well as by pressure differences resulting from the high-speed passing of passenger trains in tunnels.
This force is applied in the following conditions: a) at the centre of the door a force of 8kN applied over a 1x1 m area; b) at each connection/attachment point a force of 5 kN applied over 300x300 mm area.
This force represents the forces produced by a shift of the load as well as by pressure differences resulting from the high-speed passing of passenger trains in tunnels.
Forces resulting from the passing of trains Individual strength requirements for the outside connection/attachment points of the sliding wall (front surface over an area 200 mm high and 300 mm wide): a) with two-axled wagons and with bogie wagons with more than 2 sliding walls per side; force = 11,5 kN b) with bogie wagons with 2 sliding walls per side; force = 14 kN. +++++ TIFF +++++ The point of application should be immediately above the floor and, in the roof area, as close as possible to the upper connection/attachment point.
Strength of lockable partitions of sliding-wall wagons When the partition is locked a force which corresponds to a buffing impact of 5 t at a speed of 13 km/h and which simulates the stresses produced by a paIletised load should be applied to a square surface area of 1x1 m , 600 m and 1100 mm above the top of the floor.
A force of 50 kN should be applied to the seat of the lower lock over an area measuring 100 x 100 mm.
Wagons for the transport of heavy part-load goods Strength of side-walls The side-walls should withstand a total force of 30 kN applied at the 4 door pillars, 1,5 m above the floor.
Strength of side-wall door According to 3.2.
Strength of roof According to 3.6.
Resistance of side-walls to transverse forces and of the edges of side and end rails to impacts The following load cases apply, acting outwards in the horizontal direction at a level of 1,5 m above the floor: a) a force of 100 kN applied at four centre posts of each side-wall, as indicated below; b) a force of 40 kN applied at the corner posts of wagons equipped with drop ends; c) 25 kN at the middle of the upper side-wall rails; d) 60 kN at the middle of the upper rail of the end swing doors, for wagons equipped with these.
Local deformation tests Denting tests should be performed on the upper rails of the side-walls by applying a vertical force of 40 kN, as indicated below.
Strength of the side doors A horizontal force of 20 kN should be applied at a the height of the door locking bar or 1 m above the floor and on the centre-line of the opening.
Strength of the side and end flaps The requirement is to carry the load due to a lorry loaded to 65 kN per twin carrying wheel bearing on a total surface of 700 cm2 {width of wheel about 200 mm) on the flaps lowered onto the buffers or onto supports rigidly fastened to the buffer beam in the case of the end flaps, and onto a high platform in the case of the side flaps.
Strength of the fixed side-wall flaps The fixed side-wall flaps should be subjected to a force of 30 kN, applied over an area measuring about 350 x 200 mm at the edge, directed horizontally from inside the wagon towards the outside and applied at the middle of the side.
Strength of the side stanchions Pivoting or removable side stanchions should take the following loads: - An outward horizontal load of 35 kN acting at 500 mm from the centre of the bore-hole (swivelling Stanchion) - An outward horizontal load of 35 kN acting at 500 mm from the upper fixation flange (removable stanchion).
