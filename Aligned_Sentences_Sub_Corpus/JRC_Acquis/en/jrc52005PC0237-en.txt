The information is exchanged for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, in order to carry out controls on persons at the external borders or on national territory, and for the issuance of visas and residence permits.
Existing provisions and related proposals Articles 92 – 119 of the Schengen Convention are the basic legal provisions governing the SIS.
The Commission has, therefore, decided to submit two proposals given the cross-pillar nature of the SIS: a Regulation based on Title IV of the EC Treaty and a Decision based on Title VI of the Treaty on the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the “EU Treaty”), for the establishment, operation and use of the SIS II.
These two instruments, which are intended to replace Article 92 to 119 of the Schengen Convention, needed to be completed by an instrument allowing the access to the SIS II by vehicle registration services.
This article stipulates that for the purpose of implementing the common transport policy, the Council shall adopt “any other appropriate provisions”, in accordance with the procedure referred to in article 251 EC Treaty and after consultation of the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.
The same legal basis was chosen for the August 2003 Proposal for a Regulation amending the Schengen Convention as regards access to the SIS by the services in the Member States responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles.
According to Article 5(1) of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union, proposals and initiatives building upon the Schengen acquis shall be subject to the relevant provisions of the Treaties, even if, according to paragraph 2 of the same article, the Council has not adopted the measures referred to in Article 2(1), second subparagraph of that Protocol.
This is currently the case for Articles 92 to 119 of the Schengen Convention.
The choice of Article 71 EC Treaty as a legal basis for this proposal signifies that access to the SIS by vehicle registration services has a basis in the EC Treaty.
The Commission outlined the main budgetary implication and prepared a common financial statement attached to its proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment, operation and use of SIS II. 2005/0104(COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL regarding the access to the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) by the services in the Member States responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 71 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[8], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[9], Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[10], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[11], Whereas: 1.
