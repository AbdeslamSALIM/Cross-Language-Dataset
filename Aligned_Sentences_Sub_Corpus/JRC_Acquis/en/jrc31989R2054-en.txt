Where it is found that prices on resale, directly or via commercial intermediaries, are more than 15 % less than the minimum price for a consignment imported, the weighted average of those prices shall be considered as the import price. 4.
Where the factors referred to in paragraph 1 are expressed in a currency other than that of the Member State in which the products are released for free circulation, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1766/85 (1) on the rates of exchange to be used in the determination of customs value shall apply. 5.
Article 3 The minimum import price shall be adjusted by a monetary coefficient determined in such a way as to convert that price with the average rate of exchange used for the fixing or alteration of the monetary compensatory amounts.
Control and taxation on import Article 4 The competent national authorities shall, whenever a declaration for release for free circulation is accepted, compare the declared import price with the minimum import price applicable to the goods on the day the declaration is accepted.
When the price shown on the invoice is for deferred payment during a period exceeding three months, the price shown on the invoice shall be reduced by 1 % for each month of deferral granted in excess of those three months.
Article 5 Where the import price is less than the minimum import price applicable to the goods, the competent national authorites shall levy a countervailing charge fixed by reference to a scale of import prices.
Special control procedure Article 6 1.
The minimum import price shall be deemed to be observed if the importer furnishes proof in respect of at least 95 % of the consignment imported that the product was sold to the end user without further processing, after packaging, directly or via commercial intermediaries at a price at least equel to the minimum import price. 2.
The application of the special control procedure shall be without prejudice to the a posterori checks referred to in Articles 8, 9 and 10.
A posteriori checks Article 8 The importer shall keep available for examination by the competent authorities, in view of a posteriori checks, proof of payment to the seller and all commercial documents such as invoices, contracts and correspondence concerning the purchase and the sale of the products in question for at least three years following the year in which the declaration for release for free circulation was accepted.
Checks must be carried out each calendar year on about 10 % of the consigments imported.
Article 10 Where, in the course of a check, the competent authorities find that the minimum import price has not been observed, they shall levy a countervailing charge less any amount already paid beforehand as a countervailing charge.
Final provisions Article 11 Member States shall inform the Commission once a year, before the end of the first six months, of the checks carried out in the previous year to verify the observance of the minimum import prices.
