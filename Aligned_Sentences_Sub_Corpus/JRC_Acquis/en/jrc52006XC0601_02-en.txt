Its mountain and hill terrain, (favouring unusually intense illumination and ventilation of the trees, well known determinants for outstanding quality), moderate rainfall (about 550 mm), mild spring, relatively dry and warm summer (during which however a beneficial 15 % of total annual rainfall occurs), high level of sunshine and moderately strong north winds, conduce to production of an oil that is of a rich colour and pleasing delicate flavour.
National requirements : Law 2040/92, Presidential Decree 61/93 and Joint Ministerial Decision 2823003/ 12.1.2004 apply.
