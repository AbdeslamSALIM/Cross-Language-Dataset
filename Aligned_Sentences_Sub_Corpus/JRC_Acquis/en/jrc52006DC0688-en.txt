The Commission Communication on the Review of the EU Regulatory Framework proposes new rules to strengthen security and privacy in the electronic communications sector [2].
As an example, in the Netherlands an 85% reduction in Dutch spam was achieved by investing €570 000 in equipment to fight spam.
Industry experts estimate that 'botnets' relay over 50 percent of abusive e-mails [10].
The work done so far - actions Undertaken since 2004 The EU adopted in 2002 a Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications that puts a ban on spam [12] by introducing the principle of consent-based marketing to natural persons.
In January 2004, the Commission presented a Communication on spam identifying actions to complement the Directive [13].
Awareness actions The Commission Communication contributed in raising awareness of spam at national and international level around the globe.
A joint EU CNSA – LAP workshop was held in November 2005.
The OECD adopted a Recommendation on Cross-Border Co-operation in the Enforcement of Laws against Spam which was adopted in April 2006, urging enforcement authorities to share information and work together [19].
The Commission is further promoting international cooperation initiatives.
Industry actions The Commission welcomes industry's pro-active role in relation to spam.
Filtering measures imposed in Finland reduced the proportion of spam in the transmitted e-mail from 80 % to about 30 %.
Spyware can also be hidden in software distributed through other media such as CD-ROMs for installation on a computer.
Security measures by service providers An ENISA survey in 2006 [33] confirms that service providers in general have taken measures to tackle spam.
The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party adopted an Opinion on privacy issues related to the provision of email screening services [34] which provides guidance on the question of confidentiality of email communications and, more specifically, on the filtering of on-line communications against viruses, spam, and illegal content. 4.2.5.
Proposed actions The Commission invites: - companies to ensure that the standard of information for the purchase of software applications is in accordance with data protection law. - companies to contractually prohibit illegal use of software in advertisements, monitor how advertisements reach consumers and follow up on malpractice. - e-mail service providers to apply a filtering policy which ensures compliance with the recommendation and guidance on e-mail filtering. 4.3.
This policy will be presented in a Communication planned for adoption in the beginning of 2007. 4.3.1.
Proposed actions The Commission will: - continue efforts in raising awareness and fostering cooperation between stakeholders - continue to develop agreements with third countries including the issue of the fight against spam, spyware and malware - aim to introduce new legislative proposals at the beginning of 2007 that strengthen the rules in the area of privacy and security in the communications sector and present a policy on cyber crime - involve ENISA expertise in security matters - support research and development in its FP7 program. 5.
