PROCEDURE (1) Starting in the autumn of 2002, the Commission had informal contacts with the German and Dutch authorities on State aid in favour of the German and Dutch sections of a propylene pipeline project.
It sent a letter to Germany on 13 February 2002 and received a reply on 27 March 2003.
The Association of Petrochemical Producers in Europe (APPE) sent a position paper in support of the project by letter of 15 May 2003.
By letters of 24 July, 4 September and 16 October 2003, the German, Dutch and Belgian authorities notified aid for their own sections of the project.
The decision was sent to Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium the same day; the procedures were registered under Nos C 67/03, C 68/03 and C 69/03 respectively.
Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium commented on the decision by letters of 12, 18 and 22 December 2003.
The Commission asked for further information by letters of 23 January 2004, to which the Member States concerned replied by letters of 20 February, 27 February and 2 March 2004. (4) The Commission decision was published in the Official Journal of the European Union of 24 December 2003 [2].
Lastly, the three Member States provided further information by letters of 25 May and 4 June 2004. 2.
In western Europe some 70 % of all propylene is a by-product of the production of ethylene.
The total size of the western European market was estimated at some 14,7 million tonnes in 2001, half of which is used in the area that would be served by the pipeline.
Estimates for future growth of the propylene market range from 3,7 % to 4,0 % for the coming years.
The ethylene market is characterised by much lower growth of around 2 %. (6) At present, some 550 barges (1500 tonnes each) and 4800 rail tankers (50 tonnes each) carrying propylene arrive in the Rotterdam-Antwerp-Cologne triangle each year.
The total quantity transported from Rotterdam to South Limburg would be about 180000 tonnes per year, equivalent to 900 rail tankers and 70 barges. 2.1.2.
The beneficiary (8) The beneficiary will be European Pipeline Company BV (EPC), a consortium of companies in the chemical industry.
Its predecessor was European Pipeline Development Company (EPDC).
The shareholders are BASF AG, Celanese Chemical Europe GmbH, Shell Nederland Chemie BV, DSM NV, Rütgers Chemicals AG, Sasol Germany GmbH, Veba Oil Refining %amp% Petrochemicals GmbH, Westgas GmbH and SABIC Europe.
The consortium owns the Dutch assets, 100 % of the Belgium asset management company, EPDC Flanders NV, and 49,9 % of the German asset management company, Propylenpipeline Ruhr GmbH (PRG) [3].
Landesentwicklungsgesellschaft Nordrhein-Westfalen (LEG) [4] owns the remaining 50,1 % but is not liable for any financial obligation beyond its participation in the company’s capital.
EPC and the Belgian and German asset management companies together established a joint venture, European Pipeline Administration Company (EPAC), that will be responsible for managing the entire pipeline. 2.1.3.
The pipeline project (9) The notifications concern a pipeline for the transportation of propylene from Rotterdam, via Antwerp, Tessenderloo, Geleen and Cologne to Oberhausen in the Ruhr area.
The network will be approximately 520 km long.
The German notification concerns only the section between Oberhausen, via Cologne, and the Dutch border (Pilot 2), where it connects to another section in the Northern Ruhr area (Pilot 1).
In addition to the investment in the pipeline, new storage capacity will be built in the Dutch and Belgian ports and in Duisburg, Germany.
The capacity of the pipeline should be sufficient for dealing with the growth expected over the next 20 years.
They will be determined on the basis of the number of sections passed through. (12) The fees will be established in a transparent manner and will be fixed at a level comparable with the transport fees for rail and inland water transport.
The aid (14) Germany intends to grant a direct subsidy equal to 80 % of the calculated deficit for normal profitability (unrentierlichen investiven Kosten) for the German section of the pipeline (Pilot 2), with a ceiling of 50 % of the total investment cost.
The aid would amount to EUR 18682000.
The German aid and the Dutch aid are ad hoc measures that are not part of a particular scheme. (16) Belgium intends to grant a direct subsidy of EUR 2919480 and a five-year exemption from property tax, the benefit of which is estimated at EUR 766000.
The Belgian authorities take the view that the aid is covered by a State aid scheme approved by the Commission [9].
The scheme provides for aid of 12 % for this type of investment, corresponding to the amount of EUR 2919480 mentioned above.
Costs not eligible for aid under the scheme include costs for general research, land acquisition and commissions. (17) The Belgian aid has been notified with a view to obtaining legal certainty and providing the Commission with an overview of the investment project, together with the total amount of aid granted. (18) The three Member States have made the aid conditional on compliance with the principles of open access and non-discrimination for 25 years, i.e.
At present, there are five separate systems in Europe for ethylene.
For propylene, there are a number of individual systems in and around the Benelux area.
The pipeline reduces the need for such relocation. (27) The Netherlands has put the immediate social return (traffic safety, emissions and noise) on the subsidy at 12 %. 2.2.3.
A 1998 study singled out the lack of appropriate infrastructure as the major factor hampering competitiveness.
It would also reduce the uncertainty of propylene supply to customers stemming from disruptions in propylene production in steam crackers. (29) In 1999 the chemical raw materials industry in the Emscher-Lippe region in Germany provided jobs for 5233 people.
Of these jobs, some 1906 were reported as being heavily dependent on propylene-based products (1506 in the raw materials industry and 400 in plastics processing).
Without the propylene pipeline the potential in this region would be used to the extent of 50 % at most.
For the raw materials industry, the project would create 658 jobs by 2010, disregarding multiplier effects.
The aid would not be covered by the Community guidelines on State aid for environmental protection [11] (environmental aid guidelines), the guidelines on national regional aid [12] (regional aid guidelines) or by any other guidelines laid down by the Commission.
Lastly, the Commission wondered whether there would not be undue distortion of competition, notably between chemical companies participating directly in the project and other companies in the chemical and related industries and between the chemical industry in the region concerned and that in other regions of the Community. 4.
COMMENTS FROM THIRD PARTIES (32) The Commission received comments from Deutsche Bahn and from two competitors in the chemical industry. (33) Deutsche Bahn confirms the Commission’s analysis and takes the view that the aid is detrimental to its interests as pipeline transport will replace rail transport, causing a loss in turnover of some EUR 13000000 per year.
Firstly, only polymer-grade propylene will be transported, not chemical- or refinery-grade, the propylene content of which is lower.
Polymer-grade propylene accounts for only 60 % of the market.
Fourthly, the pipeline may shift investments from coastal locations in the Benelux to, say, Germany. (35) The second competitor agrees that the transport of light hydrocarbons by pipeline is attractive in terms of efficiency and safety and that a sound infrastructure promotes investment and employment in the areas linked by the pipeline.
Without investment in propylene production in the ARA area, the pipeline would remain underutilised. 5.
Hence the measure would fall within the scope of Article 73 of the Treaty. (40) The aid would give the project an internal rate of return of 5,6 % in Germany.
A higher return would not be possible: in case of higher-than-expected proceeds over the first 15 years, a corresponding amount would be recovered from the beneficiary.
The pipeline will still belong to the company after 15 years, but the company will derive no advantage. (41) As the pipeline forms part of a Europe-wide network, there will be no distortion of competition for the chemical industry in other regions of the Community. 5.3.
In addition to the calculation of the project’s internal rate of return (6,19 %), it notes that the rates of return in competing modes of transport are similarly low, in the range of 1 to 8 %.
Comments from interested parties (45) With respect to the comments from Deutsche Bahn, the three Member States stress that the subsidy will be used only for the pipeline infrastructure and not for actual transport and that the fees will be set by reference to those for competing modes of transport.
Moreover, most of the necessary investments in transport by inland waterway or by rail are not intended specifically for propylene but can be used for other liquefied gases.
Lastly, Deutsche Bahn can join EPDC.
Success of the pipeline project may be important for Deutsche Bahn as the pipeline creates opportunities for transporting propylene further inland. (46) With respect to the comments from the first competitor, the three Member States point out that polymer-grade propylene is the only all-purpose grade.
The pipeline, in fact, opens up the prospect of a European single market for propylene. (47) With respect to the comments from the second competitor, the three Member States point out that all the expected values given by both the participants and independent experts point to a disproportionately high increase in propylene demand in the next few decades.
In fact, if SABIC does go ahead with the investment, the Geleen site will have an even greater need for the pipeline in order to provide operational flexibility in the event of an unexpected failure in either the production or consumption process.
In addition, cracker capacity is being expanded at Terneuzen, which came on stream in 2002 providing 300 kt for consumers in the Antwerp-Rotterdam area.
ASSESSMENT 6.1.
Existence of State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty (48) State funding for the construction or management of transport infrastructure is not always to be regarded as aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty.
The authorities concerned have simply responded to a private initiative. (b) The pipeline is being depreciated over 25 years and the conditions for granting the aid apply for 15 or 25 years, but the pipeline remains the property of the asset management companies. (c) Participation in the pipeline company is, in principle, open to any company but, in practice, only propylene and ethylene producers are directly involved. (d) The company is to operate on the basis of the "low-profit principle".
The aid effectively allows an internal rate of return of 5,6 % for the German section.
Consequently, a higher rate of return cannot be ruled out. (49) For these reasons, there is a selective advantage for EPC, as compared with the other enterprises that could have undertaken the project and with competitors providing alternative transport services.
The Commission notes that the total investment cost exceeds EUR 25000000 and that the total aid exceeds the gross grant equivalent of EUR 5000000.
Therefore, even if the Belgian aid were covered by an approved aid scheme, the notification requirement pursuant to point 76 of the environmental aid guidelines is applicable. 6.2.
Article 73 of the Treaty states that aid is compatible with the Treaty if it meets the needs of coordination of transport.
Transport by pipeline causes less pollution than other modes of transport operated by competitors, including even transport by rail or inland waterway.
For facilities that are accessible on non-discriminatory terms for all existing and potential operators, an aid intensity of up to 50 % of the total project cost has been allowed.
Pipeline transport, like the transport infrastructure projects referred to in paragraph 38, reduces emissions and is safer compared with other modes of transport.
Compliance with this principle is guaranteed for a period of 25 years, which is the depreciation period for the pipeline, and it is expected that the capacity of the pipeline will, in the normal course of events, be sufficient to avoid bottlenecks for the next 20 years. (57) The notified aid can be considered to be necessary and proportional to the objectives in mind.
For the rest, it should be pointed out that the subsidy is limited to a level that allows not more than a normal internal rate of return (IRR) on the investments for the companies involved.
The calculation for the entire project gives an IRR of 6,19 % over 25 years, but one of only 2,75 % when calculated over 15 years.
Without subsidies these rates would be 3,80 % and – 0,24 %.
Even the figure of 6,19 % can be considered as being equal to or below a normal rate of return for this type of project.
The post-tax IRR on other chemical and oil pipeline systems in Europe has been between 9 and 13 % over 25 years.
IRRs on equivalent systems in the United States have a slightly higher IRR (in the range of 11 to 15 %).
Returns on power stations and similar installations are in the range of 10 to 13 % over shorter periods, e.g. 15 years.
The expectations of the chemical industry for new chemical plants are above 15 %, with actual returns tending to be lower (9 to 15 %), depending on the type of plant and the tax regime.
Furthermore, the IRR calculated is higher than average returns in rail transport (1 to 3 %) and bulk road transport (3 to 4 %), but comparable to those for the transport of chemicals by inland waterway (7 to 8 %). (58) Distortions of competition between the companies participating directly in the project and other companies in the chemical and related industries are limited.
In any case, the pipeline does not hamper the transport of propylene of other grades by rail and inland waterway.
The apparently most important positive effect on competition will derive from the increased flexibility of supply and from standardisation based on polymer-grade propylene, and this will make it easier for propylene consumers to switch supplier. (60) In accordance with point 29 of the environmental aid guidelines, the Commission may authorise investment aid enabling firms to improve on the Community standards applicable up to no more than 30 % gross of the eligible investment costs.
In addition, if the benefit results not, in the first place, from the lower cost of transport but from improved flexibility of supply, they will, in any event, be major beneficiaries.
For all these reasons, the overall aid level seems appropriate. (61) The pipeline will distort competition as regards inland waterway and rail transport, as Deutsche Bahn maintains.
