Accordingly, in the interest of free movement of goods and equal competition conditions among the Member States, as well as consumer protection, it is appropriate that maximum residue levels (MRLs) for products of plant and animal origin be set at Community level. (3) A Regulation establishing MRLs does not require transposition into national law in the Member States.
The residues of active substances in products of plant and animal origin arising from unauthorised use or from environmental contamination or from use in third countries should be carefully controlled and monitored. (8) The basic rules with regard to food and feed law are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety [9]. (9) In addition to those basic rules, more specific rules are needed to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market and trade with third countries in relation to fresh, processed and/or composite plant and animal products intended for human consumption or animal feed in which pesticide residues may be present, whilst providing the basis for securing a high level of protection for human and animal health and the interests of consumers.
Such rules should include the establishment of specific MRLs for each pesticide in food and feed products and the quality of the data underlying these MRLs. (10) Notwithstanding the fact that the principles of the general food law laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 apply only to feed for food-producing animals, in view of the difficulty of segregating products to be used as feed intended for animals which are not destined for food production and in order to facilitate the control and the enforcement of the provisions of this Regulation, it is appropriate to apply them also to feed which is not intended for food-producing animals.
Accordingly it is appropriate that the rules set out in this Regulation also apply to those products in addition to the specific rules for animal nutrition. (14) It is necessary to define at Community level certain terms used for the setting and control of MRLs for products of plant and animal origin. (15) Directive 76/895/EEC provides that Member States may authorise higher levels of MRLs than are currently authorised at Community level.
Therefore, MRLs cannot be set immediately for the residues of pesticides currently regulated by Directive 76/895/EEC or for pesticides for which Community MRLs have not yet been set. (17) It is appropriate that the minimum data requirements to be used when considering the setting of MRLs for pesticides be laid down at Community level. (18) In exceptional circumstances, and in particular for unauthorised pesticides that may be present in the environment, it is appropriate to permit the use of monitoring data in setting MRLs. (19) MRLs for pesticides should be continually monitored and should be changed to take account of new information and data.
In order to facilitate control of residues of pesticides, a default value is to be set for pesticide residues present in products or groups of products covered by Annex I for which no MRLs have been established in Annexes II or III, unless the active substance in question is listed in Annex IV.
It is appropriate to set the default value at 0,01 mg/kg and to provide for the possibility of setting it at a different level for active substances covered by Annex V, taking into account the routine analytical methods available and/or consumer protection. (20) For food and feed produced outside the Community, different agricultural practices as regards the use of plant protection products may be legally applied, sometimes resulting in pesticide residues differing from those resulting from uses legally applied in the Community.
It is appropriate that these measures and their effect on humans and, where relevant, animals be assessed by the European Food Safety Authority ('the Authority'). (22) The lifetime exposure, and where appropriate the acute exposure of consumers to pesticide residues via food products, should be evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. (23) Through the World Trade Organisation, the Community's trading partners should be consulted about the MRLs proposed, and their observations should be taken into account before the MRLs are adopted.
MRLs set at the international level by the Codex Alimentarius Commission should also be considered when Community MRLs are being set. (24) It is necessary that the Authority assess MRL applications and evaluation reports prepared by the Member States with a view to determining the associated risks to consumers and, where relevant, to animals. (25) Member States should lay down rules on sanctions applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented.
It is appropriate for the Community in certain cases to make a contribution to those costs. (27) It is good administrative practice and technically desirable to coordinate the timing of decisions on MRLs for active substances with decisions taken for those substances under Directive 91/414/EEC.
For many substances for which Community MRLs have not yet been set, decisions are not due to be taken under that Directive before the date of entry into force of this Regulation. (28) It is therefore necessary to adopt separate rules providing for temporary but mandatory harmonised MRLs, with a view to setting MRLs progressively as decisions are taken on individual active substances as part of the evaluations under Directive 91/414/EEC.
Such temporary harmonised MRLs should be based, in particular, on existing national MRLs established by the Member States and should respect the national arrangements by which they were established, provided that the MRLs do not present an unacceptable risk to consumers. (29) Following the inclusion of existing active substances in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, Member States are to re-evaluate each plant protection product containing those active substances within four years of the date of inclusion.
It is therefore appropriate that Member States establish national programmes to control these residues.
The results of the national control programmes are to be submitted to the Commission, the Authority and the other Member States and included in the Community annual report. (31) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [11]. (32) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objectives of facilitating trade whilst protecting the consumer to lay down rules on MRLs for products of plant and animal origin.
This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to Directives 98/8/EC [12] and 2002/32/EC and Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 [13].

INTRODUCTION On 14 March 2003 the Council received from the Commission a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on maximum residue levels of pesticides in products of plant and animal origin.
The European Parliament adopted its opinion at a first reading on 20 April 2004.
The European Economic and Social Committee adopted its opinion on 16 July 2003.
The Council adopted its common position on 19 July 2004, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty.
