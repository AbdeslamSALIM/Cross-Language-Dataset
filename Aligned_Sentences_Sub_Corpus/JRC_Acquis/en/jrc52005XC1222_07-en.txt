The 2001 amendment also extended the validity of the 1997 communication until 31 December 2004.
The validity of the 1997 communication was further extended until 31 December 2005 by a communication adopted by the Commission in 2004 [3].
The 2001 amendment also states in its introduction that: "The Commission wishes to inform Member States and interested parties that it intends to undertake a further study in 2003 to verify the capacity of the private reinsurance market to adapt to a further extension of the definition of marketable risk to cover a wider range of commercial risks, possibly including commercial risks arising in all countries of the world.
This new provision will apply from 1 January 2006 until 31 December 2010.
The Commission wishes to inform Member States and interested parties that in 2010 it will re-examine the capacity of the private reinsurance market to adapt the definition of "marketable" risks accordingly if necessary, in particular with regard to the new situation considered to give rise to "non-marketable" risks.
In point 2.5, the following paragraph is introduced after the first paragraph: "Notwithstanding the definition of "marketable" risks contained in the first sentence of the previous paragraph, if and to the extent that no private insurance market exists in a Member State, commercial and political risks incurred on public and non-public debtors established in the countries listed in the Annex are considered to be temporarily non-marketable if incurred by small and medium-sized enterprises falling within the relevant EU definition [5] and having a total annual export turnover not exceeding EUR 2 million [6].
Point 4.5 is replaced by the following: "This Communication will apply until 31 December 2010". [1] OJ C 281, 17.9.1997, p. 4. [2] OJ C 217, 2.8.2001, p. 2. [3] OJ C 307, 11.12.2004, p. 12. [4] Inter alia, the Commission will call on the help of the Council (for example, its Export Credits Group)". [5] Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of small and medium-sized enterprises, OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36, as may be amended in the future. [6] The calculation of the relevant annual export turnover will be effected according to Article 4 of Annex I of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003, as may be amended in the future.
