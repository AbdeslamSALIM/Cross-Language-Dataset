This White Paper also takes into account the results of the ‘Exchange of Views’ of 18 July 2005[2] and parallel initiatives such as the Report on financial integration by the Financial Services Committee[3], the Ecofin Council Conclusions of 11 October 2005 and the Report by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament on the current state of integration of EU financial markets[4].
WHITE PAPER ON FINANCIAL SERVICES 2005-2010 1.
A broad study will be carried out in 2008 to review possible inconsistencies and appropriateness of information requirements in the existing EC rules ; - This uncertainty is particularly acute in the area of collective investments .
This work may serve as a starting-point for comparable work in other areas; - In the context of the insurance Solvency II project, a major codification exercise is now underway.
The Commission will examine the key interrelated issues and will come forward with a Communication on this issue in 2006. 3.2.2 Explore delegation of tasks and responsibilities between supervisors Banking legislation already gives supervisors the possibility to delegate full responsibility for the supervision of a subsidiary to the supervisor of the parent company.
ONGOING AND FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES (2005-2010) 4.1.
Ongoing projects 4.1.1.
Retail Banking Three major retail initiatives are already underway: - In the area of mortgage credit, a White Paper will be released in 2006, announcing any initiatives necessary and economically justified to integrate the EU mortgage credit market; - On consumer credit, a modified proposal for a Directive has been published on 10 October 2005 aimed at creating a genuine internal market for consumer credit and improving consumers’ protection[32]; - The proposal for a Payments Services Directive will enhance competition and clarify rules for users’ and providers’ rights and obligations.
The Commission and the supervisory committees (CEBS and CEIOPS) have already started their work to revise article 16 of the Banking and article 15 of the Insurance Directives and to define common prudential criteria.
In banking a proposal is expected mid-2006; in insurance this work is expected to take place in the context of Solvency II. 4.1.4.
Once this process is finished, while taking into account any new market developments, the Commission will decide during 2006 on the course to take and whether to come forward with a formal proposal. 4.2.
Reflections underway 4.2.1.
Follow-up action is expected to start in 2006 (see also 4.1.3). 4.2.2.
A report will be published in spring 2006 together with appropriate policy recommendations. 4.2.3.
Insurance Guarantee Schemes The Commission will decide in 2006 whether to propose legislation in this area. 4.2.4.
The Commission considers that for the time being existing regulatory requirements (or those already in the pipeline such as MiFID level-2 measures) are sufficient and that Member States are better placed and self-regulation by market participants better fit to find the most appropriate additional responses to market developments. 4.4.
The Commission’s Green Paper of July 2005 on enhancing the framework for investment funds assesses the existing UCITS[38] framework in the light of current developments in the funds industry.
This commitment is driven forward in the GATS negotiations in the WTO Doha round and other trade negotiations.

No impact assessment has been carried out on Member States’ own legislative initiatives in the field of internal or judicial affairs. [9] See: http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/en/finances/actionplan. [10] The next Progress Report is foreseen for January 2006. [11] See http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/finances/cross-sector/index_en.htm#monitor. [12] See http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/finances/cross-sector/index_en.htm#interinstitutional. [13] The Lamfalussy process is applied in the Banking, Insurance and Occupational Pensions, Securities and UCITS sectors; horizontal issues like corporate governance, auditing and accounting are in principle not covered by the Lamfalussy process, unless initiatives in these areas specifically address financial services areas. [14] Apart from those where the implementation deadline is later than 2005. [15] The Commission envisages to organise a workshop with economic experts in autumn 2006 to prepare this work. [16] The consultation on the Green Paper did not identify real candidates for immediate withdrawal . [17] With hyperlinks to national implementing legislation.
See Section 2.3. [18] See: http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/finservices-retail/finuse_en.htm. [19] See: http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/finservices-retail/finnet/index_en.htm [20] With an increasing volume of cases (in 2001: 335; in 2002: 601; and in 2003: 796). [21] On 13 June 2005, the Commission decided to open enquiries in the financial services sector in the areas of retail banking and business insurance.
The enquiries will examine whether competition (in particular, cross-border competition) functions fully in these sectors. [22] The Commission is developing a Common Frame of Reference as a tool to improve the coherence of European contract law. [23] See: http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/finances/docs/cross-sector/mergers/cross-border-consolidation_en.pdf. [24] See: http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/finances/docs/cross-sector/mergers/survey-results_en.pdf: under B.1.2 Tax Barriers. [25] Communication ‘The Contribution of Taxation and Customs Policies to the Lisbon Strategy’. [26] In the area of investment funds, the treatment of fund mergers as a ‘taxable event’ is the biggest stumbling-block to this route of rationalisation of Europe’s over-crowded fund landscape. [27] See: http://europa.eu.int/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/02/195%amp%format=HTML%amp%aged=1%amp%language=EN%amp%guiLanguage=en [28] The Commission will launch a study on liquidity management in banks and Member States’ prudential requirements. [29] A conference on supervisory convergence in the banking sector will be organised in 2007. [30] These must be voluntarily, based on a shared principle of a duty to cooperate.
The Commission will continue its work to tackle these barriers impeding cross-border Clearing and Settlement with the assistance of different groups (CESAME, FISCO). [34] See: http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/finances/cross-sector/index_en.htm#obstacles and see paragraph 2.7. [35] See: http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/capital/docs/communication_en.pdf. [36] A multilateral Treaty on conflicts of law for securities held with an intermediary. [37] In the October 2004 Communication on ‘European Contract Law and the revision of the acquis’, the Commission announced that it will undertake an impact assessment on optional instruments. [38] See: http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/securities/ucits/index_en.htm [39] Responses will be published in autumn 2006. [40] Beyond the aspects already dealt with in the initiative on payments. [41] See Section 2.7.
