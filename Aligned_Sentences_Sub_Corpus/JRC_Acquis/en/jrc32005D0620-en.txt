However, the list of third countries and parts thereof in Part 1 of Annex II to that Decision as shown in the row relevant to the territory of AR-4 is not consistent with that.
For the sake of clarity the date of application in the specific conditions table for the unauthorised period should be corrected to 17 March 2005. (4) The Murmansk region of Russia is authorised for importation to the Community meat of farmed non-domestic animals other than suidae and solipeds.
