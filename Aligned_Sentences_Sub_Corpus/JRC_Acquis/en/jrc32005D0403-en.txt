Product | Class | Plastisol coated steel roof sheets as specified below and when incorporated into a single layer or built-up roofing system as detailed below | BROOF (t1)BROOF (t2)BROOF (t3) | Roofing sheets in accordance with EN 14782 and EN 14783, comprising profiled steel sheets, flat steel sheets or panels of coil coated galvanised or zinc-aluminium alloy coated steel of metal thickness ≥ 0,40 mm with an organic external (weather side) coating and, optionally, a reverse (internal) side organic coating.
The external coating is of a liquid-applied Plastisol paint of maximum nominal dry film thickness 0,200 mm, a PCS of not greater than 8,0 MJ/m2 and a maximum dry mass of 330 g/m2.
The reverse side organic coating (if any) has a PCS of not greater than 4,0 MJ/m2 and a maximum dry mass of 200 g/m2.Single-layer roofing system comprising a single skin, non-insulated roofing on a supporting structure (continuous or discrete supporting rails) of reaction to fire classification A2-s1, d0 or better.Built-up roofing system where the Plastisol coated steel roof sheets forms the external layer in a built-up assembly, where the supporting structure is of reaction to fire classification A2-s1, d0 or better and where immediately below the Plastisol coated steel sheet there is an insulating layer of reaction to fire classification A2-s1, d0 or better.
