Amended proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of THE Council establishing an integrated action programme in the field of lifelong learning Adaptation following the agreement of 17 May 2006 on the Financial Framework 2007-2013 (presented by the Commission pursuant to Article 250(2) of the EC Treaty) /* COM/2006/0236 final - COD 2004/0153 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 24.5.2006 COM(2006) 236 final 2004/0153 (COD) Amended proposal for a DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing an integrated action programme in the field of lifelong learning Adaptation following the agreement of 17 May 2006 on the Financial Framework 2007-2013 (presented by the Commission pursuant to Article 250(2) of the EC Treaty) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
Transmission of the Commission’s proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council [COM(2004) 474] in accordance with Treaty Article 175(1): 15 July 2004.
Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee: 10 February 2005 (CES0139/2005).
Opinion of the Committee of the Regions: 23 February 2005 (CDR0258/2004).
The Commission has, however, retained references in the programme Decision to all the new activities originally proposed, although without any corresponding budget allocation at this stage, to leave open the possibility for them to be introduced before 2013 should funds be available, either through re-allocations of the existing programme budget, or following a revision of the overall financial framework. 3.3.
Council amendments 4.2.1.
The Commission proposal contains two substantive amendments included in the Council’s text: (1) the re-introduction in Article 9 of consultation of the programme committee on individual selection decisions for projects and networks where the grant proposed exceeds EUR 1 million, and for the “Policy Development” Key Activity of the Transversal Programme; and (2) the extension of a decentralised project approach from Leonardo da Vinci pilot projects, to Comenius, Erasmus and Grundtvig in Articles 18(1)(c), 22(1)(b) and 30(1)(c). 4.2.3.
Following the Council’s text, it also makes a number of structural changes which clarify the architecture of the Decision: (1) former Article 3 “Definitions” (new Article 2) is moved to come before former Article 2 “Specific Programmes” (now Article 3 “Sub-Programmes”); (2) the specific objectives relating to each sub-programme are moved from former Article 2 to the respective “Objectives” Articles of each sub-programme, where they precede the operational objectives; (3) Article 9 covers the “implementing measures” for the entire programme and its sub-programmes, regrouping material previously included in additional “implementing measures” Articles under each sub-programme, which have consequently been removed; (4) former Article 13 “Joint Actions” has been deleted, and replaced by specific reference in new Article 13 to complementarity with relevant Community policies. 4.3.
Commission amendments 4.3.1.
Recital 19 is new, and refers to a new and significantly simpler system for supporting National Agency operating costs, through lump sum funding included in the agreement distributing the decentralised funds, rather than as a series of separate operating grant agreements. 4.3.2.
Suitable arrangements, analogous to those that exist under Erasmus, should be made for the recognition of the outcomes of such mobility. (28) Given the particular educational challenges facing the children of occupational travellers and mobile workers in Europe, full use should be made of the opportunities available under the Comenius Programme to support transnational activities targeted at their needs. (29) Increased mobility throughout Europe must be accompanied by constantly higher standards. (2130) In order to respond to the increased need to support activities at European level designed to achieve these policy objectives, to provide a means of supporting trans-sectoral activity in the fields of languages and ICT, and to strengthen the dissemination and exploitation of results of the programme, it is appropriate to complement the four sectoral sub-programmes with a transversal programme. (2231) In order to respond to the increasing need for knowledge and dialogue on the European integration process and its development, it is important to stimulate excellence in teaching, research and reflection in this field by supporting higher education institutions specialising in the study of the European integration process, European associations in the fields of education and training and the Jean Monnet Action. (2332) It is necessary to provide sufficient flexibility in the formulation of this Decision to allow for appropriate adjustments in the actions of the IntegratedLifelong Learning Programme to respond to changing needs during the period 2007 to 2013, and to avoid the inappropriately detailed provisions of previous phases of Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci. (2433) In all its activities, the Community must eliminate inequalities, and promote equality, between men and women, as provided for in Article 3 of the Treaty. (2534) Further to Article 151 of the Treaty, the Community must take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of the Treaty, in particular in order to respect and to promote the diversity of its cultures.
There is a need to widen access to those from disadvantaged groups and to address actively the special learning needs of those with disabilities, in the implementation of all parts of the Programme, including through the use of higher grants to reflect the additional costs of disabled participants, and the provision of support for the learning and use of sign languages and braille. (37) Note should be taken of the achievements of the European Year of Education through Sport (2004) and of the potential educational benefits of cooperation between educational institutions and sports organisations that the Year highlighted. (2838) The candidate countries for membership of the European Union and the EFTA countries which are members of the EEA may participate in Community programmes in accordance with agreements to be signed between the Community and these countries. (2939) The European Council in Thessaloniki on 19 and 20 June 2003 approved the Council conclusions of 16 June on the Western Balkans, including its annex “The Thessaloniki Agenda for the Western Balkans: moving towards European integration”, which provides that Community programmes should be opened to the Stabilisation and Association Process countries on the basis of framework agreements to be signed between the Community and those countries. (3040) The Community and the Swiss Confederation have declared their intention of undertaking negotiations to conclude agreements in areas of common interest such as Community education, training and youth programmes. (3141) The IntegratedLifelong Learning Programme should be regularly monitored and evaluated in cooperation between the Commission and the Member States in order to allow for readjustments, particularly with respect to the priorities for implementing the measures.
This Decision shall be implemented over the period from 1 January 2007 until 31 December 2013.
