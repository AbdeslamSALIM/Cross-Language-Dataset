These objectives are underpinned by a European electronic communications regulatory framework designed to drive competition in the market, bringing investment and innovation, with choice, quality and lower prices for the consumer.
This Communication highlights market, regulatory and consumer developments in the sector in 2005 and identifies the main implementation issues that still require attention.
The regulatory situation described here is that at 1 December 2005.
Market data, unless otherwise indicated, cover the period up to 1 September 2005 (1 October 2005 in the case of broadband data). 2.
Broadband take-up has grown rapidly to nearly 53 million lines, a rise of almost 20 million during 2005.
After dipping significantly in 1999-2001, investment levels are recovering, with capital expenditure for the sector as a whole conservatively estimated to exceed €45 billion[7] in the EU in 2005, an increase of approximately 6% compared to 2004 and the third annual increase running.
Most of the larger players are present in other national markets and there has been a notable trend in investment in the new Member States by some of the more established players as well as by pan-European and local new entrants.
Fixed broadband There was a significant increase in broadband take-up in 2005, with average EU penetration (lines per 100 population) reaching 11.5% in October, compared to 7.3% in October 2004 (with average EU 15 penetration up from 8.4% to 13% over the same period).
This equates to over 52 000 new broadband lines per day across the EU, up from 38 000 per day in 2004. [pic] There are now almost 53 million fixed broadband lines in the EU.
Although this figure includes data services such as leased lines as well as broadband, this would suggest that the consumer is benefiting from lower broadband prices as volumes grow. [pic] However, growth has been uneven across the Member States, and 23 percentage points now separate the best from the worst in terms of penetration.
Mobile services Average EU penetration of mobile services reached 92.8% in October 2005, with faster growth in the EU10, of which three, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Lithuania, exceeded the notional 100% mark for the first time.
There are now 79 2G network operators in the EU, together with 214 service providers, up from 166 in 2004.
Penetration tends to be highest in countries with a greater number of service providers. [pic] By September 2005 there were around 15 million subscribers to 3G services in the EU, with most in Italy and the United Kingdom; 58 operators now offer commercial services, including internet access, content services including news and sports highlights, video telephony and downloads.
There have been significant reductions in prices to consumers for national calls in the majority of Member States, in particular for low and medium users in Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Finland and Sweden.
Fixed voice services Despite the fact that revenues in traditional fixed voice are falling at around 1.6% a year, this remains an attractive market for new entrants.
The influx of players into the market, after a slight dip between 2001 and 2003, has led to a further fall in incumbents’ market share.
The Commission considers that the cost accounting systems put in place in a number of other Member States are still underdeveloped or lack transparency.
NRA involvement It is important for market players and consumers that NRAs conduct well-ordered public consultation in relation to regulatory decisions.
Finland for example has centralized emergency centres with a maximum response time of 90 seconds.
Moreover the largest mobile operator (the second largest company ranked by foreign assets in the world) has not been taken into account, to avoid distortions. [11] EITO, 2005. [12] SMP operators. [13] Case C-109/03 KPN Telecom BV v OPTA [2004].
