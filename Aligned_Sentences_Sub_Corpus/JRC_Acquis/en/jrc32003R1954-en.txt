Council Regulation (EC) No 1954/2003 of 4 November 2003 on the management of the fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources and modifying Regulation (EC) No 2847/93 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 685/95 and (EC) No 2027/95 Council Regulation (EC) No 1954/2003 of 4 November 2003 on the management of the fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources and modifying Regulation (EC) No 2847/93 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 685/95 and (EC) No 2027/95 THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 37 and 299(2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2), Whereas: (1) Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy(3) provides that the Council shall establish Community measures governing access to waters and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities. (2) The regime of access to certain areas and resources defined in the Articles 156 to 166 and Articles 347 to 353 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal has expired on 31 December 2002.
Consequently, certain provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 685/95 of 27 March 1995, on the management of the fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources(4), and Council Regulation (EC) No 2027/95 of 15 June 1995, establishing a system for the management of fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources(5) need to be adapted to the new legal situation. (3) Other provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 685/95 and (EC) No 2027/95 are designed to establish a general system for the management of fishing effort in order to prevent an increase in fishing effort and are not related to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal.
A review of the implementation of the present scheme by December 2006 would also allow the Council to reassess the situation. (6) It is necessary for the protection of the sensitive biological situation of the waters around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands and the preservation of the local economy of these islands, having regard to their structural, social and economic situation, to limit certain fishing activities in those waters to vessels registered in the ports of these islands.
A review of these measures by December 2006 would allow the Council to reassess the situation. (7) An area to the South and West of Ireland has been identified as an area of high concentration of juvenile hake.
