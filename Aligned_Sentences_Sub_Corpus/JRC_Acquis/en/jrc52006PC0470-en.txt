Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain plastic sacks and bags originating in the People’s Republic of China and Thailand, and terminating the proceeding on imports of certain plastic sacks and bags originating in Malaysia THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community[1] (‘the basic Regulation’) and in particular Article 9 thereof, Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: A.
On 30 June 2005, pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation, the Commission announced by a notice (‘notice of initiation’) published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2] the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding with regard to imports into the Community of certain plastic sacks and bags originating in the People’s Republic of China (‘the PRC’), Malaysia and Thailand ('the countries concerned’). 4.
The proceeding was initiated as a result of a complaint lodged on 17 May 2005 by 29 Community producers of plastic sacks and bags, representing a major proportion (in this case more than 25 %) of the total Community production of plastic sacks and bags.
The Commission officially advised the complainant Community producers, their association, other Community producers, the exporting producers, importers, suppliers and users as well as user associations known to be concerned and the representatives of the exporting countries of the initiation of the proceeding.
Given the large number of known exporting producers in the PRC, Malaysia and Thailand, as well as the large number of known Community producers and importers, sampling for the determination of dumping and injury was envisaged in the notice of initiation, in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation (see below for further details regarding sampling). 8.
In order to allow exporting producers in the PRC to submit a claim for market economy treatment (‘MET’) or individual treatment (‘IT’), if they so wished, the Commission sent claim forms to the exporting producers known to be concerned and to the authorities of the PRC. 108 companies and groups requested MET pursuant to Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation.
The Commission sent questionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to all other companies that made themselves known within the deadlines set out in the notice of initiation.
In addition to questionnaire replies received from parties selected in the samples of exporters, importers and Community industry, replies to questionnaires were also received from two Community retailers. 10.
The examination of injury covered the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 March 2005 (‘period considered’).
As stated above, in view of the large number of exporting producers in the PRC, Malaysia and Thailand, sampling was proposed in the notice of initiation, in accordance with Article 17(1) of the basic Regulation. 14.
However, only 104 companies and groups from the PRC, 31 companies from Malaysia and 14 from Thailand reported exports to the Community during the investigation period. 16.
Those exporting producers that exported the said product to the Community during the investigation period and expressed a wish to participate in the sample, were considered as cooperating companies and were taken into account in the selection of the samples. 17.
The cooperating exporting producers represented around 95 % of total exports of the product concerned from the PRC to the Community, 96 % of Malaysia’s and 88 % of Thailand’s total exports. 18.
Therefore, a dumping margin will not be determined for these companies. 19.
Exporting producers which did not make themselves known within the aforesaid period were considered as not cooperating with the investigation. 20.
According to Article 17(1) of the basic Regulation, the following criteria were taken into account in the selection of the sample: size of exporting producer with regard to export sales to the Community as well as size of exporting producer with regard to domestic sales.
It was considered that for the reasons set out below, the sample should include a sufficient number of companies selling on the domestic market.
Therefore, a number of major exporting companies having representative domestic sales were included in the sample. 21.
The selected companies represented around 52 %, 62 % and 71 % of the exports of the said product to the Community from the PRC, Malaysia and Thailand respectively. 22.
In accordance with Article 17(2) of the basic Regulation, the cooperating exporting producers and the authorities of the countries concerned were given the opportunity to comment on the selection of the sample. 23.
Moreover, the basic Regulation allows limiting the investigation to the largest representative volume of exports which can reasonably be investigated within the time available. 24.
As a consequence, only the major exporting companies which also represented a major part of the domestic sales have been selected in accordance with Article 6.10 ADA and Article 17 of the basic Regulation. 25.
During the investigation, it was found that Wuxi Jiayihe Packaging Co., Ltd.
and Wuxi Bestpac Packaging Co., Ltd.
As the information about this reporting mistake was received in a timely manner, the Commission agreed to include that company in the sample, replacing one of the companies previously selected which had a smaller volume of export sales. 27.
In view of the large number of countries and parties involved and the time constraints, the Commission concluded that no individual examination of exporting producers, with a view to the application of Articles 9(6) and 17(3) of the basic Regulation, could be granted because this would be unduly burdensome and would prevent completion of the investigation in good time.
In accordance with Article 17(2) of the basic Regulation, the association of Community producers was consulted and raised no objection.
On the basis of the information received, the Commission selected five importers in three Member States, two in France, one in Germany and two in the United Kingdom.
These importers represented the largest representative volume of sales of known importers in the Community (around 9 %), which could be reasonably investigated within the time available.
Two importers finally cooperated and sent questionnaire replies. 36.
The product concerned 42.
The product concerned falls within CN codes ex 3923 21 00, ex 3923 29 10 and ex 3923 29 90. 43.
Consequently, all different types of plastic bags, falling within CN codes ex 3923 21 00, ex 3923 29 10 and ex 3923 29 90 originating in the PRC, Malaysia and Thailand are regarded as one single product for the purpose of the present investigation. 48.
Like product 49.
The Commission found that plastic bags produced and sold on the respective domestic markets in the PRC, Malaysia (which also served as an analogue country) and Thailand and those exported to the Community from the countries concerned, as well as those produced and sold in the Community by the Community industry, have the same physical, chemical and technical characteristics and uses.
It is therefore concluded that all are like products within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.
General methodology 51.
Normal value 53.
Domestic sales of a particular product type were considered as sufficiently representative when the volume of that product type sold on the domestic market to independent customers during the investigation period represented 5 % or more of the total volume of the comparable product type sold for export to the Community. 56.
The Commission subsequently examined whether the domestic sales of each type of plastic bag sold domestically in representative quantities by each company in each exporting country could be considered as being made in the ordinary course of trade pursuant to Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation.
Where the sales volume of a product type, sold at a net sales price equal to or above the calculated cost of production, represented more than 80 % of the total sales volume of that type, and where the weighted average price of that type was equal to or above the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price.
This price was calculated as a weighted average of the prices of all domestic sales of that type made during the IP, irrespective of whether these sales were profitable or not. 58.
Where the volume of profitable sales of a product type represented 80 % or less of the total sales volume of that type, or where the weighted average price of that type was below the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of profitable sales of that type only, provided that these sales represented 10 % or more of the total sales volume of that type. 59.
Where the volume of profitable sales of any product type represented less than 10 % of the total sales volume of that type, it was considered that this particular type was sold in insufficient quantities for the domestic price to provide an appropriate basis for the establishment of the normal value. 60.
In this regard, the Commission used constructed normal value, in accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation. 61.
Export price 64.
In all cases where the product concerned was exported to independent customers in the Community, the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, namely on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable. 65.
Where the export sale was made via related importers based in the Community, the export price was constructed, pursuant to Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the price at which the imported products were first resold to an independent buyer, duly adjusted for all costs incurred between importation and resale, as well as a reasonable margin for SG%amp%A and profits.
Dumping margins 70.
Pursuant to Articles 2(11) and (12) of the basic Regulation dumping margins were established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value by product type with a weighted average export price by product type as established above. 71.
The dumping margin for cooperating exporting producers, which made themselves known in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation, but were not part of the sample, has been established on the basis of the weighted average of the dumping margins of the companies in the sample pursuant to Article 9(6) of the basic Regulation. 72.
It has been the consistent practice of the Commission to consider related exporting producers or exporting producers belonging to the same group as one single entity for the determination of a dumping margin and thus to establish one single dumping margin for them.
This is in particular because calculating individual dumping margins might encourage circumvention of anti-dumping measures, thus rendering them ineffective, by enabling related exporting producers to channel their exports to the Community through the company with the lowest individual dumping margin. 73.
In accordance with this practice, the related exporting producers belonging to the same groups were regarded as one single entity and attributed one single dumping margin which was calculated on the basis the weighted average of the dumping margins of the cooperating producers in the respective groups. 74.
In order to determine the dumping margin for non-cooperating exporting producers, the level of non-cooperation was first established.
To this end, the volume of exports to the Community reported by the cooperating exporting producers was compared with the equivalent Eurostat import statistics. 75.
As the level of cooperation in Malaysia and Thailand was high (above 85 %) it was considered appropriate to set the residual dumping margin for any non-cooperating exporting producers in each of these countries concerned at the level of the highest duty imposed on a co-operating exporter. 76.
As regards China, it should be noted that although overall cooperation was high, three exporting producers provided false and misleading information and were thus declared non-cooperating according to Article 18 of the basic Regulation as described below.
As these companies deliberately abstained from cooperation, the residual dumping margin for any non-cooperating exporting producer in the PRC was based on facts available.
Normal value 79.
For the three companies without representative domestic sales, normal value also had to be constructed in accordance with the methodology set out above. 80.
For the three companies with representative domestic sales, their profit made in the ordinary course of trade was used to construct their normal value, as well as domestic SG%amp%A based on their own domestic sales. 81.
Export price 84.
The six exporting producers made export sales to the Community either directly to independent customers or through related trading companies located in the Community and Indonesia.
Where the export sale was made via related importers based in the Community, the export price was constructed, pursuant to Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation, as set out in recital (53) above. 85.
The normal value and export prices were compared on an ex-works basis, as described in recitals (54)and (55) above, with adjustments, where appropriate, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. 87.
For the sales channelled through Indonesia, an adjustment of 3.3 % for commissions was applied in accordance with Article 2(10)(i) of the basic Regulation.
Given that the profit of the Indonesian company was influenced by sales between related companies, the 3 % profit margin was determined on the basis of that achieved by an unrelated trader. 88.
Dumping margins 90.
The dumping margins, expressed as a percentage of the CIF import price at the Community border, duty unpaid, are the following: Dragonpak Industries (M) S/B, Johor Bahru | 0 % | Europlastics Malaysia S/B, Shah Alam | 0 % | Hond Tat Industries S/B, Klang | 4,0 % | Plastic V S/B, Klang | 0 % | Poly Carrier Industries S/B, Klang | 0 % | Sido Bangun S/B, Negri Sembilan | 9,1 % | Cooperating exporting producers not in the sample | 7,3 % | All other companies | 9,1 % | 91.
The Commission examined whether the country-wide level of dumping for Malaysia could be shown to be above the de minimis 2 % level as provided in Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation.
The amount of dumping in the sample, expressed as a percentage of the CIF value of exports of the sample, was below 2 %.
Therefore the overall dumping margin established for Malaysia was below the de minimis level.
The Community industry argued that Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation does not provide for the determination of a country-wide de minimis dumping margin. 93.
Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation clearly states that a proceeding must be terminated where the margin of dumping is less than 2 %.
The Community industry also argued that Article 9(6) of the basic Regulation provides that zero and de minimis margins should be disregarded when calculating the dumping duty applicable to cooperating exporting producers outside the sample.
Normal value 97.
For the companies without representative domestic sales, normal value also had to be constructed in accordance with the methodology set out above. 98.
For two of the companies with representative domestic sales, profit made in the ordinary course of trade was used.
For the third company with representative domestic sales, their own profit could not be used as less than 10 % of the sales were made in the ordinary course of trade. 100.
Since no Thai exporter had overall profitable domestic sales, a reasonable profit margin, based on the profit of one Thai company on the sales in the domestic market of the same general category of products was used to construct normal value for the two companies with no domestic sales, and for the one company having less than 10 % of domestic sales made in the ordinary course of trade, in accordance with Article 2(6)(c) of the basic Regulation. 101.
Export price 102.
The exports of the five cooperating exporting producers were made directly to independent customers in the Community.
Comparison 104.
The normal value and export prices were compared on an ex-works basis, as described above, with adjustments, where appropriate, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. 105.
Dumping margins 106.
In anti-dumping investigations concerning imports originating in the PRC, normal value shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 6 of Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation for those exporting producers which were found to meet the criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c).
It has been concluded that of the ten Chinese exporting producers investigated, seven have demonstrated that they fulfil the five criteria of Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, and should therefore be granted MET, while it was determined for one exporting producer that it should not be granted MET. 117.
Furthermore, for the two remaining Chinese exporting producers investigated and one exporting producer not selected in the sample, it was found that they provided false and misleading information within the meaning of Article 18 of the basic Regulation. 118.
Therefore, in cases where a subsidiary or any other related company is a producer and/or a seller of the product concerned, all such related companies have to be declared as being related to ensure that the related companies receive one dumping margin, should measures be imposed.
All related producers would also have to reply to the questionnaire. 120.
The information submitted to the Commission did thus not allow for proper investigation of all the related companies in the group.
The above means that the company’s claim for individual treatment (‘IT’) was also rejected as the company failed the criteria set out in Article 9(5)(b), namely that export prices and quantities were freely determined. 126.
Therefore the second criterion for MET cannot be considered to be fulfilled. 127.
Therefore the third criterion for MET cannot be considered to be fulfilled given that the company has not demonstrated that there are no distortions carried over from the former non-market economy system in relation to land use rights and the acquisition of the factory buildings. 128.
The company also substantiated its decision not to sell in the domestic market in the period up to and including the IP by providing evidence that this decision was taken exclusively in view of the situation of the company and its market prospects, and was therefore, despite the export sales requirement in the business licence, in effect, free from State interference.
Therefore, it was considered reasonable to apply equally to all non-sampled companies the weighted average margin resulting from all the companies selected for the sample, according to the criteria set out in recital (17), with no distinction being made between companies obtaining MET/IT or not. 135.
The Community industry also argued that the fact that the company’s business license contained during the IP a minimum export requirement is incompatible with the first MET criterion.
However, this company sold the product concerned on the Chinese domestic market both before and during the IP.
The evidence was presented to the company, which contested the view that this was sufficient to consider the company not cooperating with the investigation under Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
Normal value 147.
For the remaining four companies without representative domestic sales, normal value also had to be constructed in accordance with the methodology set out above. 149.
For the three companies with representative domestic sales, their profit made in the ordinary course of trade was used, as well as domestic SG%amp%A based on their own domestic sales. 150.
Analogue country 154.
According to Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, in economies in transition normal value for exporting producers not granted MET has to be established on the basis of the price or constructed value in an analogue country. 155.
Only one company in the United States and two companies in India indicated their willingness to cooperate, but no questionnaire replies were received from any of these producers. 157.
The investigation established that significant domestic sales in the ordinary course of trade were made by three cooperating sampled exporting producers in Malaysia. 158.
Following the disclosure of the Commission information document which proposed Malaysia as analogue country, the Community industry argued that the Commission should use the USA as an analogue country, given the small domestic market in Malaysia and the high import duties in force compared to those of the United States. 159.
This argument was rejected given the significant domestic sales in Malaysia of the product concerned.
Furthermore, it was found, that, while the import duties in Malaysia were high (30 %), imports from ASEAN countries, which were significant, benefited from a preferential rate (5 %) that was in line with duties in the USA.
Given the lack of cooperation from companies in the USA, India and Indonesia, and the finding of no dumping from Malaysia, it was decided to use Malaysia as analogue country for the PRC. 161.
Normal value 162.
Where necessary, those prices were adjusted so as to ensure a fair comparison with those product types exported to the Community by the Chinese producer concerned. 163.
As a result, normal value was established as the weighted average domestic sales price, in the ordinary course of trade, to unrelated customers by the cooperating producers in Malaysia with representative domestic sales. 164.
Export price 165.
The Chinese exporting producers made export sales to the Community either directly to independent customers or through trading companies located in Hong Kong and the Community.
For the sales channelled through related sales companies in Hong Kong, an adjustment for commissions was applied in accordance with Article 2(10)(i) of the basic Regulation where it was shown that these related sales companies performed the duties of a commission agent.
Comparison 167.
The normal value and export prices were compared on an ex-works basis, as described above, with adjustments, where appropriate, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. 168.
One Chinese exporting producer claimed an adjustment under Article 2(10)(d) of the basic Regulation, corresponding to the market value of the difference in levels of trade between the export sales and some of the sales in the domestic market.
However, the amounts claimed by the company could not be supported through the corresponding difference in price levels in the domestic market and the adjustment was therefore not granted. 169.
Dumping margins 170.
The dumping margins, expressed as a percentage of the CIF import price at the Community border, duty unpaid, are the following: Cedo (Shanghai) Limited and Cedo (Shanghai) Household Wrappings Co., Ltd., Shanghai | 7,4 % | Chun Yip Plastics (Shenzhen) Ltd., Shenzhen | 14,8 % | Huizhou Jun Yang Plastics Co., Ltd., Huizhou | 4,8 % | Jinguan (Longhai) Plastics Packing Co., Ltd., Longhai | 5,1 % | Sunway Kordis (Shanghai) Ltd.
Community production 173.
In calculating Community production, during the IP, the estimated Community consumption estimated as explained in recitals (158) to (159) below was taken as a starting point.
This quantity was subsequently reduced with the production quantities of the companies not included in the definition of Community industry as referred to in recital (153) below.
The calculation resulted in a total Community production of 1 175 000 tonnes. 175.
Certain exporting producers, importers and retailers argued that the percentage of the Community industry's production in relation to the total Community production was below 25 %, and therefore the proceeding should be terminated due to the lack of support for the case.
AMI provides certain information concerning the polyethylene film industry in its following two reports referred to by certain parties: 177.
Polyethylene film extruders, 6th edition (ISBN 1 904188 12 5), and 178.
Polyethylene film industry in Europe, 7th edition (and ISBN 1 904188 17 6) 179.
It should be noted that, in the “Publisher’s notice” to these reports, AMI mentions that “no legal responsibility is accepted for any errors or omissions in that information, whether such errors or omissions result from negligence, accident or any other cause, and no responsibility is accepted with regard to the standing of any firms and companies mentioned”.
It should also be noted that, whereas AMI provides certain information concerning the polyethylene film industry in the two above-mentioned reports, it does not present any estimation of the market size of the product under investigation in the Community as such.
The AMI reports estimate the end use applications of extruded polyethylene film as follows[4]: Product group | % of end use applications of polyethylene film | (i) Coex/laminating film | 8,2 % | (ii) Other film | 6,8 % | (iii) Shrink film | 13,8 % | (iv) Stretch film | 14,4 % | (v) Agriculture/building | 8,0 % | (vi) Film on the reel | 15,3 % | (vii) Heavy duty sacks | 7,5 % | (ix) Refuse sacks | 5,8 % | (x) Shoppers | 8,3 % | (xi) Other bags/sacks | 11,9 % | TOTAL | 100 % | 181.
It is estimated in the reports that the consumption of polyethylene for film extrusion in Europe, as defined in recital (139) below, would have been 7 699 000 tonnes in 2004.
AMI expresses all production figures as percentages representing end use applications of consumption of polyethylene for film extrusion in Europe.
The quantities referred to below have, therefore, been calculated by using this range of consumption. 184.
The parties referred to in recital (134) argued that categories (vi), (ix), (x) and (xi) of the categories listed above in recital (137) should be included in the product under investigation in part or in full. 185.
It seems clear that the category “shoppers” would fall in the product under investigation based on their physical characteristics representing 8,3 % (i.e.
Certain parties alleged that up to 65 % of the category called “film on the reel” representing 15,3 %[7] of the total end uses) would fall under the definition of the product under investigation.
Moreover, the on-spot verifications carried out in the course of the investigation at the premises of seven production plants of five Community producers in two countries showed that film on the reel, extruded externally, was not used in the production of the like product.
Furthermore, the verification visits carried out at the premises of 21 exporting producers in the three countries concerned gave no support to the claim that film on the reel, extruded externally, would be used in the production of the product concerned.
Based on the above, the argument that a large part of the category “film on the reel” should be included in the production of the like product in the Community had to be rejected. 187.
It was also claimed by some parties that the end use application defined in the report as “other bags/sacks”, representing 11,9 %[8] of the total end uses, should be included in the Community production figures.
This category is reported as “other film” in “AMI’s guide to the polyethylene industry in Europe” in its country specific production figures and is not defined as bags or sacks on this level.
This product is not sold as bags or sacks nor do imports of this product fall within CN codes 3923 21 00, 3923 29 10 and 3923 29 90.
The resulting production in this group would thus be in the range from 363 000 to 387 000 tonnes. 188.
In this regard, it is to be noted that industrial waste is already included in the production figures when used as virgin material and thus any inclusion of this quantity in the production would result in double counting.
Based on the information received from interested parties this could amount to 20 % of the production of these bags.
Therefore, a corresponding adjustment of 20 % was made in the quantity of refuse sacks resulting in additional production of the product concerned in the range from 88 000 to 94 000 tonnes. 189.
To arrive at the Community production, the production of companies excluded from the Community industry representing 119 000 tonnes of production should be subtracted from the above figures.
This results in a Community production in the range from 1 193 000 to 1 279 000 tonnes of production of the product under investigation.
The estimate of the Community production at initiation of the proceeding of 1 240 000 tonnes falls within the range of this calculation and the 25 % threshold concerning the support to the case is fulfilled to the upper limit of the range. 191.
The above analysis clearly shows that the information referred to by certain parties mentioned above in recital (134) is not such as to undermine the estimate of the Community production of the product under investigation prepared by the Commission which is referred to in recital (150) below. 192.
At initiation stage, the accumulated production of the 29 complaining Community producers represented 331 500 tonnes, i.e. 26,7 % in relation to the total Community production of 1 240 000 tonnes measured at the stage of initiation.
In addition, it is noted that another 21 companies with a total production of 302 000 tonnes supported the complaint at initiation stage.
Thus, in total the complaint was supported by Community producers representing more than 50 % in relation to the total Community production of 1 240 000 tonnes. 196.
A fourth company, which opposed the proceeding and which did not cooperate with the investigation as a Community producer, was also excluded from the definition of the Community industry as it had a related exporting producer in one of the countries concerned and it imported significant volumes of the product concerned into the Community in relation to its production in the Community. 198.
Certain parties claimed that the company opposing the proceeding, British Polyethylene Industries plc (‘BPI’), had been excluded from the definition of the Community industry and thereby from the total Community production, whereas another company supporting the proceeding, Cedo Ltd., had been included, even though both companies had a similar situation having production both in the Community and in the countries concerned.
Certain parties argued that two of sampled Community producers should be excluded from the definition of the Community industry as they imported considerable quantities of the product concerned originating in the PRC and Thailand.
The 24 complaining Community producers and the seven other producers having cooperated with the investigation are therefore deemed to constitute the Community industry within the meaning of Articles 4(1) and 5(4) of the basic Regulation.
Overall these companies represent approximately 358 000 tonnes or 31 % of the Community production measured during the investigation. 201.
It is noted that another nine companies, representing 57 000 tonnes of production expressed their support to the investigation, however, these companies did not manage to co-operate fully with the investigation and were thus not included in the definition of the Community industry. 202.
The apparent Community consumption was established on the basis of data reported in the complaint lodged by the complainant.
Based on the above analysis, the Community consumption increased throughout the period considered by 6 % from the beginning of the period considered, i.e.
Detailed data, expressed in tonnes is as follows: Consumption | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | 1000 tonnes | 1 582 | 1 618 | 1 653 | 1 670 | 1 674 | Index | 100 | 102 | 104 | 105 | 106 | Source: Complaint | 205.
The Commission examined whether imports of certain plastic sacks and bags originating in the countries concerned should be assessed cumulatively in accordance with Article 3(4) of the basic Regulation.
This Article provides that the effects of imports from two or more countries simultaneously subject to anti-dumping investigations are to be assessed cumulatively only if it is determined that (a) the margin of dumping established in relation to the imports from each country is more than de minimis as defined in Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation and that the volume of imports of each country is not negligible and (b) a cumulative assessment is appropriate in the light of the conditions of competition between imported products and the conditions of competition between the imported products and the like Community product. 208.
As the overall dumping margin for Malaysia was found to be below 2 %, i.e.
In that regard, the dumping margins established in relation to the imports originating in the PRC and in Thailand were found to be above the de minimis level of 2 % set forth in Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation.
Furthermore, since during the IP imports from the PRC represented a market share of 14,4 % and imports from Thailand a market share of 4 %, the volumes of imports from the PRC and Thailand were not negligible. 209.
Moreover, it is recalled that the imported product was found to be alike to plastic sacks and bags produced in the Community and as such competes with them under the same conditions of competition. 210.
In the light of the above, it is considered that all the criteria set out in Article 3(4) of the basic Regulation were met and that imports from the PRC and Thailand should therefore be examined cumulatively. 211.
Volume of the imports concerned and market share 212.
The volume of dumped imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC and Thailand as reported by Eurostat increased from approximately 219 000 tonnes in 2001 to 307 000 tonnes in the IP representing an increase of 40 %.
The sharp increase in imports over the period concerned has absorbed 96 % of the increase in consumption that occurred in the Community market over the same period. 213.
All imports of the product concerned were declared under CN code ex 3923 21 00 (sacks and bags of polymers of ethylene).
Imports under CN codes ex 3923 29 10 (sacks and bags of polyvinyl chloride) and ex 3923 29 90 (sacks and bags of other plastics) were not included in the calculation, as according to the available information there was no production of sacks and bags where polyethylene does not predominate by weight, and, consequently, there are currently no imports of the product concerned under these CN codes.
Cumulated imports | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | in 1000 tonnes | 219 | 239 | 288 | 299 | 307 | Index | 100 | 109 | 132 | 137 | 140 | 214.
During the period considered, the dumped imports originating in the PRC and Thailand increased their share of the Community market by 33 % from 13,8 % in 2001 to 18,3 % in the IP.
Market share | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Cumulated | 13,8 % | 14,8 % | 17,4 % | 18,0 % | 18,3 % | Index | 100 | 107 | 126 | 130 | 133 | 215.
This information showed that between 2001 and the IP, the average CIF prices of imports originating in the PRC and Thailand decreased by 14 %.
However, they did not reach the price level of 2001 and 2002 and remained on a low level.
Prices of imports in euro/kg | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Cumulated | 1,42 | 1,25 | 1,09 | 1,16 | 1,22 | Index | 100 | 88 | 77 | 82 | 86 | 217.
For the determination of the price undercutting of the imports concerned, the Commission based its analysis on the information submitted in the course of the investigation by the sampled exporting producers and the sampled Community producers.
This comparison showed that during the IP, based on product types as defined in the questionnaire and on a weighted average basis, the products concerned originating in the countries concerned were sold in the Community at prices which undercut the Community industry's prices, when expressed as a percentage of the latter, between 4,1 % to 37,9 % for the PRC and Thailand. 219.
Preliminary remarks 221.
This analysis was carried out for the sampled companies as mentioned above.
Therefore, injury factors such as market share, sales volume, employment, production capacity, inventories and production have been established for the full Community industry. 222.
The Community industry's production capacity increased during the period considered by 66 000 tonnes or by 17 %.
Over the same period production only increased by 9 %.
Consequently, the capacity utilisation rate of the Community industry decreased by 6 %.
Production 1000 tonnes | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Production | 328 | 346 | 353 | 359 | 358 | Index | 100 | 105 | 107 | 109 | 109 | Production capacity | 399 | 423 | 444 | 463 | 465 | Index | 100 | 106 | 111 | 116 | 117 | Capacity utilisation % | 82 | 82 | 80 | 78 | 77 | Index | 100 | 99 | 97 | 94 | 94 | Source: Questionnaire replies of the Community industry. | 224.
Accordingly, data from these companies had to be excluded when carrying out the analysis of stocks for the period considered.
Stocks | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Tonnes | 24 110 | 26 446 | 26 757 | 25 016 | 28 994 | Index | 100 | 110 | 111 | 104 | 120 | Source: Questionnaire replies of the Community industry. | 226.
During the IP, inventories of finished products represented around 8 % of the Community industry’s total production volume.
The level of closing stocks of the Community industry first increased by 11 % in 2003 and then marked a decrease of 7 percentage points in 2004, before rising by to 20 percentage points in the IP compared to 2001. 227.
Sales volume, market share and growth 228.
Sales volume | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | tonnes | 308 068 | 330 103 | 334 818 | 341 701 | 338 940 | Index | 100 | 107 | 109 | 111 | 110 | Source: Questionnaire replies of the Community industry. | 229.
The market share of the Community industry has increased by 4 % over the period considered.
After a first increase of 5 % between 2001 and 2002, it remained unchanged until 2004 and showed a slight decrease in the IP.
At the same time Community consumption increased by 6 % over the period considered.
Therefore, the Community industry was able to take advantage of the growth of the market between 2001 and the IP.
Market share | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | % | 19,5 % | 20,4 % | 20,3 % | 20,5 % | 20,2 % | Index | 100 | 105 | 104 | 105 | 104 | Source: Questionnaire replies of the Community industry. | 230.
The level of employment of the Community industry decreased over the period considered by 1 %.
Over the same period, its productivity, measured as output per person employed per year, increased by 10 %. 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Number of employees | 3 325 | 3 353 | 3 381 | 3 338 | 3 302 | Index | 100 | 101 | 102 | 100 | 99 | Productivity: production per employee | 99 | 103 | 104 | 108 | 108 | Index | 100 | 104 | 105 | 109 | 109 | Source: Questionnaire replies of the Community industry. | 232.
Over the period considered the total annual cost of labour per employee increased by 7 %.
After an increase of 8 % between 2001 and 2004, the average wage decreased by 1 % between 2004 and the IP. 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Total labour cost per employee in euro | 32 801 | 34 507 | 34 794 | 35 533 | 35 217 | Index | 100 | 105 | 106 | 108 | 107 | Source: Questionnaire replies of the sampled Community industry. | 233.
Sales prices 234.
The sampled Community industry producers' average net sales price decreased from 1,50 euro per kg in 2001 to 1,47 euro per kg in the IP.
Prices first decreased by 4 % in 2002 and by a further 2 % in 2003.
Between 2003 and 2004 they showed a slight increase of 0,7 % and increased further by 3,5 % in the IP.
This rather stable price development should be seen in the light of the development of raw material prices which increased considerably, i.e.
Profitability 236.
During the period considered the profitability of the sampled Community industry producers' sales in the Community to unrelated customers fell by 82 %.
However, between 2002 and the IP profitability showed a continuous strong decrease, reaching only 1,1 % in the IP, while several of the sampled companies recorded losses. 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Profitability | 6,3 % | 6,9 % | 4,0 % | 2,5 % | 1,1 % | Index | 100 | 110 | 63 | 40 | 17 | Source: Questionnaire replies of the sampled Community industry. | 237.
The Community industry's annual investment in the production of the like product declined by 30 % during the period considered from approximately 16 million euro to less than 12 million euro. 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Investments (1000 euro) | 16 474 | 20 956 | 11 363 | 16 830 | 11 507 | Index | 100 | 127 | 69 | 102 | 70 | Source: Questionnaire replies of the sampled Community industry. | 239.
The sampled Community industry producers' return on investment, which expresses their pre-tax result as a percentage of the average opening and closing net book value of assets employed in the production of the like product, decreased dramatically as a result of decreasing profitability.
Whereas the return on investment remained stable between 2001 and 2002, it thereafter declined sharply to 6 % in the IP representing an overall decrease of 84 % between 2001 and the IP. 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Return on Investment % | 37 % | 37 % | 20 % | 12 % | 6 % | Index | 100 | 100 | 54 | 32 | 16 | Source: Questionnaire replies of the sampled Community industry. | 240.
However, when expressed as a percentage of turnover, the net cash inflow showed a marked decline in percentage terms, especially during the IP, in line with the decrease in profitability. 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Cash flow (in 1000 euro) | 14 965 | 23 307 | 17 652 | 17 598 | 4 706 | Index | 100 | 156 | 118 | 118 | 31 | Source: Questionnaire replies of the sampled Community industry. | 242.
As concerns the impact on the Community industry of the magnitude of the actual margin of dumping, given the volume and the prices of the imports from the PRC and Thailand, this impact is substantial. 248.
Moreover, in the IP, the sales prices of the Community industry were substantially undercut (from 4,1 % to 37,9 %) by those of the imports of the product concerned.
The Community industry suffered a dramatic decline of 5,2 percentage points in profitability to reach close to break even level in the IP.
Its return on investment decreased at the same time by 31 percentage points and there was a significant decrease of 69 % in its cash-flow.
Moreover its capacity utilisation decreased by 5 %, its sales prices decreased by 2 %, employment decreased by 1 %, closing stocks increased by 20 %, its investment decreased by 30 % and its ability to raise capital gradually deteriorated. 251.
The Community industry increased its capacity by acquiring production assets from the companies subject to these shut-downs. 252.
In the light of the foregoing, it is concluded that the Community industry is in a difficult economic and financial situation and has suffered material injury, within the meaning of Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation.
In accordance with Articles 3(6) and 3(7) of the basic Regulation, the Commission examined whether the dumped imports originating in Thailand and the PRC have caused injury to the Community industry to a degree that may be considered as material.
Known factors other than the dumped imports, which could at the same time have injured the Community industry, were also examined to ensure that the possible injury caused by these other factors was not attributed to the dumped imports. 255.
Between 2001 and the IP, dumped imports originating in the PRC and Thailand increased by 40 % in volume.
At the same time the market share of these imports increased from 13,8 % in 2001 to 18,3 % in the IP.
The substantial increase in volume of the imports at very low and dumped prices and their gain in market share over the period considered coincided with the deterioration of the situation of the Community industry during the same period, in particular in terms profitability, sales prices, closing stocks, investment, capacity utilisation, cash flow, ability to raise capital and return on investment. 259.
It is therefore concluded that the pressure exerted by the imports concerned, played a determining role in the injurious situation of the Community industry. 260.
Effect of other factors 261.
Performance of other Community producers 262.
As regards the sales volumes of the other Community producers, they decreased by 7,1 % in terms of volume between 2001 and the IP and decreased by 7,8 % in terms of market share during the same period.
No indication was found that the prices of other Community producers were lower than those of the cooperating Community industry, or that their overall situation would be different.
Therefore, it is concluded that the products produced and sold by the other Community producers did not contribute to the injury suffered by the Community industry. 263.
According to information derived from Eurostat, the volume of imports originating in other third countries (e.g.
This corresponds to a market share of 13,8 %.
However, it is to be noted that the average price of these imports was above that of the imports originating in the PRC and Thailand during the IP and even slightly higher than that of the Community Industry.
It is therefore concluded that imports from other third countries have not materially contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry. 265.
Raw material prices 266.
However, the evolution of the polyethylene prices reveals that the raw material prices in Asia fluctuated both below and above the corresponding European prices during the period considered.
Based on the figures presented by these parties concerning the situation in the PRC, the average price differential in raw materials in the PRC compared to the EU decreased from 20,3 % to 12,3 % between 2001 and 2004 whilst at the same time the average price differential in the final product increased from 0,7 % to 14,8 %.
As the development of prices of the raw material should have led to a decrease in the price differential of the final product rather than an increase in this price differential, the investigation showed that there was no logical correlation between the development of the raw material price and the price of the final product exported to the Community.
On the contrary, the Community industry was in relatively good shape in 2001 although the price differential was at its highest, and showed an injurious situation in 2004 and the IP when the price differential was much smaller.
Therefore, it must be concluded that the differential in the raw material prices cannot be considered to have contributed to the material injury of the Community industry in a significant way. 267.
Some parties further alleged that the injury suffered by the Community industry was not caused by the dumped imports but by the increase in the polyethylene prices during the period considered in the Community.
Under these circumstances it has to be concluded that the Community industry has been exposed to heavy price pressure by these dumped imports and consequently has had no possibility to compensate for the increase in the raw material prices by increasing their sales prices respectively. 268.
The above is also confirmed by the wording of Article 3(7) of the basic Regulation, which refers to known factors other than dumped imports.
Equally on this basis, the arguments concerning the raw material prices are rejected. 271.
The injurious situation of the Community industry coincided with a sharp increase in imports from the PRC and Thailand and a substantial price undercutting by these imports. 273.
As to the imports from other third countries, in view of their lower market share during the IP than that of the imports concerned, and especially in view of the higher average price than that of the imports concerned during the IP and, even more important, higher than that of the Community industry, it is concluded that the effect of these other factors could not have materially contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry.
Furthermore, the effect of the differential in raw material prices in the Community and the countries concerned on the Community industry's negative developments in terms of profitability, performance and decrease in market share was negligible and in fact should have contributed positively to the situation of the Community industry. 274.
In accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether, despite the conclusion on injurious dumping, compelling reasons existed for concluding that it is not in the Community interest to adopt measures in this particular case.
The impact of possible measures on all parties involved in this proceeding and also the consequences of not taking measures were considered. 278.
The Community industry is a competitive and viable industry which is evidenced by its situation in 2001 where it was in a relatively good shape despite sharp world-wide competition.
Thus, the imposition of measures should allow it to increase market share and its sales prices, and thereby reach reasonable profit levels necessary to improve the industry’s financial situation.
The 3 300 direct jobs in the co-operating Community industry would be put at stake.
The total Community production of sacks and bags involves approximately 12 000 jobs which are mainly in small and medium sized companies.
Accordingly, it is concluded that the imposition of anti-dumping measures would allow the Community industry to recover from the effects of injurious dumping suffered and that it therefore is in the interest of the Community industry. 282.
The Commission sent questionnaires to four sampled importers/traders representing 9 % of total sales of imports from the countries concerned.
However, only two importers/traders, representing 3 % of total imports from the countries concerned, replied to the questionnaire.
The cooperating unrelated importers submitted that, were measures imposed, the sales price of the product concerned would rise and that the consumers would have to pay more for the product concerned and that the effect of the duty would thus be transferred to the consumers.
Therefore, there would be a limited negative impact on the unrelated importers in this regard. 284.
Certain types of the product, such as grocery bags and carrier bags are distributed for free to individual customers in some countries in the Community whereas certain other types, such as freezer bags, nappy bags and bin liners, are sold to the customers.
Some retailers put forward that a duty of 10 % would generate a supplemental cost of 220 million euro per annum for the retail sector alone.
Based on the investigation, as the total customs value of the imports concerned is around 375 million euro, the maximum effect of an average duty of 10 % would be 38 million euros on an annual basis across the Community.
In this regard it should firstly be noted with regard to the supply of sacks and bags that the imposition of anti-dumping measures would not stop the supply of the product from the countries concerned but would only restore a level playing field in the market.
Interest of consumers 289.
Some importers argued that the imposition of anti-dumping measures would lead to a rise in the prices charged to the final customer as the level of sales prices would be adjusted in accordance with the duties. 291.
An average duty of 10 % would increase the price of each imported bag on an average basis by 0,086 cents and the price of each bag sold in the Community by 0,016 cents (assuming a hypothetical weight of 7g per bag).
This taken with the large number of producers in the Community and imports from other third countries will ensure that users and retailers will continue to have a wide choice of different suppliers of the like product at reasonable prices. 295.
Conclusion on Community interest 297.
The imposition of measures on imports of certain plastic sacks and bags originating in the People’s Republic of China and Thailand would clearly be in the interest of the Community industry.
In view of the above, it is concluded that there are no compelling reasons not to impose anti-dumping duties against imports of certain plastic sacks and bags originating in the People’s Republic of China and Thailand.
DEFINITIVE MEASURES 299.
In view of the conclusions reached with regard to dumping, resulting injury and Community interest, and in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, definitive anti-dumping measures should be imposed on imports originating in the People’s Republic of China and Thailand in order to prevent further injury being caused to the Community industry by the dumped imports. 300.
The measures should be imposed at a level sufficient to eliminate the injury caused by these imports without exceeding the dumping margin found.
The pre-tax profit margin used for this calculation was 6 % of turnover of the sales of the like product representing a healthy profit level attributable to the industry under normal conditions of competition, which was attained by the industry before the surge of the dumped imports. 301.
Any claim requesting the addition of a new exporting producer in the PRC or Thailand to the lists set out in Annexes I or II of the Regulation should be addressed to the Commission forthwith with all relevant information, in particular the evidence that the company concerned fulfils the three criteria set out in Article 2 of the Regulation.
