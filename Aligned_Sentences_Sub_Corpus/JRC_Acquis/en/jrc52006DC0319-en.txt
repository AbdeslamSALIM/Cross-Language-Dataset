The Commission launched a public debate on future policy by holding a Wine Seminar with stakeholders on 16 February 2006.
current situation and mid-term forecast for the wine market Since 1975/76, the European problem of overproduction has been addressed by a policy of limiting production potential, and encouraging the permanent abandonment of production areas, contributing to a decrease from 4.5 million ha in 1976 to 3.2 million ha in 2005.
Wine production [8] in the last five wine years varied between 166 and 196 million hl for the EU-25.
The volume of wine exported from the Community has been increasing since 1996 but at a much slower rate than imports, to reach about 13.2 million hl in 2005.
The mid-term outlook for the EU wine sector until 2010/2011, under the assumption that the wine CMO is unchanged and on the basis of the expected trends in production, consumption and trade dynamics, is that excess wine production will increase up to 27 million hl (15% of production), or to 15 million hl (8.4% of production), if the quantities distilled with aid to the potable alcohol sector are not considered surplus.
The planting rights restrictions, including a ban on new plantings, are valid until 31 July 2010.
The aim is to grub up 400 000 ha in the EU over a five-year period with a maximum total aid of about EUR 2 400 million.
Promotion and information Several stakeholders, in particular during the 16 February Seminar, underlined the need for increased emphasis on wine marketing.
If the rules are not observed, the Commission will (continue to) take appropriate measures in the framework of the clearance of accounts procedures or, if necessary, initiate infringement procedures under Article 226 of the Treaty. 8.
With this Communication the Commission invites all stakeholders to participate in an open debate on the future wine CMO, which will assist it in drafting proposals before the end of this year.
