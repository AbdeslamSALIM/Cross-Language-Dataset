Proposal for a Council Decision on a Community position in the EC-Bulgaria Association Council on the amendment of Article 3 of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Bulgaria, of the other part, with regard to an extension of the period laid down in Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement /* COM/2006/0772 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 7.12.2006 COM(2006) 772 final Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION on a Community position in the EC-Bulgaria Association Council on the amendment of Article 3 of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Bulgaria, of the other part, with regard to an extension of the period laid down in Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
Until the date of accession, the process of restructuring of the Bulgarian steel industry is regulated by Protocol 2 of the Europe Agreement with the Bulgarian Government[1].
Under the terms of the Additional Protocol the extension is subject to fulfilment of a number of conditions, namely that Bulgaria submits to the Commission a restructuring programme and business plans, and that the Commission provides a final assessment of whether that programme and plans meet the requirements listed in Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement, and that the Council decides that the programme and plans are in compliance with that Article. 3.
On 18 March 2004, the Bulgarian government adopted a National Restructuring Plan for the steel sector (NRP) and an individual business plan (IBP) for the only company benefiting of state aid, Kremikovtzi, which cover the period 1998-2006.
This allowed the EU Council to confirm the extension of the period in which state aid may exceptionally be granted for restructuring until 31 December 2005 or the date of accession, whichever comes first (Council Decision 2004/746/EC of 18 October 2004[2]). 4.
These commitments are specified in the EU-Common Position of June 2004 (CONF-BG 18/04) which led to the closure of the Competition Chapter in the accession negotiations. 5.
The monitoring carried out on the basis of 6-monthly reports from Bulgaria and an annual independent evaluation carried out on behalf of the Commission in 2005 showed that Bulgaria lacked considerably behind the benchmarks for implementing the restructuring plan.
Following from this, the Bulgarian government prepared a revised National Restructuring Programme (NRP) which was approved by the government on 13 September 2006 and formally notified to the Commission on 19 September 2006.
However, Bulgaria does not ask an extension of the period for granting restructuring aid, i.e.
The Commission is proposing a Council Decision which establishes the Community position for the necessary amendment of Article 3 of this Additional Protocol. 10.
The Council is therefore requested to approve the attached draft proposal for a Decision on a Community position in the EC-Bulgaria Association Council on the amendment of Article 3 of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement.
The Additional Protocol has been modified by Decision No 1/2004 of the EU-Bulgaria Association Council of 28 September 2004[5]. (2) Under Article 4, the Additional Protocol may be amended by decision of the Association Council, HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: Sole Article The position to be adopted by the Community in the Association Council established by the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and Bulgaria shall be based on the draft Decision of the EC-Bulgaria Association Council annexed to this Decision.
In its restructuring programme Bulgaria proposes that if monitoring of the implementation of the restructuring shows that the relevant requirements of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement and key restructuring measures (including all investments implemented) have not been fulfilled or that in the course of the restructuring period Bulgaria has granted additional State aid in favour of the steel industry, and to Kremikovtzi AD in particular, Bulgaria will recover any aid granted in breach of these conditions according to the law applicable before or after its accession to the European Union. (2) The Commission has made an assessment of the modified restructuring programme and the business plan submitted by Bulgaria.
The assessment indicates that the implementation of the restructuring programme and the business plan will allow the company concerned to reach viability under normal market conditions and meet the requirements of Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement. (3) The European Union and Bulgaria agree to closely monitor the implementation of the restructuring programme.
The European Commission may require Bulgaria to take appropriate steps to modify the restructuring plan for Kremikovtzi AD company in case the fulfilment of the requirements of Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement are unlikely to be fulfilled.
The European Commission shall decide whether the restructuring programme and the plans are fully implemented and are in compliance with the requirements of Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement.
