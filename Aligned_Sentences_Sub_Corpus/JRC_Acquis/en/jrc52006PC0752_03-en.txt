INTRODUCTION On 26 October 2004, the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation signed an Agreement on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis (the “Schengen agreement with Switzerland”)[1].
That Agreement anticipated Liechtenstein’s possible association with the Schengen acquis and made provision in its Article 16 for Liechtenstein to accede to the Agreement by means of a protocol determining the rights and obligations of each of the contracting parties.
By letter dated 12 October 2001, Liechtenstein had already expressed its interest in joining Switzerland as a contracting party to a possible Schengen and Dublin acquis association agreement since an open border policy for the movement of persons had existed between Liechtenstein and Switzerland for decades.
The texts of the Protocol and the related documents are attached to this Decision.
