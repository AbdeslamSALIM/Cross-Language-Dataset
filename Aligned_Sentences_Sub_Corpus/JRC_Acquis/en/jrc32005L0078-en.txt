Commission Directive 2005/78/EC of 14 November 2005 implementing Directive 2005/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the measures to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from compression-ignition engines for use in vehicles, and the emission of gaseous pollutants from positive ignition engines fuelled with natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas for use in vehicles and amending Annexes I, II, III, IV and VI thereto (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Directive 2005/78/EC of 14 November 2005 implementing Directive 2005/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the measures to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from compression-ignition engines for use in vehicles, and the emission of gaseous pollutants from positive ignition engines fuelled with natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas for use in vehicles and amending Annexes I, II, III, IV and VI thereto (Text with EEA relevance) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers [1], and in particular second indent of Article 13(2) thereof, Having regard to Directive 2005/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 September 2005 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the measures to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from compression-ignition engines for use in vehicles, and the emission of gaseous pollutants from positive ignition engines fuelled with natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas for use in vehicles [2], and in particular Article 7 thereof, Whereas: (1) Directive 2005/55/EC is one of the separate directives under the type-approval procedure laid down by Directive 70/156/EEC. (2) Directive 2005/55/EC requires new heavy-duty engines and engines of new heavy-duty vehicles to comply with new technical requirements covering on-board diagnostic systems, durability and conformity of in-service vehicles which are properly maintained and used, from 1 October 2005.
The technical provisions necessary to implement Articles 3 and 4 of that Directive should be adopted. (3) In order to ensure compliance with Article 5 of Directive 2005/55/EC, it is appropriate to introduce requirements encouraging the proper use, as intended by the manufacturer, of new heavy-duty vehicles equipped with engines having an exhaust after-treatment system requiring the use of a consumable reagent to achieve the intended reduction of regulated pollutants.
Member States should be able to take appropriate steps to encourage the use of such reagents. (5) It is appropriate to introduce requirements that will enable the Member States to monitor and ensure, at the time of the periodic technical inspection, that heavy-duty vehicles equipped with exhaust after-treatment systems requiring the use of a consumable reagent have been properly operated during the period preceding the inspection. (6) Member States should be able to prohibit the use of any heavy-duty vehicle equipped with an exhaust after-treatment system that requires the use of a consumable reagent in order to achieve the emission limits for which such vehicles were granted a type-approval if the exhaust after-treatment system does not actually consume the required reagent or if the vehicle does not carry the required reagent. (7) Manufacturers of heavy-duty vehicles equipped with exhaust after-treatment systems requiring the use of a consumable reagent should inform their customers how such vehicles should properly be operated. (8) The requirements of Directive 2005/55/EC relating to the use of defeat strategies should be adapted to take account of technical progress.
The reference fuels used for the type-approval testing of engines against the emission limits specified in row B1, row B2 and row C of the tables in Annex I to Directive 2005/55/EC should therefore be redefined in order to better reflect, where applicable, the sulphur content of the diesel fuels that are available on the market from 1 January 2005 and that are used by engines with advanced emission control systems.
They shall apply those provisions from 9 November 2006.
Article 4 This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 5 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

If the type-approval authority is not satisfied with the manufacturers' ISM according to section 3.4 or on a reported evidence of unsatisfactory in-service conformity, e.g., according to section 3.5, may order the manufacturer to run test for confirmatory purposes.
The confirmatory test should be applicable engine ESC, ETC and ELR tests, as specified in Section 4.
A test result may be regarded as non-satisfactory when, from tests of two or more engines representing the same engine family, for any regulated pollutant component, the limit value as shown in section 6.2.1 of Annex I to Directive 2005/55/EC is exceeded significantly. 6.
Where the type-approval authority is not satisfied with the information or test data supplied by the manufacturer, and, having carried out confirmatory engine testing according to section 5, or based on confirmatory testing conducted by a Member State (section 6.3), and it is certain that an engine type is not in conformity with the requirements of these provisions, the type-approval authority must request the manufacturer to submit a plan of remedial measure to remedy the non-conformity. 6.2.
In this case, the remedial measures referred to in Article 11(2) and in Annex X to Directive 70/156/EEC [or the refont of the framework Directive] are extended to engines in service belonging to the same vehicle type which are likely to be affected with the same defects, in accordance with section 8.
To be valid the plan of remedial measures presented by the manufacturer must be approved by the type-approval authority.
The type-approval authority must notify its decision to all Member States within 30 days.
The Member States may require that the same plan of remedial measures be applied to all engines of the same type registered in their territory. 6.3.
If a Member State has established that an engine type does not conform to the applicable requirements of this Annex, it must notify without delay the Member State which granted the original type-approval in accordance with the requirements of Article 11(3) of Directive 70/156/EEC.
The competent authority which granted the original type-approval shall, within two months, consult the manufacturer in order to secure agreement on a plan of measures and on carrying out the plan.
PLAN OF REMEDIAL MEASURES 7.1.
The type-approval authority must within 30 working days declare its approval or disapproval of the plan of remedial measures.
The remedial measures must apply to all engines likely to be affected by the same defect.
The plan of remedial measures must include the requirements specified in 7.4.1 to 7.4.11.
A description of each engine type included in the plan of remedial measures. 7.4.2.
A description of the method by which the manufacturer informs the engine or vehicle owners about the remedial measures. 7.4.4.
Any other information, reports or data the type-approval authority may reasonably determine is necessary to evaluate the plan of remedial measures. 7.4.11.
The type-approval authority must have access to the record on request for a period of 5 years from the implementation of the plan of remedial measures. 7.7.
INTRODUCTION This Annex describes the provisions specific to the on-board diagnostic (OBD) system for the emission control systems of motor vehicles. 2.
REQUIREMENTS AND TESTS 3.1.
General requirements 3.1.1.
In achieving this objective the approval authority must accept that engines which have been used in excess of the appropriate durability period defined in Article 3 of this Directive may show some deterioration in OBD system performance such that the OBD thresholds given in the table in Article 4(3) of this Directive may be exceeded before the OBD system signals a failure to the driver of the vehicle. 3.1.2.
All emission related fault codes must be consistent with those described in section 6.8.5 of this Annex. 3.2.
In satisfying the Stage 1 requirements, the OBD system must monitor for: 3.2.2.1.
reduction in the efficiency of the deNOx system, where fitted, with respect to the emissions of NOx only. 3.2.2.3.
reduction in the efficiency of the particulate filter, where fitted, with respect to the emissions of particulate only. 3.2.2.4.
reduction in the efficiency of a combined deNOx-particulate filter system, where fitted, with respect to both the emissions of NOx and particulate. 3.2.3.
Major functional failure 3.2.3.1.
As an alternative to monitoring against the appropriate OBD threshold limits with respect to sections 3.2.2.1 to 3.2.2.4, OBD systems of diesel engines may in accordance with Article 4(1) of this Directive monitor for major functional failure of the following components: - a catalyst, where fitted as a separate unit, that may or may not be part of a deNOx system or particulate filter - a deNOx system, where fitted - a particulate filter, where fitted - a combined deNOx-particulate filter system. 3.2.3.2.
This provision shall not apply to an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) device, a deNOx system, a particulate filter or a combined deNOx-particulate filter system nor shall it apply to a component or system that is monitored for major functional failure. 3.3.
The OBD system must consider the communication interface (hardware and messages) between the engine system electronic control unit(s) (EECU) and any other power train or vehicle control unit when the exchanged information has an influence on the correct functioning of the emission control.
the transmission control unit (TECU)) for electrical disconnection. 3.3.3 Manufacturers may demonstrate to the approval authority that certain components or systems need not be monitored if, in the event of their total failure or removal, emissions do not exceed the applicable thresholds limits for OBD Stage 2 given in the table in Article 4(3) of this Directive when measured over the cycles shown in section 1.1 of Appendix 1 to this Annex.
This provision shall not apply to an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) device, a deNOx system, a particulate filter or a combined deNOx-particulate filter system. 3.4.
any other emission-related engine or exhaust aftertreatment component or system connected to an electronic control unit must be monitored for electrical disconnection unless otherwise monitored. 3.4.1.4.
In the case of engines equipped with an aftertreatment system using a consumable reagent, the OBD system must monitor for: - lack of any required reagent - the quality of the required reagent being within the specifications declared by the manufacturer in Annex II to Directive 2005/55/EC - reagent consumption and dosing activity according to section 6.5.4 of Annex I to Directive 2005/55/EC. 3.5.
Outside these normal operating conditions the emission control system may show some degradation in OBD system performance such that the thresholds given in the table in Article 4(3) of this Directive may be exceeded before the OBD system signals a failure to the driver of the vehicle.
The affected OBD monitoring systems may be disabled if its ability to monitor is affected by low fuel levels.
For this reason, disablement is permitted when the fuel tank level falls below 20 % of the nominal capacity of the fuel tank. 3.5.1.2.
The affected OBD monitoring systems may be temporarily disabled during the operation of an auxiliary emission control strategy as described in section 6.1.5.1 of Annex I to Directive 2005/55/EC. 3.5.1.3.
The affected OBD monitoring systems may be temporarily disabled when operational safety or limp-home strategies are activated. 3.5.1.4.
The affected OBD monitoring systems may be disabled temporarily outside the conditions of use defined in section 6.1.5.4 of Annex I to Directive 2005/55/EC when this disablement can be justified by a limitation of the OBD monitoring (including modelling) capability. 3.5.2.
Activation of malfunction indicator (MI) 3.6.1.
The OBD system must incorporate a malfunction indicator readily visible to the vehicle operator.
The MI must be visible in all reasonable lighting conditions.
The MI must also activate if the OBD system is unable to fulfil the basic monitoring requirements specified in this Directive. 3.6.5.
A fault code must also be stored in the cases referred to in sections 3.4.1.1 and 3.4.1.3 of this Annex. 3.7.1.
If monitoring has been disabled for 10 driving cycles due to the continued operation of the vehicle under conditions conforming to those specified in section 3.5.1.2 of this Annex, readiness for the subject monitoring system may be set to "ready" status without monitoring having been completed. 3.7.2.
Extinguishing the MI 3.8.1.
In the case of MI activation due to incorrect reagent consumption and dosing activity, the MI may be switched back to the previous state of activation if the conditions given in section 6.5.4 of Annex I to Directive 2005/55/EC no longer apply. 3.9.
In the case of OBD stage 1 referred to in section 3.2, the OBD system must: 4.1.1.1.
indicate the failure of an emission-related component or system when that failure results in an increase in emissions above the OBD thresholds given in the table in Article 4(3) of this Directive, or; 4.1.1.2.
where appropriate, indicate any major functional failure of an exhaust aftertreatment system. 4.1.2.
In the case of OBD stage 2 referred to in section 3.3, the OBD system must indicate the failure of an emission-related component or system when that failure results in an increase in emissions above the OBD thresholds given in the table in Article 4(3) of this Directive. 4.1.3.

Prior to or at the time of type-approval, no deficiency shall be granted in respect of the requirements of section 3.2.3 and section 6, except sub-section 6.8.5 of this Annex. 4.3.7.
A deficiency may be carried-over for a period of two years after the date of type-approval of the engine type or vehicle in respect of its engine type, unless it can be adequately demonstrated that substantial engine modifications and additional lead-time beyond two years would be necessary to correct the deficiency.
In such a case, the deficiency may be carried-out for a period not exceeding three years. 4.3.7.2.
In such a case, the deficiency may be carried-out for a period not exceeding three years. 4.3.7.3.
