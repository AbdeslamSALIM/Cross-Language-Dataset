INTRODUCTION Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003[1] on GM food and feed (“the Regulation”) has applied since 18 April 2004.
Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003[4] on the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability and labelling of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC was developed alongside Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and was also adopted on 22 September 2003.
This report was adopted on 10 May 2006[5].
Part 1: Implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 2.
Presentation of the authorisation procedure The authorisation procedure is composed of three major steps.
The procedure is stopped whenever EFSA (or the CRL via EFSA) seeks supplementary information from the applicant.
It is therefore important to make a clear distinction between the scientific opinions of the GMO Panel and the overall EFSA opinions that are required by the Regulation.
On 18 April 2004, the CRL published “explanatory notes to applicants” in order to provide the applicants with practical instructions concerning the method validation task of the CRL as described in Regulation (EC) 1829/2003 and in the Regulation (EC) 641/2004[10] (see point 7 of the current report).
On 1 July 2006, the CRL had carried out the validation of 16 methods.
Comments of the public Articles 6(7) and 18(7) of the Regulation provide that the public may - within 30 days from its publication – make comments on the overall EFSA opinion.
Up until May 2006, EFSA has received 26 individual requests from the public to access a total of 73 separate documents or applications submitted to EFSA under Regulation (EC) 1829/2003.
Practical experience of the authorisation procedure So far, one authorisation[16] (for the placing on the market of food containing consisting or produced from 1507 maize) has been given following this procedure.
This consultation process allows for EFSA to take into consideration all the scientific comments from the Member States prior to finalising the scientific opinion of the GMO Panel.
EFSA experiences difficulties to find CA willing to carry out the initial risk assessment for such applications. 2.1.6.
Practical improvements of the authorisation procedure In light of recent practical experience acquired with the placing on the market of GMOs and of Member State’s demands for more streamlined decision making procedures, the Commission has concluded in April 2006 that practical improvements could be made to the system regarding the scientific consistency and transparency for Decisions on GMOs taken under Directive 2001/18/EC and the Regulation and to develop consensus between all interested parties.
In order to ensure a smooth transition to the new authorisation regime, Article 46 of the Regulation provides for transitional measures allowing applications that were in an advanced stage of the authorisation procedure to continue to be considered and authorised under the relevant legislation.
In order to cover these GM products, articles 8 and 20 of the Regulation stipulate that operators who wished to continue marketing an “existing product” had to notify the Commission and submit detailed information on the GM products before 18 October, 2004.
GM seeds are therefore covered by the scope of articles 8 and 20.
This has been reflected in the Community Register via a specific footnote added on 11 July 2005.
However, Articles 12 provides that these labelling requirements shall not apply to food containing material, which contains, consists of or is produced from GMOs in a proportion no higher than 0.9 % of the food ingredients considered individually or food consisting of a single ingredient, provided that this presence is adventitious or technically unavoidable.
In particular, the Commission, with the support of Member States, adopted on 18 April 2005 Decision 2005/317/EC[20].
In particular, the Commission adopted on 23 August Decision 2006/578/EC on emergency measures regarding the non-authorised genetically modified organism LL RICE 601 in rice products[22] to prevent the placing on the market of these contaminated products.
The Authority adopted a statement on 14 September.
The findings of products contaminated with LLRice601 were notified to the other Member States via the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) allowing, in particular, the withdrawal from the market of products that had been dispatched to several Member States.
It is nevertheless to be noted that it is unlikely that, in this type of situations where the GMOs in question are not intended to be commercialised, the available data will be sufficient to complete a full safety assessment in accordance with EU standards.
Based on data provided for 2004/2005, 3 MSs performed no sampling controls on seed consignments for the adventitious presence of GMO. ( Commission Recommendation 2004/787/EC on technical guidance for sampling and detection of GMOs and material produced from GMOs as or in products in the context of Regulation (EC) No. 1830/2003 was not being routinely complied with in the Member States visited.
In a number of cases Member States used alternative sampling strategies such as international standards ISO 2859, or Community legislation (Directive 76/371/EEC for feed control, or Directive 98/53/EC on mycotoxin sampling).
Competent authorities indicated a difficulty in applying the sampling provisions of the recommendation in particular to large consignments of food and feed. ( Official control laboratories dealing with GMOs analysis were usually accredited to ISO standards (either ISO 17025 or ISO 45000) although there were still some laboratories lacking the necessary accreditation.
This means that they were unable to determine if food or feed samples which were positive for the presence of GMO were above the threshold level of 0.9% and thus they were unable to enforce the labelling requirements set down in Art 12 of the Regulation. ( Six MSs did not take action in all cases with regard to positive results (trace amounts) for seed consignments.
Part 2: Development of implementing measures and specific clarifications 6.
In addition to Regulation (EC) No 641/2004 (see point 7 of the current report), the Committee provided a positive opinion on the draft Commission Decision on emergency measures regarding the non-authorised GMO Bt10 in maize products that was adopted as Decision 2005/317/EC[25] (see point 4.2 of the current report for further details).
ADOPTION OF IMPLEMENTING RULES AND GUIDELINES On 6 April 2004 the Commission adopted Regulation (EC) No 641/2004[26] on detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the application for the authorisation of new GM food and feed, the notification of existing products and adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of GM material which has benefited from a favourable risk evaluation.
The detailed requirements concerning applications submitted in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of the Regulation are provided for in Chapter I of Regulation (EC) No 641/2004.
Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 641/2004 contains the implementing rules related to Article 47 of the Regulation providing for transitional measures for adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of GM material which has benefited from a favourable risk evaluation.
These measures remain applicable until 18 April 2007.
In accordance with this Chapter, the Commission published a list that distinguishes between material fulfilling all the requirements of Article 47 and material for which a method of detection is not publicly available.
The Commission will continue to update this list until 18 April 2007.
In addition, Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004[27] establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms and Commission Recommendation 2004/787/EC[28] on technical guidance for sampling and detection of genetically modified organisms and material produced from genetically modified organisms as or in products in the context of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 were adopted on 14 January 2004 and 4 October 2004, respectively.
A second guidance document for the risk assessment of genetically modified microorganisms and their derived products intended for food and feed use has been adopted by the GMO Panel on 17 May 2006[31]. 8.
Existing products are products that were lawfully placed on the market prior to 18 April 2004, either on the basis of a Decision taken under Directive 90/220/EEC, Directive 2001/18/EC, Regulation (EC) No 258/97, Directive 70/524/EEC or Directive 82/471/EEC or on the basis that the products did not require any specific authorisation.
According to Articles 8(4) and 20(4) of the Regulation, the placing on the market of existing products is subject to the procedure for the renewal of authorisations, which applies mutatis mutandis . ( Applicants who wish to apply for a renewal of authorisations for existing products falling under Articles 8(1)(a) and 20(1)(a) of the Regulation (in particular, products that were already covered by an authorisation for placing on the market before the application of the Regulation, including GMOs that were authorised under Directive 90/220/EC or Directive 2001/18/EC) should not submit their applications before 18 April 2007, which is the earliest possible date, three years after the date of application of the Regulation. - For the products for which the period of 9 years of placing on the market elapses before this date, the applications have to be submitted on 18 April 2007. - For the other products, the time limit can be later on condition that it is within 9 years from their first placing on the market. ( Applicants who wish to apply for a renewal of authorisations for existing products falling under Articles 8(1)(b) and 20(1)(b) (products for which an authorisation was not required before the application of the Regulation) should submit their applications before 18 April 2007.
This threshold is only valid for the adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of products that have benefited from the favourable opinion of a Community Scientific Committee or of EFSA before 18 April 2004, and provided that the application for its authorisation has not been rejected in accordance with the relevant Community legislation and that a detection method is publicly available.
Article 47 will remain applicable until three years after the entry into force of the Regulation, i.e. 18 April 2007.
Clarification of the status of food or feed produced by fermentation using genetically modified micro-organisms not present in the final product The status of food or feed produced by fermentation using genetically modified micro-organisms has to be clarified in the light of the recital n° 16 of the Regulation.
In these cases, the produced foods and food ingredients fall under the scope of the Regulation and have to be authorised and labelled accordingly.
Application of the clarification to feed products and processing aids Article 2(2)(h) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition defines feed processing aids as “any substance not consumed as a feedingstuff by itself, intentionally used in the processing of feedingstuffs or feed materials to fulfil a technological purpose during treatment or processing which may result in the unintentional but technologically unavoidable presence of residues of the substance or its derivatives in the final product, provided that these residues do not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and do not have any technological effects on the finished feed”.
When the GM micro-organisms are present as such in the feed, whether as or in a product that fall within the definition of feed additives provided by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, that product must also be approved under that Regulation before it may be placed on the market and used.
Guidelines on the Safety assessment of food or feed produced by fermentation using genetically modified micro-organisms The GMO Panel of EFSA has adopted on 17 May 2006 its guidance document for the risk assessment of genetically modified micro-organism and their derived products intended for food and feed use[38].
The guidance was subject to public consultation between 15 July and 30 September 2005.
However, the Council and the Parliament have acted by laying down specific labelling rules for GM food in the Regulation.
Two categories of products can be distinguished: (1) Food categories that have not been genetically modified hitherto: labelling these foods as GM free is suggesting that they possess a special characteristic when in fact all similar food possess the same characteristic, and this is misleading within the meaning of Article 2(1)(a)(iii) of Directive 2000/13/EC. (2) Food products that can be genetically modified or not: Such food can be placed on the market without a GM label provided that they contain less than 0,9 % of GM material and that the presence of GM material is unintentional and technically unavoidable.
Some Member States have developed national rules regarding this type of labelling and the Commission notes that in most of those Member States such national rules stipulate that the threshold for adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of GM material in GM free products should be below the level of detection of the current analytical methods. 12.
While this has been the case for the first authorisation, the Commission agreed in April 2006 on practical improvements with the objective of building greater consensus and transparency regarding the authorisation for the placing on the market of GM products either under the Regulation or under Directive 2001/18/EC and EFSA engaged to reinforce collaboration with Member States on GMO risk assessment.
The accidental release has occurred because some batches of Bt 10 were erroneously labelled as Bt11 [20] OJ L 101, 21.4.2005, p. 14. [21] LLRICE601 is a GM rice that has been developed for tolerance to the Liberty® herbicide.
