Case T-190/06: Action brought on 19 July 2006 — Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission Action brought on 19 July 2006 — Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission Parties Applicants: Total SA and Elf Aquitaine (Courbevoie, France) (represented by: E.
Morgan de Rivery, lawyer, and A.
Noël-Baron, lawyer) Defendant: Commission of the European Communities Form of order sought - annul Articles 1(o) and (p), 2(i), 3 and 4 of Commission Decision C(2006) 1766 final of 3 May 2006; - in the alternative, amend Article 2(i) of Commission Decision C(2006) 1766 final of 3 May 2006, in so far as it imposes a fine of EUR 78.663 million on Arkema SA, of which Total SA is held jointly and severally liable for EUR 42 million, and ELF Aquitaine SA for EUR 65.1 million, and reduce the amount of the fine in question to an appropriate level; - in any event, order the Commission to pay all the costs.
The applicants also consider that the contested decision breaches the unitary nature of the concept of an undertaking within the meaning of Article 81 EC and Article 23(2) of Regulation 1/2003 [1], and also the rules which govern whether breaches committed by a subsidiary can be imputed to its parent company.
The applicants finally consider that the Commission infringes the rules governing the calculation of fines such as the principle of equal treatment, in so far as it does not apply a reduction of 25 % to the starting amount of the fine imposed on the applicants whereas it did apply it to another undertaking to which the contested decision was addressed.
They seek to obtain a reduction of 25 % in the starting amount of the fine imposed upon them and also to rely on mitigating circumstances in that they were ordered to pay large fines almost simultaneously in two similar cases. [1] Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty, OJ 2003 L 1, p. 1 --------------------------------------------------
