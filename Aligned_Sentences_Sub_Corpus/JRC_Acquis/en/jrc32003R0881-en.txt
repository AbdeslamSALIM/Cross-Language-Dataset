In the interests of clarity, those texts should be republished in their entirety. (5) The Andean Community and the Central American Common Market, which, pursuant to Article 72 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, have benefited separately from regional cumulation of origin within the framework of the generalised system of preferences, have requested that, in order to foster industrial development in those regions, they be allowed to benefit jointly from the regional cumulation provisions.
It should therefore be made possible for that group to benefit from the regional cumulation provisions. (6) Proofs of origin issued under the arrangements previously applicable for the Andean Community and the Central American Common Market should continue to be accepted within the limits of their validity. (7) In order to avoid confusion, given that entitlement to regional cumulation does not always coincide with membership of regional groups, the names of regional groups should no longer be used to indicate the countries which may benefit from regional cumulation. (8) The opportunity should be taken to make a correction in Article 76 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. (9) The time-limits for the production of a document showing that goods covered by an incomplete declaration qualify for a reduced or zero rate of import duty should be made more flexible. (10) The management system for tariff quotas provides, as a measure to reduce the administrative burden and costs at importation and to promote uniformity of treatment, that certain tariff quotas are to be considered as critical.
The duration of the suspension should be limited to one year but it should be possible to extend it in particular where debtors who are not benefiting from the suspension have contested the customs debt before the competent judicial authorities. (22) Article 890 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 provides that duties are to be repaid or remitted on imports eligible for Community treatment or preferential tariff treatment where a customs debt has been incurred as a result of release for free circulation of the goods and where the importer can produce a post-clearance document showing entitlement to such treatments at the time of the release for free circulation.
A tariff quota shall be considered as critical as soon as 75 % of the initial volume has been used, or at the discretion of the competent authorities. 2.
Where goods are transported from one point in the customs territory of the Community to another under the procedure for the international transport of goods under cover of TIR carnets (TIR Convention) or under cover of ATA carnets (ATA Convention), the customs territory of the Community shall, for the purposes of the rules governing the use of the TIR or ATA carnets for such transport, be considered to form a single territory.%quot% (14) In Article 453(2), %quot%Articles 314 to 324%quot% is replaced by %quot%Articles 314b to 324f%quot%.

Article 455a 1.
To initiate the enquiry procedure, the customs authorities of the Member State of entry or departure shall send the customs authorities of the Member State of destination or exit a request together with all the necessary information. 4.
Where an enquiry establishes that the TIR operation was terminated correctly, the customs authorities of the Member State of entry or departure shall immediately inform the guaranteeing association and the holder of the TIR carnet and, where appropriate, any customs authorities that may have initiated a recovery procedure in accordance with Articles 217 to 232 of the Code.%quot% (17) In Part II, Title II, Chapter 9, %quot%Section 2%quot% and the title of the section are deleted. (18) Articles 456 and 457 are replaced by the following: %quot%Article 456 1.
When an offence or irregularity under the TIR Convention gives rise to a customs debt in the Community, the provisions of this section shall apply mutatis mutandis to the other charges mentioned in Article 91(1)(a) of the Code. 2.
For the purposes of Article 8(4) of the TIR Convention, when a TIR operation is carried out on the customs territory of the Community, any guaranteeing association established in the Community may become liable for the payment of the secured amount of the customs debt relating to the goods concerned in the TIR operation up to a limit per TIR carnet of EUR 60000 or the national currency equivalent thereof. 2.
The guaranteeing association established in the Member State competent for recovery under Article 215 of the Code shall be liable for payment of the secured amount of the customs debt. 3.
Where it is found that, in the course of or in connection with a transit operation carried out under cover of an ATA carnet, an offence or irregularity has been committed in a particular Member State, the recovery of duties and other charges which may be payable shall be effected by that Member State in accordance with Community or national provisions, without prejudice to the institution of criminal proceedings. 3.
Article 457d 1.
Where an offence or irregularity is found to have been committed in the course of or in connection with a transit operation carried out under cover of an ATA carnet, the customs authorities shall notify the holder of the ATA carnet and the guaranteeing association within the period prescribed in Article 6(4) of the ATA Convention. 2.
In this case, the customs authorities shall take all requisite measures to ensure that the goods placed in a customs warehouse, in a free zone or in a free warehouse may later be recognised as non-Community goods.%quot% (b) Paragraph 3 is deleted.

ANNEX I %quot%ANNEX 14 INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO THE LIST IN ANNEX 15 Note 1: The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Articles 69 and 100.
Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an %quot%ex%quot%, this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2. 2.2.
Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4. 2.4.
The provisions of Articles 69 and 100, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the beneficiary country or republic or in the Community.
Example: An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex works price, is made from %quot%other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging%quot% of heading ex 7224.
The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the beneficiary country or republic.
Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together.
The term %quot%natural fibres%quot% includes horsehair of heading 0503, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305. 4.3.
The term %quot%man-made staple fibres%quot% is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.
Example: A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn.
Example: A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric.
Example: If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product. 5.3.
In the case of products incorporating %quot%yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped%quot%, this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn. 5.4.
In the case of products incorporating %quot%strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film%quot%, this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.
Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product. 6.2.
Example: If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63.
Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.
For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the %quot%specific processes%quot% are the following: (a) vacuum-distillation; (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process(1); (c) cracking; (d) reforming; (e) extraction by means of selective solvents; (f) the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite; (g) polymerisation; (h) alkylation; (i) isomerisation. 7.2.
For the purposes of headings ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water-separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur-contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.
