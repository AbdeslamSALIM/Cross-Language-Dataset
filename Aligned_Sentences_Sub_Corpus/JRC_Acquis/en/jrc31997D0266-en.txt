SLIDES AND OTHER PHOTOGRAPHIC MATERIAL (to be supplied where relevant) . 38 Introduction Central to the success of Natura 2000 is the level of information, on habitats and species of Community interest which will be assembled during the coming years.
Experience in data collection in Europe has been build up through the Corine biotopes projects, which at present describes over 6 000 sites in the European Union.
All data fields from the existing data sheet for the 'birds` Directive are fully compatible with the new entry form.
The legal basis for providing the data to implement this phase of Natura 2000 is outlined in Article 4 of the Habitats Directive which defines that 'information shall include a map of the site, its name, location, extent and the data resulting from application of the criteria specified in Annex III (Stage 1) provided in a format established by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21.
As regards the ecological information requirements this is further clarified in Section 3 of the explanatory notes.
In consultation with the relevant authorities, it is hoped to develop the Natura 2000 database system in a format that will be compatible with the information gathered under international agreements and convention, such as biogenetic reserves and the European diploma of the Council of Europe.
A database is at present being established under the auspices of the Ornis Committee to compile data on bird populations in each region of the Community. %gt%REFERENCE TO A FILM%gt% Natura 2000 data-entry form and database One form type is to be used for all sites included in this stage of the development of Natura 2000 to cover classified Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and those sites that are eligible as sites of Community importance (SCI).
SITE IDENTIFICATION 1.1.
Each of these codes (from A to K) corresponds to a particular relation as outlined in Figure 1.
Example: 199305: data first compiled in May 1993. 1.4.
Relations with other described sites (obligatory if relation exists) This field provides a cross-reference to all related described sites for which the Natura 2000 form is being used: proposed eligible sites of Community importance (SCI) and classified special protection areas (SPA) (and in the future will be used for sites designated as special areas of conservation).
Give the site code of each related site. 1.6.
SITE LOCATION 2.1.
This coding system must be applied to all regional coding applications in the Commission.
ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION For the establishment of the list of sites of Community importance (SCI) under Directive 92/43/EEC Member States must provide the relevant information on the habitat types of Annex I (section 3.1) and for the species of flora and fauna of Annex II (sections 3.2.c to 3.2.g).
Habitat types present on the site and site assessment for them (i) Codes and % cover of habitats - Annex I habitat types: codes and their % cover within the site (Appendix B) Enter here the code of the habitat types of Annex I of Directive 92/43/EEC, as indicated in Appendix B.
All Annex I habitats occurring in the specific site must be entered, with the % cover (linked to criteria A(b) of Annex III of the Directive).
The 'best expert judgment` may be used to assess this global value, and the ranking system used to express it should be as follows: A: excellent value, B: good value, C: significant value. 3.2.
Species referred to in Article 4 of Directive 79/409/EEC and species listed in Annex II to Directive 92/43/EEC and site evaluation for them (i) Code, name and population data on species For sites as appropriate enter the scientific name of all bird species relevant for Article 4 (1) and 4 (2) of Council Directive 79/409/EEC, and of all fauna and flora species listed on Annex II of Council Directive 92/43/EEC that occur at the site with an indication of their population within the site (see below).
Where an exact number is not known give population range in which it falls (1-5, 6-10, 11-50, 51-100, 101-250, 251-500, 501-1 000, 1 001-10 000, %gt% 10 000).
In this case note the population size/density by indicating whether the species is common (C), rare (R) or very rare (V).
Otherwise indicate whether the species is common (C), rare (R), or very rare (V).
As proposed for criterion A(b) an estimate or a class interval should be used according to the following progressive model: A: 100 % %amp%ge; p %gt% 15 %, B: 15 % %amp%ge; p %gt% 2 %, C: 2 % %amp%ge; p %gt% 0 %.
International Conventions (including Berne, Bonn and Biodiversity), - D.
The total cover of habitat classes should be 100 % and correspond to the total surface area of the site.
Site designation (to be supplied where relevant) Enter as free text any aspect of the site designation that is not adequately covered by the codes used in site designation codes fields (see Section 5). 4.5.
SITE PROTECTION AND RELATION WITH CORINE BIOTOPE SITES With regard to the recorded relationships indicated in 5.1 and 5.2 below, a map clearly showing the boundaries of these related sites must be delivered (see Section 7 of explanatory notes for further clarification on this) 5.1.
Designation types used with the intention to protect fauna, flora, habitats and landscapes (the latter as far as relevant for fauna, flora and for habitat protection); B.
Relationship with Corine biotope sites (to be supplied where relevant) For all described sites which overlap with Corine biotope sites, record the Corine site code, the type of overlap (using notation as in 5.2.) and the percentage of the described site that is overlapping with the Corine site. 6.
