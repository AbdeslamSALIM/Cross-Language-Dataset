EXISTING MEASURES (1) Following the initiation [2] of an anti-dumping investigation on 23 October 2004, the Commission imposed on 23 April 2005 by Regulation (EC) No 628/2005 [3] provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of farmed salmon originating in Norway (Regulation imposing a provisional duty). (2) The provisional anti-dumping duties which took the form of ad valorem duties ranging between 6,8 % and 24,5 % of the value of the imported products apply as of 27 April 2005. 2.
Exporting producers representing a significant percentage of the trade involved have requested an extension of the provisional measures for a further period not exceeding three months. (14) Therefore, and in accordance with Article 7(7) of the basic Regulation, it is decided to extend the duration of the provisional measures until 22 January 2006, inclusive. 4.
A provisional anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of farmed (other than wild) salmon, whether or not filleted, fresh, chilled or frozen, falling within CN codes ex03021200, ex03031100, ex03031900, ex03032200, ex03041013 and ex03042013 (hereinafter farmed salmon) originating in Norway. 2.
The amount of the provisional anti-dumping duty shall be the difference between the minimum import price fixed in paragraph 4 and the free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, if the latter is lower than the former.
No duty shall be collected where the net, free-at-Community-frontier price is equal to or higher than corresponding minimum import price fixed in paragraph 4. 4.
For the purpose of paragraph 3, the following minimum import price shall apply per kilogram net product weight: Presentation of farmed salmon | Minimum import price EUR/kg net product weight | TARIC code | Whole fish, fresh, chilled or frozen | 2,81 | 0302120012 030212003303021200930303110093030319009303032200120303220083 | Gutted, head-on, fresh, chilled or frozen | 3,12 | 0302120013030212003403021200940303110094030319009403032200130303220084 | Other (including gutted, head-off), fresh, chilled or frozen | 3,51 | 030212001503021200360302120096030311001803031100960303190018030319009603032200150303220086 | Whole fish fillets and fillets cut in pieces, weighing more than 300 g per fillet, fresh, chilled or frozen | 4,99 | 0304101312030410139303042013120304201393 | Other whole fish fillets and fillets cut in pieces, weighing 300 g or less per fillet, fresh, chilled or frozen | 6,00 | 0304101315030410139603042013150304201396 | 5.
The release for free circulation in the Community of the product referred to in paragraph 1 shall be subject to the provision of a security, equivalent to the amount of the provisional duty. 6.
In cases, where goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation and, therefore, the price actually paid or payable is apportioned for the determination of the customs value pursuant to Article 145 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 [5], the amount of anti-dumping duty, calculated on the basis of paragraph 4, shall be reduced by a percentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or payable. 7.
