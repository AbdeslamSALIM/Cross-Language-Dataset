CHOOSE TRAYS , THEREFORE , WHICH ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO ALLOW AT LEAST 8 HOLES 10 TO 13 MM IN DIAMETER TO BE MADE IN THE AGAR MEDIUM .
CALCULATE THE QUANTITY OF INOCULATED CULTURE MEDIUM ( 7.1 ) NEEDED TO PROVIDE A UNIFORM COVERING APPROXIMATELY 2 MM THICK .
THE TEST SHOULD PREFERABLY BE CARRIED OUT ON FLAT TRAYS CONSISTING OF GLASS PLATES FITTED WITH A PERFECTLY LEVEL ALUMINIUM OR PLASTIC RING , 200 MM IN DIAMETER AND 20 MM HIGH .
PIPETTE INTO THE HOLES ACCURATELY MEASURED QUANTITIES OF BETWEEN 0.10 AND 0.15 ML OF ANTIBIOTIC SOLUTION , DEPENDING ON THE DIAMETER OF THE HOLES .
RECORD THE MEASUREMENTS ON SEMI-LOGARITHMIC PAPER , PLOTTING THE LOGARITHM OF THE CONCENTRATIONS AGAINST THE DIAMETER OF THE INHIBITION ZONES .
TRACE THE LINES OF THE STANDARD SOLUTION AND OF THE EXTRACT .
THE LOGARITHM OF THE RELATIVE ACTIVITY IS CALCULATED BY USING THE FOLLOWING FORMULA : ( SEE OJ ) 9 .
