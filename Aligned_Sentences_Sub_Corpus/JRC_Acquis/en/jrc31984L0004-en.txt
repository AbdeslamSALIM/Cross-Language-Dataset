Determination of virginiamycin - by diffusion in an agar medium - 1.
The lower limit of determination is 2 mg/kg (2 ppm) (1). 2.
Principle The sample is extracted with a methanolic solution of Tween 80.

Preparation of the bacterial suspension (a) Harvest the growth from a recently prepared agar slope (3.1) with 2 to 3 ml of sodium cloride solution (4.3).
Use this suspension to inoculate 250 ml of culture medium (4.1) contained in a Roux flask and incubate for 18 to 20 hours at 30 °C.
The light transmission of the suspension must be about 75 %, measured at 650 nm in a 1 cm cell against sodium chloride solution (4.3).

Sodium chloride solution 0,8 % (w/v): dissolve 8 g sodium chloride in water and dilute to 1 000 ml; sterilize. 4.4.
Tween 80 methanolic solution 0,5 % (w/v): dissolve 5 g Tween 80 in methanol (4.4) and dilute with methanol to 1 000 ml. 4.7.
Stored in a stoppered flask at 4 °C this solution is stable for up to five days.
From this stock solution prepare by successive dilution with the mixture (4.5) the following solutions: s8 1 mg/ml s4 0,5 mg/ml s2 0,25 mg/ml s1 0,125 mg/ml 6.
Inoculation of the assay medium Inoculate the assay medium (4.1) with the bacterial suspension (3.2) at about 50 °C.
The test may be carried out on plates consisting of a sheet of glass with a faced aluminium or plastic ring placed on top, 200 mm in diameter and 20 mm high.
Apply each concentration at least four times so that each determination is subject to an evaluation of 32 zones of inhibition. 7.3.
For practical purposes the lines can be considered parallel if the values (SH-SL) and (UH-UL) do not differ by more than 10 % from their mean value.
