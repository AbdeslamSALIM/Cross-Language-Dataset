Discharge from urban waste water treatment plants to receiving waters (1) 1.
Discharges from urban waste water treatment plants subject to treatment in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 shall meet the requirements shown in Table 1. 3.
Alternative methods to those mentioned in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 may be used provided that it can be demonstrated that equivalent results are obtained.
Parameters Concentration Minimum percentage of reduction (1) Reference method of measurement Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5 at 20 °C) without nitrification (2) 25 mg/l O2 70-90 40 under Article 4 (2) Homogenized, unfiltered, undecanted sample.
Determination of dissolved oxygen before and after five-day incubation at 20 °C ± 1 °C, in complete darkness.
Analyses concerning discharges from lagooning shall be carried out on filtered samples; however, the concentration of total suspended solids in unfiltered water samples shall not exceed 150 mg/l.
This alternative applies if it can be shown that paragraph 1 of Annex I.D is fulfilled.
