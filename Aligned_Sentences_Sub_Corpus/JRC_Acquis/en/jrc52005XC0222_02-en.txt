SUMMARY OF THE LETTER TO THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT Description On 19 March 2003 a complaint was sent to the Commission listing a series of alleged aid measures in favour of Schneider Technologies AG (called Schneider Rundfunkwerke AG until 2000, hereinafter "Schneider AG").
The relevant undertaking, Schneider AG Schneider AG is a German consumer electronics producer.
From 2000 to 2002, the two main business areas were regrouped in two fully owned Schneider AG subsidiaries: Schneider Electronics AG and Schneider Laser Technologies AG.
In the course of these proceedings, assets and various trademarks of Schneider AG and Schneider Electronics AG were sold in an "asset deal" to the Chinese electronics company TCL.
The assets, patents and employees of Schneider Laser Technologies AG were transferred into a new company (Auffanggesellschaft) owned to 60 % by Jenoptik, Laser, Optik, Systeme GmbH (LOS) and to 40 % by the insolvency mass of Schneider Laser Technologies AG.
The bodies allegedly granting State aid The first alleged aid provider is the State-controlled Förderbank Bayern (LfA) bank.
The financial measures in chronological order The Complainant claimed unlawful aid to Schneider AG in the following measures: 1.
A EUR 5,1 million (DM 10 million) loan granted in 1993 by LfA to Schneider AG; 2.
A subsidy of EUR 9050121,88 provided to Schneider AG by the Bavarian Research Fund in the period of 1995-1999; 3.
LfA's purchase of 250000 shares in Schneider AG and its participation in the capital increase of EUR 23 million (DM 45 million) in September and October 1998; 4.
LfA's consideration of EUR […] [1] paid in November 1999 to the Complainant in exchange for cancellation of the Complainant's compensation right (Nachbesserungsrecht).
The Complainant was allegedly obliged to provide the compensation amount to Schneider AG as a loan, therefore the claim related to an aid indirectly provided by LfA to Schneider AG; 5.
Three loans provided in 1999 and 2000 by LfA to Schneider AG, amounting altogether to EUR 12,8 million.
Assessment Existence of aid The Commission has concluded that measures No 1, 3 and 4 do not involve State aid or are compatible with the common market.
As regards the other measures from LfA During the period September 1999-February 2000, three loans were provided by LfA to Schneider AG: EUR 2,1 million and EUR 5,1 million in September 1999 and EUR 5,6 million in February 2000.
Germany submitted that the purpose of the three loans was to ensure the maintenance of the EUR 31 million credit line from the private pool banks.
Two further capital increases with Lehman Brothers as sole or lead investor in late 1999 and early 2000 also support Germany's view that the three loans meet the market economy investor test.
According the Germany, in late 1999 and early 2000 two capital increases were carried out in Schneider AG amounting to EUR 25 million and EUR 46 million.
The Complainant disputes these amounts and claims that capital increases by Lehman Brothers between September 1999 and February 2000 amounted to altogether only EUR 2,3 million.
Nevertheless, in 2001 the Commission approved the High Technologies scheme [2] for the period 2001-2005.
