On the basis of Article 87(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty, State aid granted to promote the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas within the European Union may be considered to be compatible with the common market by the Commission.
Increased levels of investment aid granted to small and medium-sized enterprises located within the disadvantaged regions over and above what is allowed in other areas are also considered as regional aid. 2.
This geographical specificity distinguishes regional aid from other forms of horizontal aid, such as aid for research, development and innovation, employment, training or the environment, which pursue other objectives of common interest in accordance with Article 87(3) of the Treaty, albeit sometimes with higher rates of aid in the disadvantaged areas in recognition of the specific difficulties which they face [1]. 3.
The criteria applied by the Commission when examining the compatibility of national regional aid with the common market under Articles 87(3)(a) and 87(3)(c) of the EC Treaty have been codified in the 1998 guidelines on national regional aid [2] which cover the period 2000-2006 [3].
Furthermore, the advantages of the aid in terms of the development of a less-favoured region must outweigh the resulting distortions of competition [5].
The weight given to the advantages of the aid is likely to vary according to the derogation applied, so that a greater distortion of competition can be accepted in the case of the most disadvantaged regions covered by Article 87(3)(a) than in those covered by Article 87(3)(c) [6]. 6.
This incompatibility also applies to large individual aid grants made in this sector to small and medium-sized enterprises within the meaning of Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 [10], or any successor regulation, which are not exempted by the same Regulation.
In addition, due to its specific characteristics, no regional investment aid may be granted in the synthetic fibres sector as defined in Annex II. 9.
Aid may only be granted to firms in difficulties within the meaning of the Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty [11] in accordance with the latter guidelines. [12] 10.
If aid granted under a scheme appears to be unduly concentrated on a particular sector of activity, the Commission may review the scheme pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 on modalities for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty [13] and may propose, in line with Article 18 (c) of this Regulation, to abolish the scheme. 11.
Member States do not have to notify national regional aid schemes which fulfil all the conditions laid down in the group exemption Regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty establishing the European Community to certain categories of horizontal State aid [14]. 3.
Demarcation of regions 3.1.
Accordingly, it has decided to fix the limit for the overall population coverage to 42 % of the population of the current Community of 25 Member States, which is similar to the limit fixed on the basis of a Community of 15 members in 1998.
This notwithstanding, in order to ensure a sufficient degree of continuity for the existing Member States, the Commission has also decided to apply an additional safety net to ensure that no Member State loses more than 50 % of the coverage of its population covered during the period 2000-2006 [16]. 3.2.
The derogation in Article 87(3)(a) 15.
The Commission accordingly considers that the conditions laid down are fulfilled if the region, being a NUTS [18] level II geographical unit, has a per capita gross domestic product (GDP), measured in purchasing power standards (PPS), of less than 75 % of the Community average [19].
In recognition of the special handicaps which they face by reason of their remoteness and specific constraints in integrating into the internal market, the Commission considers that regional aid for the outermost regions covered by Article 299(2) of the Treaty [22] also falls within the scope of the derogation in Article 87(3)(a), whether or not the regions concerned have a GDP per capita of less than 75 % of the Community average. 3.3.
For certain regions, the GDP per capita exceeds 75 % of the Community average solely because of the statistical effect of enlargement.
These are regions at NUTS II level which have a GDP per capita of more than 75 % of the EU-25 average, but less than 75 % of the EU-15 average [23] [24]. 19.
In order to ensure that the past progress of these regions is not undermined by too rapid change, in terms of aid intensities and the availability of operating aid, the Commission considers that they should continue to remain eligible for the derogation in Article 87(3)(a) on a transitional basis until 31 December 2010. 20.
If the relative GDP per capita of any of the regions has declined below 75 % of the EU-25 average, the regions concerned will continue to be eligible for the derogation under Article 87(3)(a).
Otherwise the statistical effect regions will become eligible for aid under the derogation of Article 87(3)(c) from 1 January 2011. 3.4.
The derogation in Article 87(3)(c) 21.
So as to afford national authorities sufficient latitude when it comes to choosing eligible regions without jeopardizing the effectiveness of the system of checks and balances operated by the Commission in respect of this type of aid and the equal treatment of all Member States, the selection of the regions eligible under the derogation in question should be undertaken by a two-step process which consists, first, of the determination by the Commission of the maximum population coverage for each Member State [26] for such aid, and, secondly, of the selection of eligible regions. 3.4.1.
Determination of eligible national population coverage 24.
Since these regions [27] have previously benefited from a relatively high level of aid, the Commission considers it necessary to allow Member States the flexibility, if they so wish, to continue to support these regions for the duration of these guidelines, under the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) [28]. 26.
After deducting the population coverage resulting from the application of the objective criteria set out in sections 3.2 and 3.3, as well as the allocations referred to in the two preceding paragraphs from the upper limit of 42 % of EU-25 population determined in section 3.1, the balance is available for distribution between the Member States using a distribution key that takes account of variations in GDP per capita and unemployment between the regions, both in a national and a Community context.
The detailed formula is set out in Annex IV [30]. 28.
Finally, as indicated in section 3.1, a safety net is applied to ensure that no Member State loses more than 50 % of the coverage of its population under the 1998 guidelines. 29.
Selection of eligible regions [31] 30.
Accordingly, the Commission considers that the following regions may be eligible for selection by the Member States concerned for the award of regional investment aid pursuant to the derogation under Article 87(3)(c) [32]: (a) the "economic development" regions; (b) the low population density regions: such areas are made up essentially of NUTS-II geographic regions with a population density of less than 8 inhabitants per km2, or NUTS-III geographic regions with a population density of less than 12.5 inhabitants per km2 [33].
However, a certain flexibility is allowed in the selection of these areas, subject to the following limitations: - flexibility in the selection of areas must not mean an increase in the population covered; - the NUTS III parts qualifying for flexibility must have a population density of less than 12.5 inhabitants per square kilometer; - they must be contiguous with NUTS III regions which satisfy the low population density test; (c) regions which form contiguous zones with a minimum population of at least 100000 and which are located within either NUTS-II or NUTS-III regions which have either a GDP per capita of less than the EU-25 average, or which have an unemployment rate which is higher than 115 % of the national average, (both calculated on the average of the most recent 3 years of Eurostat data); (d) NUTS-III regions with less than 100000 population which have either a GDP per capita of less than the EU-25 average or which have an unemployment rate which is higher than 115 % of the national average, (both calculated on the average of the most recent three years of Eurostat data); (e) islands and other regions categorised by similar geographical isolation [34] which have either a GDP per capita of less than the EU-25 average, or which have an unemployment rate which is higher than 115 % of the national average, (both calculated on the average of the most recent three years of Eurostat data); (f) islands with fewer than 5000 inhabitants and other communities with fewer than 5000 inhabitants categorised by similar geographical isolation; (g) NUTS-III regions or parts thereof adjacent to a region which is eligible for support under Article 87(3)(a) as well as NUTS-III regions or parts thereof which share a land border, or a sea border of less than 30 kilometres with a country which is not a Member State of the European Economic Area or EFTA. (h) In duly justified cases, Member States may also designate other regions which form contiguous zones with a minimum population of at least 50000 which are undergoing major structural change, or are in serious relative decline, when compared with other comparable regions.
In addition, in order to allow Member States greater flexibility to target very localised regional disparities, below the NUTS-III level, Member States may also designate other smaller areas which do not meet the conditions described above provided they have a minimum population of 20000 [35].
However, because of the potential distortion of competition resulting from the spill-over effect into the more prosperous surrounding regions, the Commission will not approve aid for investments by large companies in these areas, or aids for investments with eligible expenses exceeding EUR 25 million. 32.
Regional investment aid 4.1.
Regional investment aid is aid awarded for an initial investment project. 34.
Replacement investment which does not meet any of these conditions is thus excluded from the concept [36]. 35.
Regional investment aid is calculated either in reference to material and immaterial investment costs resulting from the initial investment project or to (estimated) wage costs for jobs directly created by the investment project [38]. 37.
An express reference to both conditions must also be included in all aid schemes [41].
Where the aid is calculated on the basis of material or immaterial investment costs, or of acquisition costs in the case referred to in paragraph 35, to ensure that the investment is viable and sound and respecting the applicable aid ceilings, the beneficiary must provide a financial contribution of at least 25 % of the eligible costs, either through its own resources or by external financing, in a form which is free of any public support [42]. 40.
Furthermore, in order to ensure that the investment makes a real and sustained contribution to regional development, aid must be made conditional, through the conditions attached to the aid, or its method of payment, on the maintenance of the investment in question in the region concerned for a minimum period of at least five years after its completion [43].
All aid intensities must be calculated in terms of gross grant equivalents (GGE) [44].
In fact, a significant number of regions and indeed entire Member States now have a per capita GDP of below 45 % of the EU-25 average, which was not the case in 1998.
In the case of regions falling under Article 87(3)(a), the Commission thus considers that the intensity of regional aid must not exceed: - 30 % GGE for regions with less than 75 % of average EU-25 GDP per capita, for outermost regions with higher GDP per capita and until 1 January 2011 statistical effect regions; - 40 % GGE for regions with less than 60 % of average EU-25 GDP per capita; - 50 % GGE for regions with less than 45 % of average EU-25 GDP per capita. 45.
In recognition of their specific handicaps, the outermost regions will be eligible for a further bonus of 20 % GGE if their GDP per capita falls below 75 % of the EU-25 average and 10 % GGE in other cases. 46.
The statistical effect regions which fall under the derogation under Article 87(3)(c) from 1 January 2011will be eligible for an aid intensity of 20 %. 47.
In the other Article 87(3)(c) regions, the ceiling on regional aid must not exceed 15 % GGE.
This is reduced to 10 % GGE in the case of regions with both more than 100 % of average EU-25 GDP per capita and a lower unemployment rate than the EU-25 average, measured at NUTS-III level (based on averages for the last three years, using Eurostat data) [45]. 48.
However, the low population density regions and regions (corresponding to NUTS-III level or smaller) adjoining a region with Article 87(3)(a) status selected by Member States for coverage under Article 87(3)(c), as well as NUTS-III regions or parts thereof which share a land border with a country which is not a Member State of the European Economic Area or EFTA, are always eligible for an aid intensity of 15 % GGE. 4.1.3.
In the case of aid awarded to small and medium-sized enterprises [46], the ceilings in section 4.1.2 may be increased by 20 % GGE for aid granted to small enterprises and by 10 % GGE for aid granted to medium-sized enterprises [47]. 4.2.
Eligible expenses 4.2.1.
Aid calculated on the basis of investment costs 50.
Expenditures on land, buildings and plant/machinery [48] are eligible for aid for initial investment. 51.
For SMEs, the costs of preparatory studies and consultancy costs linked to the investment may also be taken into account up to an aid intensity of 50 % of the actual costs incurred. 52.
In the event of an acquisition of the type referred to in paragraph 35, only the costs of buying assets [49] from third parties should be taken into consideration [50].
For large companies, such costs are eligible only up to a limit of 50 % of the total eligible investment expenditure for the project. 56.
Aid calculated on the basis of wage costs 57.
Any jobs lost during that 12 month period must therefore be deducted from the apparent number of jobs created during the same period [53]. 59.
For the purpose of these guidelines, a "large investment project" is an "initial investment" as defined by these guidelines with an eligible expenditure above EUR 50 million [54].
In two successive Multisectoral frameworks on regional aid for large investment projects in 1998 [56] and 2002 [57], the Commission reduced the maximum aid intensities for large investment projects to limit distortions of competition.
In the interests of simplification and transparency, the Commission has decided to integrate the provisions of the 2002 Multisectoral framework (MSF-2002) into the Regional aid guidelines for the period 2007-13. 63.
Member States are required to notify individually to the Commission any aid to be awarded to investment projects under an existing aid scheme if the aid proposed from all sources is more than the maximum allowable amount of aid that an investment with eligible expenditure EUR 100 million can receive under the scale and the rules laid down in paragraph 67 [60].
Aid intensity | 10 % | 15 % | 20 % | 30 % | 40 % | 50 % | Notification threshold | EUR 7,5 million | EUR 11,25 million | EUR 15,0 million | EUR 22,5 million | EUR 30,0 million | EUR 37,5 million | 65.
Whenever regional aid is granted on the basis of existing aid schemes for non-notifiable large investments projects, Member States must, within 20 working days starting from the granting of the aid by the competent authority, provide the Commission with the information requested in the standard form laid down in Annex III.
Regional investment aid for large investment projects is subject to an adjusted regional aid ceiling [61], on the basis of the following scale: Eligible expenditure | Adjusted aid ceiling | Up to EUR 50 million | 100 % of regional ceiling | For the part between EUR 50 million and EUR 100 million | 50 % of regional ceiling | For the part exceeding EUR 100 million | 34 % of regional ceiling | Thus, the allowable aid amount for a large investment project will be calculated according to the following formula: maximum aid amount = R × (50 + 0,50 × B + 0,34 × C), where R is the unadjusted regional aid ceiling, B is the eligible expenditure between EUR 50 million and EUR 100 million, and C is the eligible expenditure above EUR 100 million.
Where the total amount of aid from all sources exceeds 75 % of the maximum amount of aid an investment with eligible expenditure of EUR 100 million could receive, applying the standard aid ceiling in force for large enterprises in the approved regional aid map on the date the aid is to be granted, and where (a) the aid beneficiary accounts for more than 25 % of the sales of the product(s) concerned on the market(s) concerned before the investment or will account for more than 25 % after the investment, or (b) the production capacity created by the project is more than 5 % of the market measured using apparent consumption data [62] for the product concerned, unless the average annual growth rate of its apparent consumption over the last five years is above the average annual growth rate of the European Economic Area's GDP, the Commission will approve regional investment aid only after a detailed verification, following the opening of the procedure provided for in Article 88(2) of the Treaty, that the aid is necessary to provide an incentive effect for the investment and that the benefits of the aid measure outweigh the resulting distortion of competition and effect on trade between Member States [63]. 69.
The aid intensity ceilings laid down in sections 4.1 and 4.3 above apply to the total aid: - where assistance is granted concurrently under several regional schemes or in combination with ad hoc aid; - whether the aid comes from local, regional, national or Community sources. 72.
Where aid calculated on the basis of material or immaterial investment costs is combined with aid calculated on the basis of wage costs, the intensity ceiling laid down for the region concerned must be respected [67]. 73.
Where the expenditure eligible for regional aid is eligible in whole or in part for aid for other purposes, the common portion will be subject to the most favourable ceiling under the applicable rules. 74.
Regional investment aid shall not be cumulated with de minimis support in respect of the same eligible expenses in order to circumvent the maximum aid intensities laid down in these guidelines. 5.
Operating aid [68] 76.
It is for the Member State to demonstrate the existence and importance of any handicaps [70].
In addition, certain specific forms of operating aid can be accepted in the low population density regions and the least populated areas. 77.
Operating aid should in principle only be granted in respect of a predefined set of eligible expenditures or costs [71] and limited to a certain proportion of those costs. 78.
Because of the specific nature of financial and intra-group activities, as defined in Section J (codes 65, 66 and 67) and intra-group activities falling within the scope of Section K (code 74) of the NACE code, operating aid granted for these activities has only a very limited likelihood of promoting regional development but a very high risk of distorting competition, as stated in the Commission notice on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation [72].
Because it is intended to overcome delays and bottlenecks in regional development, except as provided for in paragraphs 80 and 81, operating aid should always be temporary and reduced over time, and should be phased out when the regions concerned achieve real convergence with the wealthier areas of the EU [73]. 80.
In derogation from the previous paragraph, operating aid which is not both progressively reduced and limited in time may only be authorised: - in the outermost regions, in so far as it is intended to offset the additional costs arising in the pursuit of economic activity from the factors identified in Article 299(2) of the Treaty, the permanence and combination of which severely restrain the development of such regions (remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, and economic dependence on a few products) [74]; - in the least populated regions, in so far as it is intended to prevent or reduce the continuing depopulation of these regions [75].
The least populated regions represent or belong to regions at NUTS-II level with a population density of 8 inhabitants per km2 or less and extend to adjacent and contiguous smaller areas meeting the same population density criterion. 81.
In addition, in the outermost regions and low population density regions, aid which is not both progressively reduced and limited in time and which is intended partly to offset additional transport costs may be authorized under the following conditions: - aid may serve only to compensate for the additional cost of transport, taking into account other schemes of assistance to transport.
The Commission will therefore only approve operating aid schemes for the duration of these guidelines. 83.
In order to verify the effects on trade and competition of operating aid schemes, Member States will be required to provide each year a single report in respect of each NUTS-II region in which operating aid is granted which provides a breakdown of total expenditure, or estimated income forgone, for each operating aid scheme approved in the region concerned and identifies the ten largest beneficiaries of operating aid in the region concerned [76], specifying the sector(s) of activity of the beneficiaries and the amount of aid received by each. 6.
Aid for newly created small enterprises 84.
The Commission will accordingly approve aid schemes which provide aid of up to a total of EUR 2 million per enterprise [77] for small enterprises with their economic activity in regions eligible for the derogation in Article 87(3)(a), and up to EUR 1 million per enterprise for small enterprises with their economic activity in regions eligible for the derogation in Article 87(3)(c).
Annual amounts of aid awarded for newly created small enterprises must not exceed 33 % of the abovementioned total amounts of aid per enterprise. 87.
The aid intensity may not exceed - in Article 87(3)(a) regions, 35 % of eligible expenses incurred in the first three years after the creation of the enterprise, and 25 % in the two years thereafter; - in Article 87(3)(c) regions, 25 % of eligible expenses incurred in the first three years after the creation of the enterprise, and 15 % in the two years thereafter. 89.
These intensities are increased by 5 % in Article 87(3)(a) regions with a GDP per capita of less than 60 % of the EU-25 average, in regions with a population density of less than 12.5 inhabitants/km2 and in small islands with a population of less than 5000, and other communities of the same size suffering from similar isolation. 90.
The Member State shall put in place the necessary system to ensure that the upper limits for the amount of aid and the relevant aid intensity in relation to the eligible costs concerned are not exceeded.
Transitional arrangements 7.1.
Reductions of aid intensities for regions remaining within Article 87(3)(a) on 1 January 2007 92.
Where the implementation of these guidelines will result in a reduction in maximum aid intensities of more than 15 percentage points, net to gross [79], the reduction may be implemented in two stages with the initial reduction of a minimum of 10 percentage points being applied on 1 January 2007, and the balance on 1 January 2011. 7.2.
Reductions of aid intensities in the economic development regions 93.
Provided the areas concerned are proposed by the Member State as eligible for regional aid under Article 87(3)(c) for the whole period 2007-2013, the reduction of aid intensities for the economic development regions may take place in two stages.
As necessary to meet the new aid intensities allowed under these guidelines, a final reduction shall be applied at the latest on 1 January 2011 [80]. 7.3.
For regions which lose their capacity to grant operating aid as a result of the loss of eligibility under Article 87(3)(a), the Commission can accept a linear phasing out of operating aid schemes over a two-year period from the date of the loss of eligibility to grant such aid. 7.4.
In order to facilitate the smooth transition of these regions to the reformed horizontal State aid regime which is progressively being put in place through the implementation of the State aid action plan, Member States may exceptionally designate additional regions to be eligible for regional aid under Article 87(3)(c) until 1 January 2009, provided that the following conditions are met: - the regions concerned were eligible for regional aid under Article 87(3)(c) on 31 December 2006; - the combined total population of the regions eligible for regional investment aid under Article 87(3)(c) pursuant to the allocation of population coverages referred to in paragraphs 27 and 28 and those designated in accordance with this provision shall not exceed 66 % of the national population eligible for regional aid under Article 87(3)(c) on 31 December 2006 [81]; - the maximum aid intensity permitted in the additional regions designated in accordance with this provision shall not exceed 10 %. 8.
The regions of a Member State eligible for regional investment aid under the derogations and the ceilings on the intensity of aid for initial investment [82] approved for each region together form a Member State's regional aid map.
These are the regions eligible for the derogation under Article 87(3)(a) and the statistical effect regions. (2) regions which are to be designated by Member States for eligibility for regional aid in accordance with Article 87(3)(c) up to the limit for population coverage determined in accordance with section 3.4.1. 100.
The Commission intends to apply these guidelines to all regional aid to be granted after 31 December 2006.
Regional aid awarded or to be granted before 2007 will be assessed in accordance with the 1998 guidelines on national regional aid. 106.
Since they must be coherent with the regional aid map, notifications of regional aid schemes, or ad hoc aid to be granted after 31 December 2006, cannot normally be considered complete until the regional aid map has been adopted for the Member State concerned in accordance with the arrangements described in section 8.
Accordingly, the Commission will not normally examine notifications of regional aid schemes which are to apply after 31 December 2006, or ad hoc aid to be granted after that date, until the adoption of the regional aid map for the Member State concerned [86].
The same applies to aid schemes for newly created small enterprises covered by section 6 of these guidelines. 107.
For these reasons, the Commission will propose the following appropriate measures to Member States pursuant to Article 88(1) of the Treaty: - without prejudice to Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 [87] on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty to State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 364/2004 [88] and to Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2204/2002 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid for employment [89], Member States shall limit the application in time of all existing regional aid schemes to aid to be granted on or before 31 December 2006; - where environment aid schemes allow regional investment aid to be granted for environmental investments pursuant to footnote 29 of the Community guidelines on State aid for environmental protection [90], Member States shall amend the relevant schemes in order to ensure that aid may only be granted after 31 December 2006 if it complies with the regional aid map in force on the date the aid is granted; - Member States shall as necessary amend other existing aid schemes in order to ensure that any regional bonuses such as those allowed for training aid, aid for research and development or environment aid may only be granted after 31 December 2006 in areas which are eligible for support under Article 87(3)(a) or (c) in accordance with the regional aid map adopted by the Commission in force on the date the aid is granted.
Regulation as amended by Regulation (EC) No 364/2004 (OJ L 63, 28.2.2004, p. 22). [11] OJ C 244, 1.10.2004, p. 2. [12] In particular, aid granted to large or medium-sized enterprises during the restructuring period must always be notified individually to the Commission, even if it is granted as part of an approved scheme. [13] OJ L 83, 27.3.1999, p. 1. [14] OJ L 142, 14.5.1998, p. 1. [15] This 42 % limit is estimated to rise to 45,5 % on an EU-27 basis following the Accession of Bulgaria and Romania. [16] Application of the safety net will lead to a total population coverage of about 43.1 % on an EU-25 basis, or 46,6 % on an EU-27 basis. [17] Case 248/84, Germany v Commission [1987, ECR 4013, paragraph 19. [18] Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) OJ L 154, 21.6.2003, p. 1.
The NUTS nomenclature is used by EUROSTAT as a reference for the collection, development and harmonisation of EU regional statistics and for socio-economic analyses of the regions. [19] The underlying assumption being that the GDP indicator is capable of reflecting synthetically both the phenomena mentioned. [20] In this, and all subsequent references to GDP per capita in these guidelines, GDP is measured in terms of purchasing power standards. [21] The data cover the period 2000-2002. [22] Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Réunion and French Guyana. [23] In practice, 75 % of the average EU-15 GDP per capita corresponds to 82,2 % of the average EU-25 GDP per capita. [24] These regions are subsequently referred to as the "statistical effect" regions. [25] Footnote 17, supra. [26] With the exception of Member States whose entire territory is eligible for the derogation under Article 87(3)(a). [27] Subsequently referred to as the "economic development" regions. [28] Although it was not eligible for aid pursuant to Article 87(3)(a), Northern Ireland has in fact benefited during the period 2000-2006 from the same aid intensities as many of the Article 87(3)(a) regions.
These cases have to be individually notified to the Commission. [51] The wage cost means the total amount actually payable by the beneficiary of the aid in respect of the employment concerned, comprising the gross wage, before tax, and the compulsory social security contributions. [52] The number of employees means the number of annual labour units, namely the number of persons employed full time in one year, part-time and seasonal work being ALU fractions. [53] Such a definition holds true as much for an existing establishment as for a new establishment. [54] The EUR 50 million must be calculated at prices and exchange rates on the date when the aid is granted, or in the case of large investment projects where individual notification is required, at prices and exchange rates at the date of the notification. [55] To assess whether an initial investment is economically indivisible, the Commission will take into account the technical, functional and strategic links and the immediate geographical proximity.
This implies that to establish whether a large investment project constitutes a single investment project, the assessment should be the same irrespective of whether the project is carried out by one undertaking, by more than one undertakings sharing the investment costs or by more undertakings bearing the costs of separate investments within the same investment project (for example in the case of a joint venture). [56] OJ C 107, 7.4.1998, p. 7. [57] OJ C 70, 19.3.2002, p. 8 as amended by OJ C 263, 1.11.2003, p. 1. [58] Individually notifiable investment projects will be assessed in accordance with the rules in force at the time of notification. [59] Given the wide general scope of these guidelines, the Commission decided that it is not technically feasible to proceed with the establishment of a list of sectors where serious structural difficulties prevail. [60] Ad hoc individual aid must always be notified to the Commission.
Because of its clear effect on the conditions of trade and competition, the need for a specific justification for the link with regional development applies with greater force to ad hoc individual aid for large individual investment projects. [61] The starting point for the calculation of the adjusted aid ceiling is always the maximum aid intensity allowed for aid for large enterprises in accordance with section 4.1.2 above.
No SME bonuses may be granted to large investment projects. [62] Apparent consumption of the product concerned is production plus imports minus exports. [63] Before the entry into force of these guidelines the Commission will draw up further guidance on the criteria it will take into account during this assessment. [64] Where an investment project involves the production of several different products, each of the products needs to be considered. [65] If the Member State demonstrates that the aid beneficiary creates a new product market, the tests laid down in paragraph 68 (a) and (b) do not need to be carried out, and the aid will be authorised under the scale in paragraph 67.

[67] This condition is deemed to be met if the sum of the aid for the initial investment, expressed as a percentage of the investment, and of the job creation aid, expressed as a percentage of wage costs, does not exceed the most favourable amount resulting from application of either the ceiling set for the region in accordance with the criteria indicated at section 4.1 or the ceiling set for the region in accordance with the criteria indicated at section 4.3. [68] Like other forms of regional aid, the granting of operating aid is always subject to the specific rules which may apply in particular sectors. [69] Operating aid takes the form in particular of tax exemptions or reductions in social security contributions which are not linked to eligible investment costs. [70] The Commission is currently studying the feasibility of establishing a methodology for evaluating the additional costs in the outermost regions. [71] For example, replacement investments, transport costs or labour costs. [72] OJ C 384, 10.12.1998, p. 3. [73] This principle of degressivity must also be respected when new operating aid schemes are notified to replace existing ones.
However, flexibility as regards the application of this principle may be permitted in the case of operating aid schemes designed to address the geographical handicaps of particular areas located within Article 87(3)(a) regions. [74] In view of the constraints faced by the outermost regions, except in the cases referred to in paragraph 78, the Commission considers that operating aid of up to 10 % of the turnover of the beneficiary may be awarded without the need for specific justification.
Regions at the NUTS-III level definition must have a GDP per capita below 85 % or an unemployment level of more than 115 % of the national average (MS = 100).
The introduction of these corrections implies that regions in richer Member States should show a lower GDP per capita in comparison with the national average in order to qualify for the criteria of sufficient disparity.
After application of the mentioned correction formulas the thresholds for the Netherlands shift from 85 to 77,2 for GDP per capita and from 115 to 150 for unemployment.
The population for all the NUTS-III areas that verify these criteria are added together for each Member State.
If the decision of the Commission is to allow coverage of 42 % of the EU-25 population to live in assisted areas, the population of all assisted Article 87(3)(a) and earmarked Article 87(3)(c) areas are deducted from this figure.
In addition and also since it is not feasible to prove any internal disparity for Member States with no NUTS-III regional breakdown (Luxemburg and Cyprus) a safety net is applied to guarantees that no Member State can have its assisted areas coverage reduced by more than 50 % Article (87(3)(a) and (c) areas taken together) than that under the 1998 Regional Aid Guidelines.
The aim is to ensure that all Member States are allocated a margin providing sufficient flexibility for an effective regional development policy. --------------------------------------------------
