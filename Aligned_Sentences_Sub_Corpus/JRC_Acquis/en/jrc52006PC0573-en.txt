DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS 5.1.
Objectives pursued The objective is for the two candidate countries with which the agreements have been negotiated to participate, before their accession to the European Union, in the notification system for technical regulations established by Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC.
A simplified notification system (with a maximum standstill period of three months and the possibility to make comments only) applies to the countries of the European Economic Area and, as of 1 January 2001, to Turkey also.
Measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation The ex ante evaluation revealed the following: - It is in the interests of the European Community and of its Member States to conclude such agreements in that the system envisaged will allow them to be kept regularly informed of the regulatory initiatives under preparation in the candidate countries and, then, where appropriate, to make comments on drafts which would have serious legal and economic implications, particularly from the point of view of the free movement of products and information society services (among other matters, for example, for Community subjects or enterprises operating in the candidate countries). - Furthermore, the application, in simplified form, of a procedure which will apply fully from accession will enable all the parties to prepare for that accession and thus to implement Community obligations correctly 5.1.3.
Measures taken following ex post evaluation None . 5.2.
Methods of implementation Action 1 The computer application necessary for the automatic transmission of texts from the Community Member States to the candidate countries and vice versa is already in place due to the previous exercise with former candidate countries prior to May 1 2004 (See COM(2003) 203 final.
Action 2 In line with the notification procedure established with the European Economic Area countries, the candidate countries will have to make their notifications in one of the official Community languages.
This figure has to be doubled with regard to both Bulgarian and Romanian notifications, because a text notified in English, for example, will be translated into French and German (5 x 20 x 2 = 200 pages).
The cost is therefore estimated at € 14 000 (400 pages at € 35 / page).
This amount will be funded from DG Enterprise and Industry’s existing budget (02.0301), which already provides for a slight increase in translation costs for 2006 in view of the preparation for enlargement.
Action 3 DG Enterprise and Industry will be responsible for: - coordinating the analysis of the drafts by the other departments concerned within the Commission; - coordinating with the Member States comments on the candidate countries' texts and the replies to the comments from the candidate countries on the Member States' texts; - managing the database and translations, and forwarding of messages.
