Similarly, it is appropriate to introduce provisions on family-related leave and, more particularly, the right to more flexible maternity leave, paternity leave, adoption and parental leave as well as leave in case of serious illness of a family member. (22) In the interest of guaranteeing that the purchasing power of Community officials develops in parallel with that of national civil servants in central government of the Member States, it is essential to preserve the principle of a multi-annual adjustment mechanism for pay, known as %quot%the Method%quot%, by extending its application until 31 December 2012 with a review after four years for consistency with budgetary discipline. (23) The advantages for officials of a multi-annual pay adjustment system should be balanced by the introduction of a special levy to reflect the costs of social policy, improved working conditions and the European Schools.

Article 14 At the request of Eurostat, Member States shall inform Eurostat of any factors having a direct or indirect impact on the composition and changes in the remuneration of central government civil servants.
CHAPTER 7 FINAL PROVISION AND REVIEW CLAUSE Article 15 1.
In order to determine the contribution of officials to the pension scheme referred to in Article 83(2) of the Staff Regulations, the Commission shall, every five years starting in 2004, carry out the actuarial assessment of the balance of the pension scheme referred to in Article 83a(3) of the Staff Regulations.
In preparation for the examination referred to in Article 83a(4) of the Staff Regulations, the Commission shall every year update this actuarial assessment, having regard to changes in the population as defined in Article 9 of this Annex, in the interest rate as defined in Article 10 of this Annex and in the rate of annual change in the salary scales of EC officials as defined in Article 11 of this Annex. 3.
The assessment and updates shall be carried out in each year n, on the basis of the population of active members of the pension scheme at 31 December of the previous year (n-1).
The adjustment taking effect on 1 July 2005 shall not lead to a contribution higher than 10,25 %. 3.
CHAPTER 2 ASSESSMENT OF THE ACTUARIAL BALANCE Article 3 The five-yearly actuarial assessments shall lay down the conditions for balance by taking into account, as charges on the scheme, the retirement pension as defined in Article 77 of the Staff Regulations, the invalidity allowance as defined in Article 78 of the Staff Regulations, survivors' pensions as defined in Articles 79 and 80 of the Staff Regulations.
Under the method, the %quot%actuarial value%quot% of the pension rights earned before the calculation date represents a past service liability, while the actuarial value of the pension rights that will be earned in the year of service beginning on the calculation date represents the %quot%service cost%quot%. 3.
All the relevant provisions provided for in these Staff Regulations (particularly in Annexes VIII and XIII) shall be taken into account in the actuarial evaluation of the service cost. 6.
The smoothing shall be obtained through a 12-year moving average for the interest rate and for the increase in the salary scales.
The contribution formula is based on the equation: %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% 2.
the actuarial value of the pension rights that will become payable to the active officials who are expected to become invalids during year n; and (c) the survivor's service cost (detailed in Article 8 of this Annex), i.e.
If the cumulated pension rights (rights from the recruitment, including transfers) credited to the official at 31 December of year n-1 are at least 70 % he will deemed not to have acquired any right to pension during year n. 2.
The projected basic salary (PS) at retirement shall be calculated starting from the basic salary at 31 December of the previous year and taking into account the rate of annual increase in the salary scales and the estimated annual rate of increase due to seniority and promotions as follows: %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% where: SAL= present salary GSG= estimated annual rate of General Salary Growth, (the rate of annual change in the salary scales) ISP= estimated annual rate of Increase due to Seniority and Promotions m= difference between the assumed age of retirement (r) and the official's present age (x) Since the calculations shall be made in real terms, net of inflation, the rate of annual change in the salary scales and the annual rate of increase due to seniority and promotions shall be rates of increases net of inflation. 3.
On the basis of the calculation of the pension rights earned by a given official, the actuarial value of those pension rights (and of the reversionary pensions linked to them) shall be calculated by multiplying the annual pension rights as defined above by the sum of: (a) an immediate deferred annuity at age x, deferred m years: %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% where: x= official's age at 31 December of year n-1 τ= interest rate kpx= probability of a person of age x still being alive in k years m= difference between the assumed age of retirement (r) and the official's present age (x) GSG= estimated annual rate of General Salary Growth, (the rate of annual change in the salary scales) ω= ceiling of the mortality table; and (b) an immediate deferred reversionary annuity at ages x and y, where y is the assumed age of the spouse.
This latter annuity shall be multiplied by the probability of the official of being married and by the applicable reversion rate established in accordance with Annex VIII: %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% where: x= official's age at 31 December of year n-1 y= age of the official's spouse at 31 December of year n-1 τ= interest rate kpx= probability of an official of age x still being alive in k years kpy= probability of a person of age y (spouse of the official of age x) still being alive in k years m= difference between the assumed age of retirement (r) and the official's present age (x) GSG= estimated annual rate of General Salary Growth, (the rate of annual change in the salary scales) ω= ceiling of the mortality table. 4.
This information shall be collected annually by the Commission using information received from the different institutions and agencies whose staff are members of the scheme.
From the observation of this population shall be deduced in particular the structure of the population, the average age of retirement and the invalidity table. 2.
The effective annual rate to be taken into consideration for the actuarial calculations shall be the average of the real average interest rates for the 12 years preceding the current year.
The annual change in the salary scales of officials to be taken into consideration for the actuarial calculations shall be based on the specific indicators referred to in Article 1(4) of Annex XI. 2.
The effective annual rate to be taken into consideration for the actuarial calculations shall be the average of the net specific indicators for the European Union for the 12 years preceding the current year.
Article 12 The rate in Articles 4 and 8 of Annex VIII for the calculation of compound interest shall be the effective rate referred to in Article 10 of this Annex and shall, if necessary, be revised on the occasion of the five-yearly actuarial assessments.
CHAPTER 4 IMPLEMENTATION Article 13 1.
Eurostat shall be assisted by one or more qualified independent experts in carrying out the actuarial assessments referred to in Article 1 of this Annex.
Eurostat shall provide such experts with, in particular, the parameters referred to in Articles 9 to 11 of this Annex. 3.
