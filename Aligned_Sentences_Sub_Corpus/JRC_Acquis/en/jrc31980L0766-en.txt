For the Commission Etienne DAVIGNON Member of the Commission (1)OJ No L 44, 15.2.1978, p. 15.
Furthermore, the combined 4.2 and 4.3 system must allow the signal obtained with a solution containing 0 702 mg VC/litre DMA or 0 702 mg VC/kg DMA to be equal to at least five times the background noise. 4.4.
Preparation of concentrated standard VC solution at approximately 2 000 mg/kg Accurately weigh to the nearest 0 71 mg a suitable glass vessel and place in it a quantity (e.g. 50 ml) of DMA (3.2).
The concentration of the resultant dilute standard solution is expressed as mg/l or mg/kg respectively. 5.3.
Add to each phial volumes of dilute standard VC solution (5.2) and DMA (3.2) or internal standard solution in DMA (3.3) such that the final VC concentration of the duplicate solutions will be approximately equal to 0 ; 0 7050 ; 0 7075 ; 0 7100 ; 0 7125 ; 0 7150 ; 0 7200, etc.
Validation of preparation of standard solutions obtained in points 5.1 and 5.2 Repeat the procedure described under points 5.1 and 5.2 to obtain a second diluted standard solution with a concentration equal to 0 71 mg VC/l or 0 71 mg/kg of DMA or internal standard solution.
If the difference is greater than 5 %, reject all the solutions obtained in points 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 and repeat the procedure from the beginning. 5.5.
Add to each phial for each gram of the sample 10 ml or 10 g of DMA (3.2) or 10 ml or 10 g of internal standard solution (3.3).
The concentration of VC in the material and article under investigation expressed in mg/kg shall be the average of the two concentrations of VC (mg/kg) determined in point 6.1 provided that the repeatability criterion in point 8 is satisfied. 7.
