This Directive lays down provisions for: (a) the monitoring and classification of bathing water quality; (b) the management of bathing water quality; and (c) the provision of information to the public on bathing water quality. 2.
CHAPTER II QUALITY AND MANAGEMENT OF BATHING WATER Article 3 Monitoring 1.
Member States shall ensure that monitoring of the parameters set out in Annex I, column A, takes place in accordance with Annex IV. 3.
The monitoring point shall be the location within the bathing water where: (a) most bathers are expected; or (b) the greatest risk of pollution is expected, according to the bathing water profile. 4.
They shall be replaced by samples taken in accordance with Annex IV. 7.
Member States shall ensure that the analysis of bathing water quality takes place in accordance with the reference methods specified in Annex I and the rules set out in Annex V.
However, Member States may permit the use of other methods or rules if they can demonstrate that the results obtained are equivalent to those obtained using the methods specified in Annex I and the rules set out in Annex V.
Article 4 Bathing water quality assessment 1.
However, provided that either: - the requirement of paragraph 3 is satisfied, or - the set of bathing water data used to carry out the assessment comprises at least eight samples, in the case of bathing waters with a bathing season not exceeding eight weeks, a bathing water quality assessment may be carried out on the basis of a set of bathing water quality data relating to fewer than four bathing seasons if: (a) the bathing water is newly identified; (b) any changes have occurred that are likely to affect the classification of the bathing water in accordance with Article 5, in which case the assessment shall be carried out on the basis of a set of bathing water quality data consisting solely of the results for samples collected since the changes occurred; or (c) the bathing water had already been assessed in accordance with Directive 76/160/EEC, in which case equivalent data gathered under that Directive shall be used and, for this purpose, parameters 2 and 3 of the Annex to Directive 76/160/EEC shall be deemed to be equivalent to parameters 2 and 1 of column A of Annex I to this Directive. 5.

Article 10 Cooperation on transboundary waters Wherever a river basin gives rise to transboundary impacts on bathing water quality, the Member States involved shall cooperate as appropriate in implementing this Directive, including through the appropriate exchange of information and joint action to control those impacts.
CHAPTER III EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION Article 11 Public participation Member States shall encourage public participation in the implementation of this Directive and shall ensure the provision of opportunities for the public concerned: - to find out how to participate, and - to formulate suggestions, remarks or complaints.
Article 12 Information to the public 1.
The information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be disseminated as soon as it is available and with effect from the start of the fifth bathing season after 24 March 2008. 4.
Article 13 Reports 1.
Member States shall provide this information annually by 31 December in relation to the preceding bathing season.
They shall do so for the first time before the start of the first bathing season after 24 March 2008. 3.
When monitoring of bathing water has started under this Directive, annual reporting to the Commission in accordance with paragraph 1 shall continue to take place pursuant to Directive 76/160/EEC until a first assessment can be made under this Directive.
During that period, parameter 1 of the Annex to Directive 76/160/EEC shall not be taken into account in the annual report, and parameters 2 and 3 of the Annex to Directive 76/160/EEC shall be assumed to be equivalent to parameters 2 and 1 of column A of Annex I to this Directive. 4.
The Commission shall publish this report by 30 April every year, including via the Internet.
CHAPTER IV FINAL PROVISIONS Article 14 Report and review 1.
Article 15 Technical adaptations and implementing measures 1.
The Commission shall present a draft of the measures to be taken in accordance with paragraph 1(b) with respect to Article 12(1)(a) by 24 March 2010.

Other relevant information may be attached or included if the competent authority considers it appropriate. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX IV Bathing water monitoring 1.
Sterilisation of sample bottles Sample bottles are: - to undergo sterilisation in an autoclave for at least 15 minutes at 121 oC, or - to undergo dry sterilisation at between 160 oC and 170 oC for at least one hour, or - to be irradiated sample containers obtained directly from manufacturer. 3.
The minimum content is generally 250 ml.
The sample is to be conserved at a temperature of around 4 oC, in a cool box or refrigerator (depending on climate) until arrival at the laboratory.
