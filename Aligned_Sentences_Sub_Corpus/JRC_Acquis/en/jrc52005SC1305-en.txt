The Council recommended that the Hungarian authorities take action in a medium-term framework in order to bring the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2008 in a credible and sustainable manner, in accordance with the path for deficit reduction specified in the Council Opinion of 5 July 2004 on Hungary’s convergence programme submitted in May 2004.
On 13 July 2005, the Commission adopted a communication to the Council[4], based on the information available at the time, including corrective measures decided by the Government in March and June totalling 1½% of GDP to compensate for slippages, and the firm commitment of the Hungarian government to carry out further measures if necessary.
Against this background it appeared that the targeted deficit of 3.6% of GDP for 2005 was within reach and that the Hungarian government had taken effective action in response to the Council recommendation of 8 March 2005 regarding the measures envisaged to achieve the 2005 deficit target by the deadline of 8 July 2005.
According to the September notification, the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2005 will remain below the 60% threshold, at 57.1%.
The Government submitted on 30 September a budget proposal for 2006 which contains a deficit target of 4.7% of GDP.
So far the Government has signalled that – in contrast to the plans contained in the updated convergence programme - it would shift expenditure related to the construction of new motorway to a PPP-style framework, and thus lower government investment expenditure in 2006 by 1.2% of GDP and that this shift would be compatible with ESA rules.
The revision of both the 2005 and 2006 deficit targets are furthermore clearly breaching another element of the March Council recommendation, notably to make the timing and implementation of any tax cuts conditional upon the achievement of the deficit targets of the convergence programme update.
Not only does the 2006 budget contain a substantial tax cut, but there has also been an advancement of the VAT cuts (on petrol) to October 2005.
It should be noted that the target of 3.6% for 2005 was contained in the December 2004 update of the convergence programme[8] and endorsed by the Council in its opinion thereupon. (ii) the target for 2006 contained in the convergence programme update and March 2005 Council recommendation has been abandoned in the recent budget for 2006.
Moreover, it considered that the continued commitment of the government to correct the excessive deficit by 2008 needed to be underpinned by decisive measures of further fiscal consolidation and a more determined pursuit of structural reforms.
The outcome for 2005 will be worse if further slippages occur (not excluded particularly on the expenditure side) and are also not compensated by corrective measures.
According to this notification, the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2005 will remain below the 60% threshold, at 57.1%.
Article 2 This decision is addressed to the Republic of Hungary.
To compare the recently notified deficit with the original target contained in the convergence programme update, the higher pension fund contribution of 1.3% of GDP as notified in September has to be removed which results in a deficit of 7.4% of GDP. [8] This includes the contribution to the second pillar pension scheme (which was notified at 1.1% of GDP in March 2005) whereas the original target set in the convergence programme update of December 2004 of 4.7% of GDP was still without this contribution.

[14] http://europa.eu.int/comm/economy_finance/about/activities/sgp/edp/com_ass_hu_22_dec_en.pdf [15] The difference to the previous target of 3.8% of GDP is based on the increase in the contribution to the second pillar pension scheme by 0.2 percentage point of GDP in the March 2005 fiscal notification. [16] This includes the standard recording of the purchase of military aircraft that add 0.5% of GDP to the announced new deficit target of 4.7% of GDP in 2006.
