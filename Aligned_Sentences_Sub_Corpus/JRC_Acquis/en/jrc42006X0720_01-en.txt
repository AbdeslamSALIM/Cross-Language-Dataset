Member States were invited by the European Council to adopt the necessary measures in their constitutional provisions and the Council and the Commission, each within the limits of its own competences, were invited to develop inter alia a common European blueprint for curricula vitae to be used on a voluntary basis, which would make it easier for educational and training institutions as well as employers to assess skills acquired and promote mobility. (2) The White Paper A new impetus for European youth of 21 November 2001 [1], with regard to the recognition of non-formal and informal learning, emphasises the need for a clearer definition of the concepts, of the skills acquired and of quality standards, a higher regard for those involved, greater recognition of these activities and greater complementarity with formal learning and training. (3) The Barcelona European Council on 15 and 16 March 2002 adopted a concrete work programme with the objective of making the education and training systems a worldwide quality reference by 2010.
It agreed that the three basic principles underlying this programme should be improved quality, facilitation of universal access, and opening to the wider world. (4) The Council Resolution on lifelong learning of 27 June 2002 [2] invites the Member States to encourage cooperation and effective measures to validate learning outcomes, crucial for building bridges between formal, non-formal and informal learning and thus a prerequisite for the creation of a European area of lifelong learning. (5) On the basis of the joint Commission and Council of Europe working paper Pathways towards Validation and Recognition of Education, Training and Learning in the Youth Field the January 2005 "Bridges for Recognition" conference in Leuven developed approaches towards the assessment and recognition of education, training and learning in the field of youth and underlined the need for a better validation of non-formal learning. (6) The comprehensive work of the Council of Europe in the field of non-formal and informal learning, for instance by means of a European Portfolio for Youth Leaders and Youth Workers, underlines the value of this type of educational experience and emphasises the need to recognise it, particularly given the significance of life-long learning. (7) The Conclusions of 28 May 2004 of the Council and of the representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, advocated, in accordance with the Copenhagen Declaration of 30 November 2002 [3]: - the adoption of a set of common European principles for the identification and validation of non-formal and informal learning; - the development and dissemination of European instruments to recognise non-formal and informal learning. (8) The Council Conclusions of 21 February 2005 [4] called on the European Council to integrate the European Pact for Youth initiative into the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and to adopt guidelines on concrete measures. (9) The Presidency Conclusions of the European Council of 23 March 2005, which agreed on the European Pact for Youth, state that a package of strategies and measures dedicated to youth should form a fully integrated part of the Lisbon Strategy.
