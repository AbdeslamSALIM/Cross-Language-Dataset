The final date for the authorised plantings under those schemes has been fixed at 31 December 2006.
The number of hectares to be taken into account for the determination of the number of payment entitlements referred to in Article 43 and Annex VII, point H, of Regulation (CE) No 1782/2003 is calculated by the Member States in olive GIS -ha according to the common method defined in annex XXIV of the Regulation (CE) No 1973/2004. 2.
The surface of the part of the area planted with other crops covered by the single payment scheme is determined in accordance with the integrated system provided for in Title II, Chapter 4 of Regulation (CE) No 1782/2003.
Where a Member State has made use of the option provided for in Article 71 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and decided to apply the single payment scheme in 2006, the rules laid down in Title III of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and in Chapters 1 to 6 of this Regulation shall apply. 2.

Where a Member State has applied the single payment scheme in 2005, the percentage of reduction fixed by the Member States in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall apply in 2006 to the tobacco, olive oil, cotton reference amounts to be integrated in the single payment scheme. 6.
If the farmer has not been allocated or has not bought payment entitlements by the last date for applying for the establishment of payment entitlements for 2006, he shall receive payment entitlements calculated in accordance with Articles 37 and 43 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 for tobacco, olive oil, cotton payments.
The first subparagraph shall apply also when the farmer has leased in payment entitlements for 2005 and/or 2006. 2.
Payment entitlements leased out before the date for lodging an application under the single payment scheme in 2006 shall be taken into account in the calculation referred to in paragraph 2.
It shall apply from 1 January 2006.
