Initiation (1) On 20 November 2004, the Commission announced by a notice (notice of initiation) published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2], the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding with regard to imports into the Community of certain iron or steel ropes and cables (SWR) originating in the Republic of Korea (Korea). (2) The anti-dumping proceeding was initiated following a complaint lodged on 11 October 2004 by the Liaison Committee of European Wire Rope Industries (EWRIS or the complainant) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 50 %, of the Community production of SWR.
Measures in force and on-going investigations concerning imports of SWR from other countries (3) In August 1999, by Regulation (EC) No 1796/1999 [3], the Council imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of steel ropes and cables (SWR) originating in the People’s Republic of China, Hungary, India, Mexico, Poland, South Africa and Ukraine.
By Regulation (EC) No 1678/2003 [5], the Commission withdrew the undertaking offered by the above Ukrainian exporting producer, and by Regulation (EC) No 1674/2003 [6], the Council re-imposed the corresponding ad valorem anti-dumping duty for this exporter. (4) By Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 [7], the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain iron or steel ropes and cables originating in the Czech Republic, Russia, Thailand and Turkey.
The measures applying to these imports consisted of an ad valorem duty, except for one Czech, one Russian, one Thai and two Turkish exporting producers from which undertakings were accepted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 230/2001 [8] and Commission Decision 2001/602/EC [9].
The two undertakings from Turkish exporting producers have been withdrawn by Commission Regulations (EC) No 2303/2002 [10] and No 1274/2003 [11]. (5) Thereafter, following an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the basic Regulation), it was found that circumvention of the measures concerning imports from the Ukraine and the People’s Republic of China took place via, respectively, Moldova and Morocco.
Consequently, the anti-dumping duty imposed on imports originating in the Ukraine was extended to imports of the same steel ropes and cables consigned from Moldova [12].
Similarly, the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on imports originating in the People's Republic of China was extended to imports of the same steel ropes and cables consigned from Morocco [13], with the exception of those produced by a genuine Moroccan producer. (6) Following the publication of a notice of impending expiry of the anti-dumping measures in force on SWR originating in the People’s Republic of China, Hungary, India, Mexico, Poland, South Africa and Ukraine [14], the Commission received, on 17 May 2004, a request to review these measures pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation. (7) This request was lodged by the Liaison Committee of European Union Wire Rope Industries (EWRIS) (the applicant) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 50 %, of the total Community production of SWR.
Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation. (11) In view of the large number of Community producers, Korean exporting producers and Community importers listed in the complaint, sampling was envisaged for these parties in the notice of initiation in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. (12) In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling would be necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all Community producers, Community importers and exporting producers were asked to make themselves known to the Commission and to provide, as specified in the notice of initiation, basic information on their activities related to the product concerned during the period 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004. (13) After examination of the information submitted by the exporting producers, three companies were selected for the sample on the basis of their export volumes to the Community.
The final sample consisted of the following companies: - Kiswire Ltd, - DSR Wire Corporation, - Chung-Woo Rope Co., Ltd. (14) As far as unrelated importers are concerned, only one importer actually importing the product concerned from the country concerned replied positively to the sampling form and expressed its willingness to further cooperate with the Commission services.
From the seventeen producers that expressed a willingness to cooperate further in the investigation, the following five companies were selected for the sample: - BTS Drahtseile GmbH (Germany), - Cables y Alambres especiales, SA (Spain), - CASAR Drahtseilwerk Saar GmbH (Germany), - Manuel Rodrigues de Oliveira Sa &amp; Filhos, SA (Portugal), - Trefileurope, SA (France). (16) The Commission sent questionnaires to the exporting producers and Community producers selected in the sample and all other parties known to be concerned.
Investigation period (18) The investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 (investigation period or IP).
Product concerned (19) The product concerned is ropes and cables, including locked coil ropes, of iron or steel but not stainless steel, with a maximum cross-sectional dimension exceeding 3 mm, with attached fittings or not originating in the Republic of Korea (the product concerned), normally declared within CN codes 73121082, 73121084, 73121086 and 73121088 and 73121099. 2.2.
Normal value 3.1.1.
Domestic sales of a particular type of SWR were considered sufficiently representative when the total domestic sales volume of that type during the IP represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the comparable type of SWR exported to the Community.
Normal value based on domestic prices of other producers in Korea (29) For product types falling under section 3.1.4(c), as well as for product types which were not sold by the exporting producers in representative quantities on the Korean domestic market, as mentioned in section 3.1.3, it was first considered whether for these product types sales prices of other domestic producers can be used in order to determine normal value.
Dumping margin for the companies investigated (43) According to Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, for each exporting producer the weighted average normal value was compared with the weighted average export price per product type, as determined above. (44) On the basis of the above, the dumping margin for the cooperating exporting producers, expressed as a percentage of the cif net free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty are: Kiswire Ltd – 8,4 %, DSR Wire Corporation 0,7 %, Chung-Woo Rope Co., Ltd – 6,1 %. (45) Regarding those cooperating exporters not included in the sample, it was found that, for the bulk of their sales, their export prices were generally in line with those of the sampled exporters.
Article 2 The Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
