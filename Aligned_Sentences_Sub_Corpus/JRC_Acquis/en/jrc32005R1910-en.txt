IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets requires an entity to recognise, or disclose information about, certain contingent liabilities.
In the context of a multi-employer plan, a contingent liability may arise from, for example: (a) actuarial losses relating to other participating entities because each entity that participates in a multi-employer plan shares in the actuarial risks of every other participating entity; or (b) any responsibility under the terms of a plan to finance any shortfall in the plan if other entities cease to participate. 35. [Deleted] Defined benefit plans that share risks between various entities under common control Paragraph 34 is amended and paragraphs 34A and 34B are added, as follows. 34.
An entity participating in such a plan shall obtain information about the plan as a whole measured in accordance with IAS 19 on the basis of assumptions that apply to the plan as a whole.
The other group entities shall, in their separate or individual financial statements, recognise a cost equal to their contribution payable for the period. 34B.
In measuring its defined benefit liability in accordance with paragraph 54, an entity shall, subject to paragraph 58A, recognise a portion (as specified in paragraph 93) of its actuarial gains and losses as income or expense if the net cumulative unrecognised actuarial gains and losses at the end of the previous reporting period exceeded the greater of: (a) 10 % of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at that date (before deducting plan assets); and (b) 10 % of the fair value of any plan assets at that date.
Actuarial gains and losses recognised outside profit or loss as permitted by paragraph 93A shall be presented in a statement of changes in equity titled "statement of recognised income and expense" that comprises only the items specified in paragraph 96 of IAS 1 (as revised in 2003).
The entity shall not present the actuarial gains and losses in a statement of changes in equity in the columnar format referred to in paragraph 101 of IAS 1 or any other format that includes the items specified in paragraph 97 of IAS 1. 93C.
They shall not be recognised in profit or loss in a subsequent period. 95.

IAS 8 applies when an entity changes its accounting policies to reflect the changes specified in paragraphs 159-159C.

If an entity applies the amendments to IAS 19 for an earlier period, these amendments shall be applied for that earlier period.
Paragraph 96 is amended to read as follows: 96.
In IAS 24 Related party disclosures (as revised in 2003), paragraph 20 is amended to read as follows: 20.
The following are examples of transactions that are disclosed if they are with a related party: (a) … (i) … Participation by a parent or subsidiary in a defined benefit plan that shares risks between group entities is a transaction between related parties (see paragraph 34B of IAS 19).
CONSENSUS Determining whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease 6.
If an arrangement contains a lease, the parties to the arrangement shall apply the requirements of IAS 17 to the lease element of the arrangement, unless exempted from those requirements in accordance with paragraph 2 of IAS 17.
In some cases, separating the payments for the lease from payments for other elements in the arrangement will require the purchaser to use an estimation technique.
For example, a purchaser may estimate the lease payments by reference to a lease agreement for a comparable asset that contains no other elements, or by estimating the payments for the other elements in the arrangement by reference to comparable agreements and then deducting these payments from the total payments under the arrangement. 15.
If a purchaser concludes that it is impracticable to separate the payments reliably, it shall: (a) in the case of a finance lease, recognise an asset and a liability at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset that was identified in paragraphs 7 and 8 as the subject of the lease.
An entity shall apply this interpretation for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
If an entity applies this interpretation for a period beginning before 1 January 2006, it shall disclose that fact.
IAS 8 specifies how an entity applies a change in accounting policy resulting from the initial application of an interpretation.
If an entity applies this Interpretation for an earlier period, these amendments shall be applied for that earlier period.
CONSENSUS Accounting for an interest in a fund 7.
The contributor shall recognise its obligation to pay decommissioning costs as a liability and recognise its interest in the fund separately unless the contributor is not liable to pay decommissioning costs even if the fund fails to pay. 8.
The contributor shall determine whether it has control, joint control or significant influence over the fund by reference to IAS 27, IAS 28, IAS 31 and SIC-12.
If it does, the contributor shall account for its interest in the fund in accordance with those Standards. 9.
A contributor shall disclose the nature of its interest in a fund and any restrictions on access to the assets in the fund. 12.
When a contributor has an obligation to make potential additional contributions that is not recognised as a liability (see paragraph 10), it shall make the disclosures required by paragraph 86 of IAS 37. 13.
When a contributor accounts for its interest in the fund in accordance with paragraph 9, it shall make the disclosures required by paragraph 85(c) of IAS 37.
An entity shall apply this Interpretation for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
If an entity applies this Interpretation to a period beginning before 1 January 2006, it shall disclose that fact.
Changes in accounting policies shall be accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8. -------------------------------------------------- Appendix Amendment to IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement The amendment in this appendix shall be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2006.
This Standard shall be applied by all entities to all types of financial instruments except: … (j) rights to payments to reimburse the entity for expenditure it is required to make to settle a liability that it recognises as a provision in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, or for which, in an earlier period, it recognised a provision in accordance with IAS 37. --------------------------------------------------
