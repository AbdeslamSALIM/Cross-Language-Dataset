To start this process in a coordinated manner in the EU, the Commission proposes to establish spectrum markets and seeks agreement at political level for the following objectives: In the period up to 2010, to put into practice at EU level: - The right to trade individual rights to use frequencies in a selection of spectrum bands for terrestrial electronic communications services - The right to use these frequencies in a flexible manner.
This approach no longer seems appropriate for electronic communication services in a world of accelerating technical development, where compartmentalisation of services becomes increasingly difficult in the light of their convergence.
The Commission has highlighted reform of spectrum management as one of the strategic issues in the i2010 initiative launched in June 2005.
A consultancy report[4] submitted in September 2004 by the Dutch Presidency to the Council proposed ” to move to a new and flexible model of spectrum allocation: the EU urgently needs to make its rigid spectrum allocation model flexible”.
It would rapidly improve the competitive position of the EU and deliver a strong impetus to innovation. 5.
CONCLUSIONS Reforming spectrum management in the EU to introduce a market-based approach to spectrum distribution constitutes a major challenge.
The Commission invites the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers to endorse the approach outlined in this Communication.
