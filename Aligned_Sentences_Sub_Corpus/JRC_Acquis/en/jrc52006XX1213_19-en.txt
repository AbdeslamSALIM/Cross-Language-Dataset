Written Procedure A Statement of Objections (%quot%SO%quot%) was adopted on 26 January 2005 and addressed to eighteen parties considered on a preliminary basis to have participated in the cartel or to bear liability thereof, namely: Akzo Nobel NV, and its subsidiaries Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding AB and EKA Chemicals AB; Degussa AG; Edison SpA; FMC Corporation and its subsidiary FMC Foret S.A.; Kemira OYJ; L'Air Liquide SA and its subsidiary: Chemoxal SA; Snia SpA, and its subsidiary Caffaro SpA; Solvay SA/NV and its subsidiary: Finnish Peroxides OY/AB; Solvay Solexis SpA (formerly Ausimont SpA); Total SA and its subsidiaries: Elf Aquitaine SA and Arkema SA.
Solexis and Solvay requested access to a number of monthly market reports drafted by Degussa.
In a decision taken under Article 8 of the Hearing Officers' Mandate, I took the view that they should be granted access to an edited version of these reports.
It is settled law (Judgement of the Court of First Instance of 15 March 2000 in joined cases T-25/95 and others, Cimenteries para 380 and subsequent) that the Commission is under no duty to provide the answers to the SO to all the parties.
Infractions committed and duration in relation to the quality of the proof - Air Liquide and Chemoxal were considered to be able to benefit from the statute of limitations, as far as fines are concerned, since their participation in the cartel could only be proven until 31 December 1997, and fines could not be imposed if they had ceased prior to 25 March 1998. - As a general rule, incriminating evidence which is based on a single accusation, contested by the company concerned and not corroborated by other evidence has not been retained, because the Commission has to carry the burden of proof.
