Without prejudice to Article 3, Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the concentration of asbestos emitted through the discharge ducts into the air during use of asbestos does not exceed a limit value of 0,1 mg/m3 (milligrams of abestos per m3 of air discharged). 2.
Member States may exempt from the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 the plants emitting less than 5 000 m3/hour total gaseous discharges, where the discharge of asbestos into the air is not more than 0,5 grams per hour at any time under normal operating conditions.
Article 5 Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that: (a) all aqueous effluent arising in the manufacture of asbestos cement is recycled.
However, the discharge of aqueous effluent containing not more than 30 grams of suspended matter per m3 of water may be authorized during routine cleaning or maintenance of the plant.
Article 7 Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that: - activities involving the working of products containing asbestos do not cause significant environmental pollution by asbestos fibres or dust, - the demolition of buildings, structures and installations containing asbestos and the removal therefrom of asbestos or materials containing asbestos involving the release of asbestos fibres or dust do not cause significant asbestos environmental pollution; to that end they shall satisfy themselves that the plan of work provided for in Article 12 of Directive 83/477/EEC prescribes the introduction of all the necessary preventive measures to this end.
Article 9 A Member State may, in order to protect health and the environment, introduce provisions which are more stringent than those of this Directive, in compliance with the conditions laid down by the Treaty.
Article 10 The procedure provided for in Articles 11 and 12 is established for the adaptation of the Annex to technical progress and shall be followed for any modification of the methods of sampling and analysis mentioned in the Annex.
This adaptation must not result in any direct or indirect modification of the limit values indicated in Articles 4 and 5.
Article 11 A Committee for the adaptation of this Directive to scientific and technical progress, hereinafter called 'the Committee', consisting of representatives of the Member States and chaired by a representative of the Commission, is hereby set up.
Member States shall adopt and publish the provisions necessary to comply with Articles 4 and 5 as soon as possible and in any case not later than 30 June 1991 for plants built or authorized before the date given in paragraph 1. 3.
Article 15 This Directive is addressd to the Member States.

DISCHARGE OF AQUEOUS EFFLUENT The reference method of analysis to determine total suspended matter (filterable matter from the non precipitated sample) as expressed in mg/l shall be filtering through a 0,45 mm filter membrane, drying at 105 °C and weighing (1).
This determination must be conducted to a precision (2) of ± 5 % and an accuracy (2) of ± 10 %.
Gravimetric method 1.
Where periodical measures are not taken, the limit value specified in Article 4 of the Directive applies to the total dust emissions.
The sampling must be conducted to a precision of ± 40 % and an accuracy of ± 20 % at the limit value.
The limit of detection must be 20 %.
Selecting the sampling point Sampling shall take place at a point where there is a laminar flow of air.
Under exceptional conditions, it is also necessary to measure the water vapour concentration so that the results can be amended accordingly. 7.
General requirements of the sampling procedure The procedure requires a sample of air from a duct carrying the emissions of asbestos dust to be drawn through a filter, and the asbestos content of the dust retained in the filter to be measured. 7.1.
The rate of leakage shall not exceed 1 % of the normal sampling flow. 7.2.
Normally sampling shall be conducted under isokinetic conditions. 7.3.
Nature of the sampler filter 8.1.
A minimum filtration efficiency of 99 % is required, as defined with reference to the DOP test using an aerosol with particles of 0,3 mm diameter. 9.
These results shall be expressed at normal temperature (273 K) and pressure (101,3 kPa).
Countable fibres method Where fibre counting procedures are used for the purpose of checking compliance with the limit value in Article 4 of the Directive, subject to the provisions of Article 6 (3) of the Directive, a conversion factor of two fibres/ml to 0,1 mg/m3 of asbestos dust may be used.
For the purposes of the Directive a fibre is defined as any object of length greater than 5 mm, breadth less than 3 mm, and having a length/breadth ratio greater than 3/1, which is countable by phase contrast optical microscopy using the European reference method defined in Annex I of Directive 83/477/EEC.
The method shall be capable of measuring the concentration of countable fibres in the emitted gases.
Where periodical measures are not taken, the limit value specified in Article 4 applies to the total dust emission.
Selecting the sampling point Sampling shall take place at a point where there is a laminar flow of air.
Under exceptional conditions, it is also necessary to measure the water vapour concentration so that the results can be amended accordingly. 6.
The rate of leakage shall not exceed 1 % of the normal sampling flow. 6.2.
The sampling head and the number of points where samples must be taken shall be determined in accordance with the national standard adopted. 7.
For the countable fibre method, membrane filters (mixed esters of cellulose or cellulose nitrate) of nominal pore size 5 mm, with printed squares and a diameter of 25 mm shall be used. 7.2.
Counting of fibres The fibre counting method shall conform to the European reference method, as set out in Annex I of Directive 83/477/EEC. 9.
These results shall be expressed at normal temperature (273 K) and pressure (101,3 kPa). (1) See Annex III to Directive 82/883/EEC (OJ No L 378, 31. 12. 1982, p. 1). (2) These items are defined in Article 2 of Directive 79/869/EEC (OJ No L 271, 29. 10. 1979, p. 44) as amended by Directive 81/855/EEC (OJ No L 319, 7. 11. 1981, p. 16).
