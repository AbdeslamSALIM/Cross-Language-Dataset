Of how we got the HEART of the deer.
In the town where we got the Efmeraldas, gave Dorantes over feifcientos HEART Deer open, they have great abundance for fu fiempre maintenance, i by efto pufimos you name, the People of the HEART, i for him is the entrance to many provinces, that eftàn à la Mar del Sur; i fi whom they are to bufcar, for here does not fit, lose faith; COFTA because no Corn, i eat dust Bledo, Straw i, i PEFC, which take the Ocean with BALF, because not reach Canoas.
The women cover with Yerva verguenças fus, i Paja.
People mui is timid, i Trift.
We believe that about COFTA, by way of those People who nofotros Trux, ai more than a thousand leagues of land populated, i have a lot of maintenance, because fiembran three times in the year Frifoles, i Corn.
Deer Ai three ways, those of vna of them fon sizes as Caftilla Steers: ai CAFAS of afiento, called Buhi, i have Yerva, i efto is VNOs trees, the size of Mançanos, i is not get over menefter Fruit, i vntar Arrow with her fine i have fruit, break vna Rama, i with Milk who have made it mefmo.
Ai eftos many trees, which ponçoñofos fon so that fi mash Sheets of it, i the laban in some water close to him, all the deer, i qualefquier other Animals that drink it, then rebientan.
In Pueblo EFTE eftuvimos three days, i day VNA alli eftaba other in the many water qual took us that long because no crefciò Rio vn you were unsuccessful in pafar, i fortnight we stopped there.
In EFTE time he saw the neck Caftillo Indian vn vna Efpada Evilleta of girdle of, i in her shoe nail cofido vn: tomòfela, i preguntamosle that crow was that?
i dixeronnos that havia come from Heaven.
Preguntamosle more, which who t?ída havia there?
i refpondieron that men who wore beards VNOs as nofotros, which come from Heaven havia, i arrived at that river, bringing horses i, i Lances Efpadas i, i havia speared that two of them as much as i difimuladamente that they were unsuccessful in wonder, què havia faith made those men?
Crow was that we had great laftima mui, Earth watch mui fertile hermofa i mui, mui full of water i, i de Rios, i see the places defpoblados, i burnt the people so skinny i, i ill, flight, i efcondida all, i like no fembraban, so hungry, faith had with Cortec Tree, i estate.
Of hunger efta à part nofotros reach around EFTE road because they could provide us ill, eftando defventurados so that parefcia who wanted faith to die.
Blankets Truxeronnos of which havia efcondido by Chriftianos, dieronnoslas i: i still contaronnos as at other times gone havia Chriftianos by the Earth, i havia deftruìdo, i burned Peoples, i carried half of Men, all the women i, i guys, i fus the hands that have faith havia efcapar, went huiendo.
As viam so dismayed, so OFAR stop anywhere, i neither wanted, nor could fembrar, or tilling the earth, before some of dexarfe eftaban die, i had it better than efto that fer efperar treated with such cruelty, as hafta there, i moftraban grandifimo nofotros pleasure, but feared that those who had arrived the border with Chriftianos, i war with them, we havia of abuse, i make pagafemos, Chriftianos against what they were doing.
But as God was fervent Nueftro Lord bring us hafta them comenençaronnos to fear, i abide, as pafados, i even something more, that there is little wonder: where faith sees clearly that all eftas People, attracted to fer Chriftianos fer à i à Mageftad obedience of Imperial, has de fer taken with good treatment, that way i mui ETFE is true, i other does not.
Eftos Village took us to VN, which EFTA in vn Sierra vna knife, i have faith in him by large fubir afpereça: i here, we found many people, that eftaba board, collected, for fear of the Chriftianos.
Mui Recibieronnos well, i dierronos quanto had, i dieronnos more than two thousand loads of corn, which gave those mammals, i hungry, you hafta havia brought us there, i other day from there four Menfageros defpachamos the Earth, as acoftumbrabamos do, so llamafen, i convocafen People all over that pudiefen; à vn Pueblo, efta three days there, i made efto, another day we left With all the people, that there eftaba: i fiempre Hallab raftro, havia where i stayed Final Chriftianos, i came across nueftros à Menfageros noon, they told us that no havia found People, who all walked the efcondidos Montes, huiendo because Chriftianos not matafen, i hiciefen Efclavos: the night i havia vifto pafada the Chriftianos, eftando them behind of VNOs trees, watching what they did, i saw how many Indians had in Chains: i of faith efto nofotros altered that came, i some faith they returned, to avifo the Earth, and came Chriftianos, many more do i efto, do not fi nofotros Dixer non hiciefen or tuviefen fear: i with faith efto afeguraron, i rejoiced greatly.
Nofotros Indians came then with a hundred leagues away, i we could not stop them that faith bolviefen fus à CAFAS; i by afegurarlos, slept there that night, another day i walk, i slept on the road figuiente i the day, those who havia EMBI by Menfageros, led us where they havia vifto the Chriftianos; i arrived Vifperas time, it became clear, havia told the truth that i know people who was on horseback, by Eftacas in Horses that havia eftado tied.
Defde here, whose faith called the Rio de Petutàn, hafta the Rio de Guzman Diego where he can haver hafta him where fupimos of Chriftianos defde, eighty leagues: i defde the people there where we took the waters, twelve leagues; i defde there, hafta la Mar del Sur, havia twelve leagues.
Efta across Earth, where reach Sierras, we Gold mueftras great, i Alcohol, iron, copper, other metals i.
Where the CAFAS eftàn of afiento is hot, therefore, that makes great heat in January.
Acia Defde there noon, Land that is defpoblada, hafta the North Sea, is defaftrada mui, i poor, where pafamos great, i unbelieveable hunger that i live for that land, i walk, is crudelifima People, i mui bad inclination, i coftumbres.
The Indians, who have Cafa of breath, i the back, CAFOs are no Gold, Silver i, nor are they able to haver advantage.
We saw raftro Defpues Chriftianos clear, i understood, how close eftabamos of them God we thank you very much Nueftro Lord, for loving us so facar of Trift, i mammal captivity; i efto pleasure that paired against, judge each VNO, when penfare at that time Eftuvimos Earth, the dangers i, i work because pafamos.
That night I prayed to WNV my Companions Chriftianos fuefe after that went by where were leaving Earth nofotros afegurada, i havia three days' journey.
They were hico bad faith efto, efcufandofe by canfancio, i work i WNV although each of them could do better than I, more fer tough, i more snot, but will vifta fu, another day in the morning I took with me to the Black, i eleven Indians, the raftro that i was, Figures Chriftianos to, I went through three locations, havia stayed where i EFTE day I walked ten miles, tomorrow's another day i reach four Chriftianos Horse, which refcibieron great alteration in me so eftrañamente veftido, in company i Indians.
Efpacio Eftuvieronme much time looking so stunned, I did not even speak, nor were right to ask me anything.
Yo I told them that I llevafen where Captain eftaba fu: i afi there were half a mile from where eftaba Diego de Alcaraz, who was the Captain, i defpues of haverlo talked, he told me that there eftaba mui lost because havia many days that no havia Indians have taken, i havia no where to go, because among them began to haver necefidad, i hunger dixe I like Gone were Dorantes, i Caftillo that ten leagues eftaban there, with many people who brought us havia i EMBI then three of horse, i fifty Indians, of what they brought: i the Black bolviò with them to guide them, i I remained there, i asked, I Teftimonio Dief by Year, Month, i, i Day, who arrived there havia, i the way they came, i did amphi.
Rio De ETFE, hafta Chriftianos the People of that faith called Sant Miguel, who is of the Governacion of the Province, who say New Galicia ai thirty leagues.
How EMBI by Chriftianos.
Pafados five days, Andrés Dorantes, i Alonfo of Caftillo with which havia gone for them, i brought over feifcientas Configo Perfonas, who were from that village, that Havia Chriftianos fubir Mount fact, i went efcondidos the Earth, which i hafta havia nofotros there to come, the facado havia de los Montes, I awarded the Chriftianos, i havia defpedido them all the other people, which brought havia hafta there, i come where I eftaba, Alcaraz begged me, they call the People embiafemos Peoples, which eftàn à vera del Rio, who went by the Forestry afcondidos Earth mandafemos them that i truxefen eating, although it was not menefter efto because they had care fiempre bring all what they could, then i EMBI Menfageros nueftros à llamafen that, i came feifcientas Perfonas, they brought us all the corn to reach, i VNAs they brought in pots covered with mud, in which the buried havia, i efcondido, i they brought us everything but they had, but nofotros Quifa not take it all, fine food, i gave everything else to Chriftianos, to each other as repartiefen; i pafamos efto defpues of many, i big quarrels with them because we wanted to make the Indians traìmos Efclavos; i with ETFE anger, the breaking we left many Turquefcos Arcos, which he had, many Çurrones i, i Arrows, i including five in the Efmeraldas, faith not remember them, i amphi we lost.
We gave Vaca Chriftianos many blankets, i other mastheads that brought: Vimon with the Indians in much work, because faith bolviefen fus à CAFAS, i faith afegurafen, i fembrafen fu Corn.
They did not want fine go with nofotros, hafta dexarnos as acoftumbraban with other Indians, because faith bolviefen fi In order to efto, feared that faith would die, who to go with nofotros not afraid of Chriftianos, fus or Lancaster.
At the efto Chriftianos pefaba them, i did, that they dixefe Language fu, that we were of them nofotros mifmos, i havia we lost many times havia, i we were Of little strong, i value, i that they were the lords of this land, whom havia of obedefcer, i fervid.
But all efto the Indians had in mui little or nothingness of what they they said: VNOs before others, talked with eachother, saying that the Chriftianos lying, because nofotros Falia forth from the sun, i put them where faith: i that the Fanabe nofotros sick, i killed them orphans who eftaban: i that we came defnudos nofotros, i defcalços, they veftidos i, i in Horses, Lance i: i that we did not covetousness nofotros any crow, but every quanto gave us, then give Tornabe, we remained with nothing i, i the others had no other purpose, steal all quanto were fine, i never gave anything to anyone, i nueftras relatively efta all mastheads, the encarefcian i instead of the other; i afi refpondieron them into the language of the Chriftianos, i did it mifmo faber other, by vna Language, that among these havia, whom we understood, i call those who vfan Primahaitu propria (which is to say Vafcongados) the qual more than four hundred Leagues from which we came, we found vfada including haver order one for all those Lands.
Finally he could never wipe out the Indians believe, we were on the other Chriftianos, i with hard work, i importunity the fus à Bolvar hecimos CAFAS, i sent them that faith afegurafen, i afentafen fus Peoples fembrafen i, i labrafen Earth, which eftaba defpoblada eftàr Monte ia mui full, so the qual culprit is the best in eftas Indies quantas ai, i most fertile i abundofa of Maintenance, i fiembran three times in the year.
He has many fruit, i mui hermofos Rios, i mui good many waters.
Ai mueftras great, i Final Gold Mine, i Plata People mui it is well equipped: Firvida to Chriftianos (which fon friend) mui goodwill.
Mui difpueftos are much more than those in Mexico, i finally, is Earth lacks any crow, for fer mui good.
Defpedidos the Indians, they told us, they would do what we sent, i afentarian Peoples fus, fi the Chriftianos the dexaban; i afi I tell you, i mui asserted by some, that fi does not do so, because of the atmosphere Chriftianos.
Defpues that hovimos mailed to the Indians at peace, i regraciadoles work with nofotros havia pafado, the EMBI us Chriftianos (vnder caution) à vn Cebreros, Mayor, i with the other two.
And when they took us through the mountains, i defpoblados, and away from the converfacion of the Indians, because i Vief or entendiefemos what actually did: where parefce quanto deceive the penfamientos faith of men, that they were walking bufcar nofotros freedom Quando i penfabamos that we had, so fucediò the contrary, because they had agreed to go to give the Indians embiabamos, afegurados, i peace, i amphi as Penfed, did: Montes llevaronnos for those two days, so water, lost, i end road, all i Penfed perefcer of fed, i drowned her faith we Fiete Men, i have many friends, that Chriftianos brought config, could not hafta get another day at noon, where we found that night Water nofotros i i walk with them twenty-five leagues, little more, or less, i finally vn individuals go to the Peace People of Indian, i the Mayor that took us there I leave us, i stepped forward other three leagues Village VII, whose faith called Culiacan, where Melchior eftaba Diaz, Mayor Maior, i Captain of that Province.
Of how the Mayor Maior refcibiò us good night we arrived.
As Mayor of nueftra Maior was avifado falida, i come, then left that night, eftabamos nofotros where i came, i cry a lot with nofotros, giving praise to God Nueftro Lord vfado molested for so much mifericordia with nofotros, i speaks, i mui is good, i from the Governor Nuño de Guzman, i got on, we ofrefciò everything I had, i could i moftrò much fentimiento of bad reception, i treatment, which Alcaraz, i found the other havia; i had indeed that the faith was there fi, faith so that nofotros efcufara, i with Indian hico faith; i pafada that night, another day we left, i asked the Mayor Maior us much, we detuviefemos there, i would we do that in efto fervicio mui great God, I to V.
Mag because the Earth eftaba defpoblada, so labrarfe, i all deftruìda mui, i walked Indians efcondidos, i escaped through the mountains, so do want to come in fus afiento Peoples, i that embiafemos à the call, i will mandafemos, from God, and V.
Mag that viniefen, i poblafen on the plain, i labrafen Earth.
A efto nofotros parefciò we put in dificultofo mui Indeed, because none of the Indian traìmos nueftros, or the leaf we accompany, i understand eftas mastheads.
Finally venturing efto two Indians who brought the captives there, mifmos were of the earth, i havia eftos found faith with Chriftianos, when first come to them, i saw the people who accompanied us, i fupieron lot of them authority, i domain, all lands that brought havia, i had, i Wonderland that havia fact, i havia curing the sick, many mastheads i, i with Indian eftos People's rule others, who together fuefen, i llamafen the Indians, who eftaban by Ranges Mayor, i Petaan those of Rio, where they found the Chriftianos havia, i that dixefen them that viniefen à nofotros because they wanted to talk, i for fuefen feguros, i viniefen other, we gave vn nofotros Calabaçon of which he had in his hands (which was principal nueftra infignia, i mueftra high eftado) i with ETFE they were, i walked Fiete days over there, i the order they came, they brought i Configo three Lords of which eftaban Mayors for the Sierras, bringing fifteen men, they brought us accounts i, i Turquefas, i Plumas, i the Menfageros they told us that no havia found the natives of Rio where falido havia because the havia Chriftianos done it again flee to the mountains, i the Melchior Diaz said to the language, that part will hablafe nueftra those Indians, i dixefe them as came from God, that EFTA in Heaven, i walked to the World havia many years, All People saying that havia found that creiefen in God, and what firviefen because was Lord of all mastheads quantas havia in the world, i was the reward, i paid the good, i life imprisonment the wicked fire, i that when the good die, take them to Heaven, where no one died, or were hungry or cold, or fed, or any other necefidad, the maior fine glory, that faith could Penfed, i that he does not want to believe, nor obedefcer fus Commandments, threw them vnder the earth, in the company of Hell, i large fire qual havia the faith never finishing, fine fiempre tormented, that beyond the efto i, fi fer quifiefen Chriftianos them, i fervid God, the way they mandafemos, that Brothers Chriftianos Terni them, i would treat mui well, i would send nofotros, hiciefen they do not no anger, nor fus facafen of Lands, fine large fuefen Friends fuios: more than fi efto quifiefen not do, they would try mui Chriftianos wrong, i faith Efclavos lead to other lands.
A efto refpondieron to the language, they mui fairs Chriftianos good, i fervirian to God we worship i asked, i facrificaban, i à who asked for the Water for Maìçales fus, i la falud for them?
Refpondieron that VN Man that eftaba in Heaven.
Preguntamosles, as a faith called?
And they said, that Aguar, i who believed, havia raised the entire world, i the tops of it.
Tornamosles questions, as fabian efto?
And refpondieron that fus Parents, Grandparents faith what havia i said, it had many times efto news, i fabian, that water, i all good mastheads that the EMBI.
Nofotros diximos them which one they were saying, nofotros we called him God, and that it llamafen amphi them, it firviefen i, i adorafen as Mandab, i faith they would find it rather mui.
Refpondieron, mui had everything provided, afi i that they would do, i mandamosles that baxafen of Saws, i viniefen feguros, i alone, i poblafen whole earth, i hiciefen CAFAS fus, i that hiciefen including vna to God, and the entry pufiefen vna Cruz, as we had there, i that when there's Chriftianos viniefen, the faliefen à Cruces refcebir with hands, Arches end, i end Armas, i the fus à llevafen CAFAS, i will eat Dief of what they had, by efta i would do them so badly before fus fairs Friends; i them they said that it amphi nofotros would do what we sent as: i, Captain gave Mantas, i mui treated well, i afi faith they returned, carrying two, eftaban captivity, i havia Menfageros gone by.
It went Efto PREFERENCES of Efcrivano in which there had, i many Teftigos.
How do Iglefias hecimos in that Land.
Efpantados such a novelty, that the Indians i les they said, as eftaban afegurados ia, he ordered them not hiciefen wrong, i amphi defpidieron faith.
Lord God Nueftro mifericordia infinite fu want, which in the days of V.
Mageftad, i below of vueftro Power, i Lordship, eftas fer people to come to truly, i with total willingness fujetas the true Lord who created, i redeemed.
What we certainly qual afi atmosphere, i to V.
Mageftad has to be the one who has to put into effect (atmosphere not so hard to do) because two thousand leagues that traveled by land, i by the Sea in Boats, another ten Mefes i that falidos defpues of Captiva, so we walked the Earth stop, we found Sacrifices or Idolatry.
In EFTE VNA Mar travefamos time to another, i on the news that diligently reach out to understand the other COFTA vna, so width can haver two hundred leagues i reach out to understand, that the COFTA South Pearl ai, i much enriches, i everything better, richer i efta near it.
In the town of San Miguel eftuvimos hafta fortnight Month Maio, i stop the CAUF of both there was because there hafta City Compoftela, where the Governor Nuño de Guzman refidia, ai hundred leagues, i all defpobladas fon, enemies i: i ovieron nofotros go with People, in which were twenty horse, we hafta accompanied forty leagues from there i came out with nofotros Chriftianos feis, that brought five hundred Indians made Efclavos, i arrived in Compoftela, Governor refcibiò us mui well, what i had gave us veftir: qual so many days I could not bring, or We could sleep fine in the fuel: i pafados ten or twelve days, we left for Mexico, i by all the way we were well treated by the Chriftianos, i Falia many of us see for Roads, i gave thanks to God of underworld rid of so many dangers.
