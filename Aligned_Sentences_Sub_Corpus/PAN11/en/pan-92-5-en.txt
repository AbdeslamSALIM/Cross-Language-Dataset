It has been found near the interior villages San-Jose, Tumupaza of Isiamas and Cavinas, forests are populated Cacahual providing very abundant crops annually, that are ignored by non-indigenous be forced to transporting your product on their backs.
Suffice to put an end to this state of affairs, to abolish slavery of course the staff, and established in every parish, trade is private factories, offices will be given to the Indians, government has a fair value instead of kilos of cacao that they could collect.
In addition, families making certain needs that have not known, it is awaken among these Indians the desire to acquire the means to the satisfaction of those, striving by this means to not dispose of these products and of such immense value, which each year serve only for the gift of the animals of the forest.
Although the province Caupolican could give rise to the culture of coca, without by this and this, is by the way, never to compete with the provinces of the Yungas and Dolls; although it would be possible to promote the cultivation of rice, coffee, maize and snuff, and engage in the working of the gold mines that abound in the mountains, drawing from Speculators including not a few advantages, but also would be possible to use cotton, applying to the manufacturing industry to supply its inhabitants dress gender, I think These commercial and industrial classes should be of secondary order in the province.
For each of the various parts of a territory the maximum yield of their products so that trade has an interest there, especially prone, it is necessary to the detriment other business classes, without an end to an amplitude which can produce with less work fat more useful, especially when no nearby competition.
In the final analysis, say that encouraging exclusively in the province of Caupolican, by a culture part of the husk in the mountains, another of the cocoa in the plains, two single fruit which have a useful general interest to the Republic, by the extent they can receive in trade, it would have given the good and advancement of the other provinces on the high plains, giving more room for the release of its industry products particular, whether only manufacturing and agriculture.
In this way would also Caupolicanos a free field to engage with encouragement to the regular and orderly harvest of the husk, and to the abundant and active cocoa.
If possible final quartering products by province, leaving, for example, industry to the high plains of Bolivia, in the departments of La-Paz, Oruro and Potos√≠ the manufacture of wool and the breeding of sheep, to the provinces of Moxos babes and cotton fabrics, to the provinces of the Yungas and growing Dolls coca, to the temperate valleys of Sicasica of Apupaya, Cochabamba and Chuquisaca the wheat planting, promotion of silk worms and the planting of vines to Santa-Cruz de la Sierra, and to Chiquitos Moxos to raising all kinds of cattle and sugar cane cultivation sugar, and finally to the scale and Caupolican Cacahual is forcing, so to speak well, to their respective inhabitants to internal traffic, exportation or mutual trade, which would do spread everywhere, while the wealth of the fertile germs civilization.
