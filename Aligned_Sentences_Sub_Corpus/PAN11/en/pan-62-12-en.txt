He closed the paper a charade in verse, which, if remembered correctly, was the word hazelnut.
It was resolved to translate, for the newspaper, The Mysteries Paris, work in six volumes.
Needless to say Sarrió Lighthouse, despite living some years, never made it to the third volume.
Don Rufo was a notable translator.
If a defect was brought to an, was the original setting is too.
One day he ventured that "the countess had seized the button of his secretary." This statement raised as cloud of dust among the ignorant people that Don Rufo, just angry, left the translation the serial.
It was charged to a driver who had career years in Bayonne.
The success of the prime number, as expected, was wonderful.
Sinforoso article, the wise discourse of Don Jeronimo de la Fuente, the newsletters and to the verses of Parakeet, all was read and justly celebrated.
But what mainly attracted the attention of the serious people and caused a deep impression on them, was the article by Don Rosendo our purposes.
That journalistic language as lively and spirited, those noble thoughts, enthusiasm the interests of Sarrió, openness and modesty that it glowed, full of joy hearts and made them to sense an era of prosperity and bienandanza.
Iluminóse the facade of printing with fairy lights.
The beautiful and merry artisans Sarrió, caught, as usual, the occasion for the hairs to dance mazurkas Havana and on the hard stones of the street.
The worthy individuals with the language of metal paid tribute of admiration and enthusiasm to the drafters of Faro, were treated by them with wine Wheel and cigars.
The joy was overflowing with all breasts and hugging so overflowed strong and spontaneous.
Don Rosendo embraced Navarro, Alvaro Peña Rudesindo don, don Rufo to Sinforoso, and Don Pedro Miranda Folgueras the printer.
The musicians hugged yes, and each and every one to his peritísimo director Mr.
Out of print, and also commemorate this glorious day, he hugged the blonde Pablito Nieves, exploiting the darkness of a doorway, and several other young men, following his example, equally distributed embraces the joyful celebrations among Aboriginal girls.
The only thing that troubled for a moment that general contentment, was the singular sadness that Folgueras seized as he had a few liters of wine into the body.
The memory of Lancia his hometown, he suddenly offered to the spirit, leaving him in a state of distress difficult to explain.
At the moment the happy clamor and reached its maximum, called Rosendo aside and with tears in his eyes, he said that life outside their homeland adored was unbearable for him a bale.
Death, rather than lose sight of the humble home that housed her crib, and the streets so often walked their children's feet.
That week, if God wanted, had to leave and move Sarrió again with his gear Lancia.
Upon receiving this news Rosendo abruptly turned pale. - But, man of God, and the number next to the lighthouse? - Don Rosendo, you can dispense ...
A gentleman knows how to appreciate feelings of another gentleman ...
Guzmán el Bueno threw the knife over the wall to kill his son ...
If I were of the Foundling or had no affection for the shirt that I wear, do not tell me anything I needed.
Life I would you like a dog giving the wheel ...
The man lives, the man works, man is sometimes a bit of expansion ...
Entered the two tried to dissuade him with powerful reasons.
The most powerful of all was a new bottle of wine from Rueda.
After having introduced into the body, the patriotic feelings of Folgueras visibly weakened.
Thoughts of glory, immortality vague desires of agitated the mind of the illustrious founder El Faro de Sarrió at the time of going to bed.
After turning off the light, even continued disturbed, until a force of spinning their pieces or take shape.
Don Rosendo he thought with excitement at the possibility of his death the town, grateful perpetuate his memory placing a tombstone with his name in the town hall.
Tribute of gratitude from the Sarrió villa his enlightened son Don Rosendo Belinchón, tireless champion of their progress moral and material.
It was not easy to sleep surrounded by these brilliant images.
However, after he fell asleep with a smile on his lips.
An angel of the Lord progressive is rigged in such cases, beat its wings all night on his forehead, inspiring dreams happy.
The next morning was in the best state of mind in any man can be found after his efforts crowned by a flattering success.
Dressed himself humming pieces of zarzuela.
Chocolate made with the family, took a look at the national newspapers and foreign and uncut the usual bundle of sticks, threw himself into the street to make sure the actual effect that the first issue of Faro had occurred.
In the store you were Graells with joy, congratulated him on his article (which he modestly attributed did not want to) and talked at length the newspaper.
What most aroused the enthusiasm of the good commentators, was the consoling thought that Nieves had not yet arrived or come in a long time with this level of improvement.
And Don Rosendo, slightly warmed by the praise, promised undertake active campaigns for everything he demanded.
One asked us to speak Ravine Back Street, another asked that we put a bluff near his home, another to him some pills to highest bidder tirasen beverages, other than not sing calm time because this will disturb the sleep, etc..
Don Rosendo nodded, frowned, extended open hand in sign of protection.
Don Rosendo announced the next number was much more interesting, and left.
In a crowd of sailors who had congratulated him on the dock with rude enthusiasm and he hinted at the idea that the dock was very dirty and needed to be dredged.
It dragaría: if dragaría go!
Don Rosendo away seriously possessed of omnipotence.
And rolling in the distance see the big waves and choppy, wondered whether it would be opportune to contact an excitement by the press to moderated their impertinent agitation.
As you arrive and when to eat, gave the house back to meditating on the grave responsibility would incur before God and men if, holding in his hands this sovereign power, no employed in the prosperity and aggrandizement of his hometown.
Upon reaching the Rúa Nueva, found on the sidewalk with Gabino Maza.
The former officer greeted him bilious very finely, it asked his family, and was buried with kindness health of each members.
Then he talked about the weather, the possibility that he is alive Northeast Gale trucks suddenly closed, and no ships could leave America's Career; immediately complained of dust in the roads, which prevented him from walking, he learned the price of cod and the news he had of fishing in Newfoundland.
Don Rosendo expected, as was natural that he told the newspaper.
Nothing: Maza made no mention of it.
The talk was of a point to another without touching on anything that relates to the press.
Rosendo Finally, something shortened and teaching all the pasta of your teeth, he said: - Have not received your El Faro?
I think that yesterday I brought home, but I have not yet opened - said Mace affected indifference .-- Go, Don Rosendo, "you eat like me ?...- Well bye.
Don Rosendo was a moment rooted to the ground as if you take a cold shower.
The blood rushed to his face furiously, and went on his way, halting, toward home.
Because he was so unprepared, that contempt was a stab that came to the quick.
After stunning ceased, we undertook an inconceivable wrath against that ... (Not satisfied to call less than evil and miserable).
He came home in a deplorable state of agitation.
Although he sat at the table, making efforts to calm the stomach, suddenly embarrassed, would not admit the food.
From time to as his lips twitched with a smile and muttered a sarcastic villain! - What are you, Rosendo? - Finally dared to ask his wife, who was already restless. - Nothing, Paulina, that envy causes havoc in the world - only answered bitterly.
Once discharged this profound statement, was in a state of relative rest.
He lay a chair to think, and within half an hour left home again in the direction of the Club.
Upon entering the cafe's voice shouting Gabino Maza as always up there.
To see Maza, gesturing in the middle of a group, he stopped, put on his hat and was a sullen gesture sit on the couch.
Those who listened to him, Don Jaime Marin, Delaunay, Don Lorenzo and Don Feliciano Gomez, greeted him with some embarrassment and a shame, which confirmed his suspicion.
Concealed his best, and trying to put a happy face, began to talk about the news running.
The conversation took the direction of every day, confidence, reigned.
But the engineer Delaunay, as smart as malevolent character, took the talk of newspaper asking their founder with wry chuckle in broken Spanish that he used: - What odd jobs you prepare for the next issue, Don Rosendo? - I will see you when you go - he replied dryly, that he guessed the hidden mockery behind the question. - Here at Don Feliciano - continued the engineer with the same smile - you have an advocate arch. - If I defend is that someone attacked me - said Don Rosendo even more dryness.
The silence lasted a long time, until it broke Belinchón asking a question himself indifferent to Don Jaime, which the conversation again encouraged.
The ball was on the roof and soon to fall.
Maza was vehement desire to tell you don Rosendo the paper was "a mess." This was not less alive to tell it was Maza an envious.
And indeed, at the first opportunity that was presented, both caught by the hairs to communicate these glad tidings.
The dispute lasted more than two hours.
Maza sought Rosendo was suppressed because an older gentleman and he had fifteen thousand reais.
The founder of the Lighthouse, for reasons of prudence, he dared not let the language entirely.
However, after all, in better or worse terms, all said for the edification of the notables, were divided for and on behalf of the contestants.
One must admit that part of Maza got the least.
The Indians, indifferent as ever to these fights, peered occasionally at the door of the pool cue in hand, to hear the reasons the contestants, and illustrated.
For them, those discussions were very helpful.
The state of agitation and anger that came out of the Club Rosendo can not be weighed.
Such was For Socrates, Columbus, Galileo, Giordano Bruno, and possibly also that of our hero.
The first bite of envy caused him severe pain that must have felt these great benefactors of mankind.
His spirit faltered.
It was a moment nothing else, a passenger who served fainting to demonstrate better the admirable temper of his soul.
As the mob of deprived Sarrio wit, enlightenment and encouragement, slept soundly, worthy man rolled in his bed on a bed of thorns, without achieving the caresses of sleep.
The next morning he got up a little pale and haggard, but strong and determined to continue His work of regeneration, in spite of all moral and material obstacles arise in its path.
That night of insomnia, rather than waste away his spirit and peel of company, confirmed it gave him strength to carry to a successful auction.
Fire consumes and it sparks the straw to gold as unblemished.
Ocupóse thus brilliantly in drawing the plan of the second issue that would appear on Thursday next.
And as always happens, success will brought happy to help.
Many jobs that were offered for the second issue, but most were not step.
Lack of space obligóle also reject some who were.
But the publication of the fifth highest number came another that occurred in the village honda and dragged him feel strong eddies.
It happened that Alvaro Peña, firmly convinced as we know, that all the pains and imperfections that humans depend suffer only a preponderance of the clergy, to take the gun propúsose newspaper undertake an active campaign against him.
And to start launched the guise of guerrillas, some few newsletters.
