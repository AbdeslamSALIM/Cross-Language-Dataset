The human characters in this drama are masterfully plotted and developed; they seem even more real than reality itself.
Famulus Marta and Wagner are two comedic characters which can serve as models.
Margaret and her brother both wax poetic; however, their social status is too humble for them to have been so culturally well-rounded, as culture would not have been so widespread in the time period of the piece.
But the simplicity and purity of both is more distinct and persistent despite this.
Fausto is a far more complicated creature.
