And still, there is little to observe.
However, I am not able to recognize the men who have contributed to the progress and moral improvement of our progeny in society and as the individual, not to have written novels, nor scarcely have they written anything.
I do not know that Sakiamuni has written anything, nor Socrates, nor Jesus Christ, if it is fair to cite them as mere men.
As such, with much talk and much to write it follows that little or nothing is done outside the delight of the reader or of that heard when it is said it is a good job.
And to the contrary, it usually contributes more to our linage, than the written letter that is profusely understood or destroyed or erased.
For example, Valga, who relates that Confucius was great to millions and millions in Chine, extracted some and formed a book on the wisdom of the celestial empire.
The final lesson of all.
We, therefore, are not wise, we write profusely what we want, but we should not imagine that we teach, nor that we improve humanity, or that we open new and hidded paths.
Suffice it to say, we aspire to entertain or to agreeably move, not to all of humanity, solely to a few thousand individuals, who form our public and have good or bad taste in the stories we write.
God willing, this good or bad taste is not lost and our audience does not dissapate, but that it persists or is renewed, and that for better or for worse the novels and stories we write hold up half as well as Amadis of Gaul that was read by Diana de Jorge de Montemayor, which almost no one reads now, because they lack the patience.
And, also that there is no lack for the lectures of El Liberal, to note that throughout this literary discussion, I put the final point on my part of this and promise not to say anything, even if other writers contradict me and elucidate on the matter with better skill and grace.
