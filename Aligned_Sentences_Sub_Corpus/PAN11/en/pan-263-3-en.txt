XIX Dear Pepe: Imagine how upset I'll be: four days since we've seen, and rabies to quarrel with you.
Silly, silly me, did you think you know I had not find your sorrows to share?
The guy you have said, surely the questions you did and how I answered.
I am convinced that all told you.
I, however, will not forgive you your lack of candor.
They do not deserve forgiveness for ignoring I've hidden my love of the obstacles that will cause your brother.
