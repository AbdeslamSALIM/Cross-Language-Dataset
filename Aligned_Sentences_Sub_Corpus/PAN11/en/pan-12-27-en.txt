Commissioned to will prompt you to speak one last time and settled or not to give part of what was happening.
No wanted to come, no doubt fearing my wrath.
Fell with another attack, and was certainly loves to look for him, because when I opened my eyes he was beside me.
Asked the housekeeper to make me a cup Linden ...
As we were alone, without a word fell upon me, enveloping me face with kisses, squeezing so hard that I die ...
Stunned and horrified, jumped some shouting, but he stifled putting his hand over her mouth ...
I struggled with despair, And God gave me strength to let go of his arms and jump out of bed ...
But there was little set foot on the floor, I met again with the subject and gagged ...
There was a rumor long.
It was difficult to happen otherwise.
Obdulia had shown, under the lash of anger, diabolical talent.
His words and gestures, a little exaggerated, vibrated with indignation.
His eyes never ever crossed that of the priest, but he knew well to give the appearance of this fear contempt. - I wish to express the complainant - the defense attorney asked - how is that, having everything happened just said, he confessed only after the author of that flight and nothing said to much time elapsed violence he endured. - I did not say anything to disgrace.
Only when I saw my honor on the floor, only when reached my ears that was said in Peñascosa, I ventured to confess to my father.
Mandated of that I am here, that otherwise would not have been.
To all questions put to him, both the president and the lawyers, responded with admirable composure and resiliency.
Not a moment lacked imagination.
Gil proposed to end the confrontation with Ms Josefa.
He went back and fixed it an angry look on Obdulia, which paid him another hit with contempt.
A few words it showed signs of agitation and was horribly pale. - False, false! - Shouted for joy. - Is it true that you came into the room of my master, saying: "Father, here I am you!" and my master, unanswered word, he rose from his chair, grabbed you by the arm and set of legs out of the cabinet? - Lies ...
To save his master invented a calumny. - I'm not crazy, no, nor slander anyone ...
The slander that you are a priest, rogue, you have to give account to God for their evil ... - Please report the witness - said the president also .-- please report the complainant, or I'll be forced to expel them from the room.
But neither ignored the threat.
A saint! - Silence! - Shouted the president hitting the bell. - Give you a good holy God - the girl exclaimed .-- sarcastic smile you do not slander the other for saving him. - Enough!
But Ms Josefa, until he reached her, kept shouting: - There is no justice to this poor woman caning, the feather! ...
Rascal, you've gone always behind the priests, like a bitch out! ...
Keep it in a bath of cold water that is cool! ...
His speech was, as expected, eloquent and furious.
Her voice was veiled because of bronchitis chronic: when he wanted to raise was shrill, strident.
The word was fluid, although abounded in public areas of journalism.
In Lancia nobody knew about this smoothness.
These passions are common the clergy, in which a regime of idleness and a sedentary life and the exciting spring ...
As insist too much on this, the president called him to order.
He described the crime with a picturesque crudeness purpose to impress the court.
A odious plan laid out beforehand and carried out with firmness and skill relentless.
Abuse of trust first, then indecent assault, and finally, a coward and sacrilegious violation.
The evidence was inconclusive.
With force and subtlety at the same time he was collecting all on the head of the priest to conclude with this paragraph: - And if all these data were not damning enough to prove premeditation plainly crime, I will argue next.
It is said, and all agree in this, that the father had Gil confession to her daughter to a convent of Carmelite Astudillo.
in Astudillo Carmelite convent there.
The speech was short and decisive.
At the end he felt a murmur approvingly, a bad omen for processing.
The defender he was a lawyer of experience and intelligent, but lacking in all the oratorical skills of his opponent.
Word was abundant, but it was dull, heavy, more calculated to elucidate some obscure point in a civil case to drag the spirit of the court and the public.
Be entertained with great thoroughness to reconstitute the informalities seeking summary, calling the court's attention on details, some of them insignificant.
Nothing to enter, as it should, in the character of the complainant, to highlight the chronic disorder of the nervous system, its surprising violence feelings, like love to hatred, susceptibility unhealthy self-esteem seemed devoid of skin and flesh forever, nothing to seek, in short, the origin, the true origin of that strange charge.
He spoke about an hour and a half.
Briefly the private prosecutor corrected some errors of fact.
Sostúvolos the defense, as their condition was long and neatly.
So that the nuisance generated on his maiden speech multiplied significantly in the second.
Fr Gil got up from his bench and cast a look as smooth as roams the room.
Seemed he awoke from a dream.
Silence reigned in the auditorium deep and anxious.
Despite the unfavorable atmosphere that had formed around him, her delicate figure, poetic, which shone humility, could not fail to impress favorable. - I am innocent of the crime that I committed.
In the hands of God, in whom I have long ceased all my thoughts and attention, now let my sentence.
For a moment he glimpsed the truth as in the light of lightning.
But the darkness fell back into the room and thickened in the most perspicuous intelligences.
No missing who mutter that priests, by evil they were, were always on the lips these words.
The president responded with his usual pungency: - Well, God will judge him later.
XV The court sentenced the men to fourteen years, eight months and one day in prison.
Officer of the hearing room that was to read the sentence to jail is believed the duty of lavish comforts.
The case was not hopeless.
If this does not happen, he was still young and would probably presidial especially considering cuts as the government grants from time to time, etc., etc. - Thank you, thank you, sir - said the priest, whose countenance expressed a deep calm, an inner serenity that drew attention .-- You think me very unhappy, right? - Much ...
You inspire me with great compassion - responded with rueful face the notary. - "So you do not change for me now?
The employee made a grimace of terror. - Unfortunately ...
Could well give you your freedom, your honor, your position and your family be like me ...
and you would still huge profits.
The notary looked at him in amazement.
His eyes went after a flash of concern, fearing found in front of a madman, and hastened to say goodbye and leave.
An iron cot, a pine coffee table, comfortable chairs and some rough straw made up all the furniture.
Fr Gil, after remaining motionless for a moment in attitude reflection, was to be placed under those rays.
Her blonde head suddenly illuminated, glowed gold, white complexion took on a singular transparency.
Her slim body, thin, dressed in black cassock, seemed a column of ebony to underwrite this head.
He left to drown by the warm wave, slowly drinking his sweet, pulsing under his touch as a captive bird.
But she laughed merrily the sky soul, intoxicating joy flooded.
In the depths of his being too bright blue infinity.
Since the Gracia had visited lived in perpetual feast.
His eyes suddenly lit, contemplated the universe in its ideal nature.
All leaflets lying on the ratio had fallen to the ground: the great secret of existence is revealed to him directly with admirable clarity and purity.
Behind this apparent life around us was real life, infinite life, and entered it with hearts full of joy.
In this life everything is infinite love, or what is equal all is bliss.
Enter it is to put your foot in the Empire of Eternity.
Is life spirit.
The world can not change or destroy time, because she is the principle same time and the world.
God loved life, lived beyond the time at source same ideal and lasting imaginative world that surrounds us.
Their days are no longer sliding sad and anxious as a portion of time.
And not suffer the gnawing desire, not exhaled plaintive complaints about their sins, their resolutions due, because he loved and his own works, however good they were, as before, but only the Eternal.
Because works have their origin in the person, and he was stripped of his, had refused firmly.
In the midst of a holy and sweet indifference let God should work within their spirit.
Forever free of doubt and uncertainty, I knew I should not want more than one thing, and everything else would be given in addition.
He was sure that the power divine love that had sprung up in him should not ever be exhausted, and that this love would guide him forever.
The fear of death and destruction not disturbed.
Death, since he had entered in the life of eternity, was to him incomprehensible.
No need to go down to the grave get this eternal life.
Bastabales join heart to God to possess and enjoy it.
Learned, finally, once and for all, that man can not escape the pain and death by reason but by faith, that is, by a different and better knowledge than it can give us.
Since this knowledge enlightened spirit, happiness reached absolute.
Without concern for the future, without feeling for the past, do not feel like anything not rejecting anything either, his life long he glided like a happy dream, as a sweet intoxication.
He dropped the lead of desires and sorrows that bound him to the ground.
Freed from all illusion and every effort, without fear of annihilation or hope selfish resurrection, by virtue of Faith and love play in his soul knew the true reign of God.
Representársele soon that it was a delight to the senses, and making a gesture of disdain, was to sit in the darkest corner of the room.
Only by renouncing the pleasures, only looking for the suffering and lording his senses had reached that state of bliss of sublime indifference. - Why do I need that sun rays - it was said - if the fire that burns within my soul I warms and comforts me best?
Living in the life of the senses is to be a slave of time and necessity.
No longer a slave tremble.
I have the consciousness of my freedom.
No need to die to get it back.
This feeling of my freedom fills me with joy, I am an emancipated soul printed on the label of my God.
Nothing happens, nothing of what may happen to disturb the peace of my heart.
The pulse beat of my inner life with the same force until it beeps when I leave this world.
I've eaten meat and I drank the blood of the Redeemer, and according to his promise, I live in Him and He dwells in me.
I Am a Child of Eternity.
I picked up the legacy of my Father, and no one, nobody can me boot! ...
The lock on the door rang loudly.
Appeared in the key, a fat man with the face red, eyes full of meat, the suit dirty and greasy, bulky and around the abdomen a wide leather belt trimmed with keys.
Not to say good morning or make a minimum a courtesy, turned toward the hall, saying: - Come, gentlemen, you pass.
Behind him came two gentlemen in frock coat and top hat.
The one tall, blond, with a long beard that reached his mid-chest, open and friendly face, young yet.
The other lower and thin, sickly color, thin beard and glasses.
The first was a distinguished physician of the population.
The second, a lawyer very fond of studies criminal and had already published several papers relating to them.
They greeted him politely, but without shaking hands. - Well, there I leave you with the pater - said rudely keychain you .-- Tell when they want out.
The lawyer took a step toward the prisoner, and said with an amiable smile: - We would like, if you do not mind it, ask some questions ... - You're very own - said the priest, fixing his clear eyes that achieved a disturb him.
There is more charity in prison than ordinarily say.
Entablose an animated conversation.
Sought, as the doctor that the lawyer, it increasingly intimate and family, learning with interest the details of their daily lives.
Enteráronse also some particularities concerning their family.
The suicide of their mother called on all the attention, and long entertained time to ask what he knew about who had given him being.
Finally, after one-hour conversation, during which he looked with stubborn insistence of those who going to buy an animal, the doctor asked: - Do we allow you now to take some information about his skull and other measures? ...
Fr Gil, a little surprised, agreed immediately.
The doctor removed from his back pocket of his coat a Craniometric and ribbon.
Skull took it as round, then the bone box that protects the brain, the facial angle, the length of the face, measured facial projection and the wall, the zygomatic arches and mandible ...
Fr Gil was on the cross, while a sweet and melancholy eyes folded his lips.
Measured the long arms.
After the hand.
At this point, became a doctor and lawyer change another look of intelligence.
Finally, after they had heard what they wanted, took leave of him very politely, often giving thanks for his kindness and trying to encourage good reasons.
The next day appeared in The Future of Lancia, signed by the criminal lawyer, a article with the title of a visit to P.
Did in the exact relationship of the interview, describing in detail the person of the priest prisoner, and ended with a series of deep scientific considerations on the characters anatomical, pathological and physiological that the offender had. "Among the anthropometric data - said in one paragraph - common to all criminal we have seen only a slight predominance of the parietal projection compared to the front and enough development of the zygomatic arches and mandible.
In contrast, P.
Gil gives her figure absolutely all the features that positive criminal school assigned as peculiar to the rapist and libertine, is as follows: the outer ear way outbound and insert a loop, bright eyes, the delicate appearance (except of the jaw), straight hair, skin morbid hands very long and somewhat effeminate in the set.
