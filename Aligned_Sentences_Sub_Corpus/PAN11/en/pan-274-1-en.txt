With this decision I have tackled, if not all, much of the injustice they were doing, and I have a regular shape the economic governance of the peoples and the harmony that should be between the mayor, council and manager of each establishment.
I tried all my attempted to encourage agriculture and industry, encouraging them to my exhortations and advice, and for which applied more effort, increased the ration of meat to them was a third more, and so I managed not to be applied rigorously to work, and seeing Pay all debts, and increased cattle on farms, which at present have about 80,000 head more than you had my income, and proportion is to increase the boyadas, mares, foals, horses, mules and sheep, not being less known advantage in chacarería.
Have increased the cotton, planted reeds repaired yerbales and improved in all branches of agriculture have also sought new homes are built among all peoples, and that the consequences of which had, as well as churches and main houses.
Although this has not advanced as much as I wanted, because the lack of construction workers as prevented, it has been so little has been done is not known quite unlike now as they were before.
But, to have achieved these advancements, I have had to be go at least every two months, all peoples, see their mills and chacarería, improve what was not as needed, to establish what it considered useful to encourage the Indians and not forgive diligence and fatigue as deemed appropriate to the achievement of overtaking.
Up the same rooms I visited, however to be very separate peoples (some far more than 40 leagues) I recognized all its land, people, places, rodeos, pens, status of their livestock, tools of the workmen and, finally, the knowledge can lead to Practical them remedied many abuses and other faults I found, leaving established with advice from two foremen and experience working as thought it might be useful to increase and good cattle, and success has been matched according to my wishes.
Seeing that one of the main causes that mattered to the gloom in which they lived these was natural indecency and filth with which they treated in their homes, ensure that both magistrates decent rooms were available to them, giving them to understand what I would like to find them them and their women with decency whenever I visited them that would be often.
After Every year I set aseasen and repair their homes inside and out all of cabildo, and so people are being improved and used to live with decency.
For the toilet of their home accounts for its people, how they tried to persuade I would be pleased to see that instead of tipoy, they used their women wear shirts, skirts or petticoats, even if they are cotton canvas, and bodices or adjusters who girt his body and hide their breasts, and that they performed more grooming would be treated for me, and would do were all more distinction.
At this point there was something to overcome, because the Indians concerned with equality that had grown up, did not allow any stood out from the others, but at last they have been desimpresionado this error, and toilet are introduced with no overtaking small.
As things that try to not get the desired success if command or persuade them not accompanied by the practice of some events in which the experience aware of the favorable effects and conveniences offered to him, so of course knew these natives what they had to follow the toilet, I ordered that houses the main in the magistrate, or those of other Indian leaders, they are not prevented the coupling to have their home entertainment when there is a reasonable reason and decency and order regular, which I attended quite a few times with my wife and I always attend such managers and their wives, so I managed to banish the hateful separation had between Spanish and Indians, establishing treatment and mutual communication, not only as on these occasions, but also in every day of the year that we visit with each other Spanish men and all the families in whom shines the toilet, and this is a powerful incentive to encourage more and more each day, as is experiencing.
