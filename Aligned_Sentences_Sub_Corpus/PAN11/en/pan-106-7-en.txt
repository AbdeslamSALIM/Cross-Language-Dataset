I told you I loved how Magdalene with stunning, with complete unconsciousness no basis for any real hope.
The idea of ??marriage, besides a hundred times absurd, even the innocent breath had lent momentum to an affection that was enough himself to be, was to spread and formed a cult with no other motive than to worship.
What were the feelings of Magdalene?
I was sure that Madeleine could not feel any interest in a perhaps surprising that had thrown in his way as a mere accident.
It was possible that the single life longing did not see no fear approaching the moment of taking a game so seriously.
But certainly - yet admitting that he was free from any serious affection, - the will of his father, considerations rank, social position and fortune, would decide to accept an alliance to which the Lord of Nièvre contributed, plus lots of convenience, high quality otherwise.
He felt no resentment, no anger or jealousy of the man who made me so unhappy.
Before to embody the rule of law represented, and that of reason.
So the day the Magdalena's father introduced us to each other at my aunt telling her that I was the best friend of his daughter, remember to shake the hand of the Lord of Nièvre honestly thought: "Well But if she loves you, he loves you too! "
