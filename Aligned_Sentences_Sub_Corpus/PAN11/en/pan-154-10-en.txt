A silver chueta withheld a long time.
But the heir Febrer, the offspring of wealthy merchants and heroic sailors, had to withdraw thinking about the money he kept in his belt.
Was certainly not enough for such a purchase.
Then in another store Pepet purchased a knife, the bigger and heavier than found, an absurd weapon, capable of making him forget that of his glorious grandfather.
At noon, Febrer, bored aimless walks by the Navy and the steep streets of the former Royal Force, entered a small inn, the only one of the city, located along port.
He found the guests as usual.
In the lobby, a few young men dressed of peasants, with headquarters cap: soldiers of the garrison that served as assistants.
In the dining room, junior officers of a battalion, young lieutenants who smoked with a bored and looked through the windows, as prisoners of the sea, the vast blue expanse.
