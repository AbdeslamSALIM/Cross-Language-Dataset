We must choose between death and life: the renunciation of life is preferable but you do not wish, and as I have to live, exterminate the whole human race to procure what you think it's more futile the satisfaction!
But are not you glad now to be free, is not it good to be in skills to be able to leave me if, having seen the way I am, do you feel inspired horror?
