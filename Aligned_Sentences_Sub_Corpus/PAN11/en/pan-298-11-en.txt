The marriage had embellished giving the full kind of the female form, making her beautiful golden spring and wonderful summer.
The same maternity, without removing or defacing cool your body, it lent a soft, protective majesty.
Then the sovereign pleasure, art, or rather, with I knew adapt the color and shape of the dress to the tone of her flesh and changes operating in nature, gave prominence to this exquisite and lovable.
Of course, the whole house revolved around her.
As a goddess worshiped and feared, his spirit moved all human figures sheltering towers puppets.
To Dona Paula, who had actually face in the first months of marriage, had slipped back into slavery.
She did not abuse that domain.
Let all your taste fulfilled, except when directly or indirectly going against him.
For example, no one knew when to Sarrió would make, but it.
The no cook food arranged without consulting her.
The driver went up to ask every day if I wanted to walk.
The gardener did not move a pot without asking the permission.
In contrast no he cared little or much that her husband come out.
Once saw him ready to leave Cecilia, he said, smiling in the presence of these and others: - Great friends you are going by you and Cecilia.
Look, I celarme.
And the time to say, fell upon him one of those looks that expressed belief sovereign depths of his domain.
Gonzalo, even moving away, I could not break the chain again soft and submissive to his feet, like the comet that crosses giddy spaces and to an immeasurable distance from the sun feel the brake and he becomes docile to his forehead.
Gonzalo paid that look to other absolute return.
Cecilia had been slightly pale and smiling to hide his embarrassment. - Come on, gone, gone!
Do not want to see ahead - added .-- If you are hitting me, too bad you, it'll take a revenge sounded.
The joke was not delicate, bearing in mind what had mediated between Cecilia and Gonzalez.
But Venturita woman was not repaired much to unlock.
In early December moved to Sarrió.
A month after giving birth Ventura a beautiful girl, white and blonde like her.
Gonzalo was so in love with his wife, who received with joy, yes, but not with the joy and eagerness with which men usually welcome their first child.
His concern was primarily the health of his wife, who does not supervene incident.
Everything became enter and leave the room, taking the pulse and grind to questions Don Rufo.
In view of this, Ventura could raise no objection to his daughter.
She was a girl sturdy, well made.
Only when children do very greedy, freshness and beauty the mother usually fade a little.
In this event, she was filled with fear and opposed, first disguised, then in no uncertain terms, to breastfeed the child.
Gonzalo was convinced then and even found that a reasonable objection.
Instead Dona Paula was greatly angered, but only expressed his displeasure at the back of Ventura.
Cecilia was so caring, so vigilant in the care of the creature, which soon fully seized of it.
Placed in his room a bed for the mother and the cradle girls, with the pretext that it was ill Venturita he passed a bad night.
She withstood two and three sailing without any alteration.
And indeed, as the girl cried, was the first that jumped out of bed to give to the nurse.
If it could not silence it Tomabal in arms, and walked with her for hours, to sleep.
With this, the young couple were able to sleep together again with the same freedom and neglect in the early days of dating.
When morning had the baby to his mother, Cecilia and had bathed in warm water and brought it wrapped in clean diapers.
When it came time to enter the toilet gave it back to her sister.
Similarly, though with some diffidence, born from the desire not to offend your sister and be contrast to her, Cecilia was involved in the care of clothing Gonzalo, and in accordance his office.
And she was neglected Asaz renew their dresses, like her brother extremely wears the latest fashion, no consented under any circumstances, that he wandered one day even with a boot or tie chopped dirty.
Enjoyed to see him go out with a sleek new suit.
From the balcony, raising a little shade, followed him with her eyes when she went to coffee with a cigarette in his mouth.
And then that he turned the corner, still watching, until it dissipates in the air, last puff of smoke was released.
One day, Gonzalo, angry with himself for what he spent without substance, gave the key money .-- "Look, you keep that key, or Ventura or art I have to manage the rooms.
When you ask for money, as outlined in this notebook and you let us know what we spent in the month.
Maybe this way we will moderate a bit. "Turned into quartermaster general, the couple soon realized some improvement in their business.
This intimacy, this unique rapport in-laws in almost all acts of life, had fathered an unlimited trust between them, mostly by Gonzalo.
His wife, but neither cared nor wanted to hear even talk about the chase, of their disputes, the occurrences of his friends.
Everything that was not fashion, dance, Descriptions of Madrid soirées, weddings of the largest in Spain, slightly interested.
What most excited his curiosity was as it related to the kings and the royal family.
Avidly read the story palace receptions, knew the label as well as a gentleman of the bedchamber, how to greet kings, how he kissed their hands, when he had to speak in his presence, how he had to retire.
He knew the names and biographies of each of the members of the royal family and also the most distinguished nobles of the court.
The majesty of princes touched her, the foreclosure of submission, that she was unable to humiliate anyone!
And that gallant life of the court gave him a glare and the glow of a happy dream.
When I had been in Madrid, the quality of provincial America, had not consented to enjoy rather than theaters, car rides down the Castellana, shops and streets.
Of the court, their soirees and rejoicing, had remained as distant as Sarrió.
And But she was well convinced, and he was right, that could shine in any part.
Her beauty and alive and funny imagination was endowed, had made it noted immediately in the highest society.
Sometimes walking in with her landau husband, had been carefully noticing her eyes and lust of the Duke of S. ..
of Marquis de C. ..
of towering political figures.
Once he had heard the Duchess of Medina as they cross the carriages, tell your partner will be married this girl :--«¿ as cute? "In those three months in Madrid, had been a poetic vision, a memory confusion of their pleasures, and some itching to imitate with the poor means at its disposal in the town to swanky ladies of the court, whose customs he only knew by hearsay ..
Thus, For example, he left home, which was infrequently used to do in a carriage, especially if he went to theater.
The custom of the car came to wait for the conclusion of the function Sarrió had caused some surprise and no little grumbling.
Costumes with that presented public were always fanciful, entirely different from the other ladies wearing of the population.
Ventura operated a revolution, seen from the morning with new clothes and appropriate at that hour.
Not surprised her again, or even withdrawal of his cabinet, without all the gadgets and ornaments typical of the time.
Their gowns colored silk always off, their lace bonnets never seen before, her slippers velvet, was the astonishment of the population.
There were many ladies who were to visit only touched by news of his home.
Gonzalo, seeing her engrossed in reading the journals of rooms, hearing described as if I had seen, a dance palace, cried laughing :--«¿ you know the name of medicine that hobby of yours? ...
Like all characters mocking, deeply wounded him ridicule.
With his sister the young man laughed a few times, others showed irritation of those extravagances of his wife, which he described as stupid and cheesy.
Never let's get out of his mouth some useful advice, some comforting words to calm down its strong and sudden anger.
It had been so accustomed to those confidences when after a scuffle with Ventura was not his sister at home, put the hat and ran to look for walks, to church or where it was.
The long spent together these reliefs also uninvited.
Ventura did not want to leave.
And Don Rufo demanded that the girl take the outdoors, Cecilia was responsible for accompanying the mother.
Gonzalo accompanied them to both the mother with the girl before, he and Cecilia back.
In those long walks he confided all his secrets, he neatly explained their fears, their joys, their hopes.
Sometimes, listening to reason with as much insight into moral matters, I used to cry with little gallantry :--«¡ Ventura Too bad your character has no sensible and sensible! " She, however, remained impenetrable to him, as for all the world.
Or because he did not secrets to tell, or too quiet temperament, the eldest of Belinchón fleeing to talk about herself with extraordinary care.
Neither their joys and their sorrows were unrecognizable.
Only a very fine observer could, by force of habit, out vaguely stirred the emotions.
Gonzalo was not.
In his childhood self healthy and muscular man, had come to see her sister as a passive, reasonable and cool, admirable advise and lead others, a higher being, if you will, but unable to feel those anger, those joys, those foolish passions that altered the weak characters like yours.
However, sometimes, in jest, had tried to get the body their little secrets.
I knew that three or four young men of the people aspiring to her hand.
To some of them had caught more than once walking the streets.
And although he noted with some disgust Gonzalo that he must have in that worship more desire for the dowry that true love speaking it sought to flatter their suitors.
She shrank from the conversation with stubborn silence, smiling vaguely so as not to betray his thought, until after it looked precisely to talk about something else.
On one occasion, however, Gonzalo took the matter more seriously and persistently.
A childhood friend, engineer, spoke to Cecilia, and asked for his protection interested in their favor.
The frankness and sincerity of his speech was very pleased the boy. - Gonzalo - he said - I'm already old and ready to get married.
I did not want to do in Madrid or Seville, where I intended, because I distrust women who do not know far back.
Men should marry at home with young people who have seen it grow to his side.
Determined to marry a girl of the population, I've noticed your sister, and I honestly tell you my thoughts.
Cecilia is not pretty or ugly, is a woman passable.
I always believe that they are more calculated to wives.
In the four or five times I've spoken to her home of Saldana, I found it very nice and very reasonable, honest and modest.
Her friends all speak well of her.
It is an important fact that men do not take into account enough to marry.
Besides, your sister have a good luck tomorrow, and this, why should not I tell you?
also other data that should be considered.
I do not know why they have to marry men for system with poor women.
The man needs created by marriage, are many: children may become too high, and everything should look.
Gonzalo promised to bring their influence, he hinted more or less reluctantly clear, flattering success, boasting of the power exercised over it.
Until then all indications that did, had been addressed .-- "I think if I do not get carried to auction the company, no one else can try it "- he concluded by saying in a fit expansion and pride.
That night seized the moment when Cecilia came to inflame the lamp at the office, to say it smiling: - Do you have something to do now, Cecilia? ...
The girl looked at him with big blue eyes and soft, where he painted the surprise.
Gonzalo forced her to sit. - Do you have a boyfriend? - The asked sharply. - What a question - she said smiling face, without shame. - Do not talk about boyfriend.
I just want to know if between youth award new one is interested to have achieved more or less. - What do you want to know that? - Answer.
Cecilia shook his head. - Well then I take the liberty to speak of one, who has begged me ...
It This is my friend Paco Flores, whom I know.
I have been asked to recommend to you, asking while if the few times you have spoken you had been unfriendly. - Nasty? - Asked with surprise .-- Why?
If you Paco is not unpleasant, as you confess, you can not ensure that after six or eight months or a year does not fall in love with him. - I am incapable of falling in love - with a bitter smile she said that her brother did not understand. - Love comes when least expected - he said .-- We sententiously years and years without feeling, and one day, poof!
These words as candid as cruel, removed the few drops of gall Cecilia kept in his chest.
With quick sentence and looking hard at one of the arms of the chair where was sitting, said: - Well, I'm sure my heart will not poof!
any day. - Why should ensure that, Cecilia?
Women more than men, are made for love for the enjoyment it provides, for family life.
You could say that the only destination of women on earth is marriage, because it is responsible to hold onto it life.
Its physical layout, all body organs are built for the production of this life ...
Gonzalo advocated by his friend Paco, appealing, as it looks, even physiology.
Cecilia listened in silence, his face stern, staring into space.
The words of his brother rang in his soul as an accent of despair.
Yes, it was true, unfortunately was all true!
When finished making the apology of love, was his friend Paco Flores a young man so clear, so formal, the son of a good family, brilliant career, etc., etc.
Cecilia dryly persisted in refusing his consent to come home.
Then Gonzalo, a little irritated by the dispute, and wounded his pride for having boasted no Paco right in front of its influence on the young, let out some harsh words: "Why seemed little chance for her?
