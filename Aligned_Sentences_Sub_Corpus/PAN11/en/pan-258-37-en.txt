His work active, their spirit and determination were undoubtedly the levees that held back the speed that ran the progress of the revolt, and those who put down the voracious flames had begun to burn with too much violence, stirred by the sweet enticing offerings that promised freedom to the edicts of Tupac-Amaru, scattered by the commissioners in all parties, which did not fail to penetrate to the hearts of the inhabitants of the province of Tucuman, whose natives were beginning to be available to support the troubles gladly Tungasuca raised in Chayanta and having no qualms about publicly expressing what a pleasure they would be the domain of an owner who claimed freedom from oppression that were considered.
On March 18 received the first specifications of the commander D.
Ignacio Flores, which communicated the happy success which he had Punilia the attack, news of which had acquired Reseguin few hours earlier by some voices vague, but before long the exhilaration of such disturbed important to notice, because the same evening he learned from D.

Representing a lot of authority, adorned with the insignia corresponding the supposed character, speaking with integrity, have manifested the spirit and resolution, with some ability to perform the command obtained, and premeditated attack Tupiza to free the criminals who were imprisoned in their jails.
He added, that three Indian brothers, names, one of Tupac-Amaru, and the two remaining Damaso and Nicolas Catari, had entered some villages, ensuring personages were pretending, and that the natives without further examination, and obeyed blindly following them, with who had assembled a considerable body, able to overcome the efforts of the few neighbors fair, which had been held by the King until then in some populations, those which abandoned hastily, afraid of death and forced the terror instilled by those tyrants everywhere, with killings, robberies and outrageous excesses.

This unexpected accident scared the others who accompanied Condori, and dazed undertook a hasty flight, to join with more distant, between those who took the disorder, and inserted between all the confusion, which usually causes the diversity of views, but did not think that the leak leaving in the hands of his revered our general, who have been properly secured, continued to Great Chocalla in search of three brothers who had the same fate, and sixth day departure, returned to Tupiza with all these prisoners, full of glorious satisfaction and not a little pleased with some Spanish, because they saw recovered much of the wealth they had usurped.
