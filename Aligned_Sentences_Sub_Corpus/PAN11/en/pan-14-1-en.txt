Would it not have better suited your purpose, if Ignacio had fallen passionately in love with Miss Eulalia before marriage?
This would better explain that while it is improbable, bordering on impossible something happens to Ignacio that is similar to what happens to the tenor, Fernando in the beautiful opera, La Favorita.
Ignacio, to a lesser extent feeble minded, a sleepwalker and absent minded, but in a sense, without finding out what had happened, he is just as jealous of his honor in the aforementioned marriage to Eulalia.
In light of what is happening and what you are saying, not just a few people of the high society to which you belong, accuse you of deep pessimism, coated in dark immorality and vices.
For which I see in the distance as your bad intentions.
And, neither do I understand what is to be the bad result, while the intention is to be good.
