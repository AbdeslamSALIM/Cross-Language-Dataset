They presided or attended when heretics were tortured or burned alive, and all his conception of morality was aimed to such methods.
The resident could not leave 12 miles of their residence without the risk of death, says Seignobos, as in the continent property of the clergy and the nobility were tax exempt, at the end of time modern European society was most iniquitous exploitation of the commons for classes privileged.
According to the English traveler Young, the outbreak of the Great Revolution, the servant was in the status of farm animal, working from sunrise to sunset for the idle, and feeding roots in bad times.
Especially the church, absorbing and constantly hogging positive real produce imaginary goods, the exploitation of the miracle and the sacraments on souls frightened by it, cutting the intelligence to the passivity of the absurd mandatory that "the hand of the clergy in the language and the art of writing had become media kill common sense ", says Robertson, emaciated to the will subalternized of saints and demons that were favorable or unfavorable luck, the Church ingested in every act of life to manage and profit to the people as intermediaries unique among the impotence of the living and the omnipotence of the dead, was an oppressive power civil society.
Relieved the situation in England, Germany and the Netherlands, the Reformation, which secularized the church property and withdrew the confession depressing headset and consuming worship relics, and aggravated in France by the Dragons and the expulsion of the Huguenots, which exported to those countries, with industrial, industries in France, this country that reached in l'Ã©lite qui fait la foule, a higher level of culture, and did not like Spain, a colonial continent to order for the benefit of the metropolis, became the came to a place where the iniquities of Christian civilization, exhausting the limits human dignity and patience enlarged dwarfed by the philosophers of the eighteenth century.
The safety of life and property and freedom of thought and action, which are the subject political science, matters entirely foreign to the theology and essential bases prosperity of the people could only come from those political principles germinated in Britain when Caesar conquered Gaul, and in its natural development have come to create the government of the people by their own representatives, against the principle Christian men by government delegates and representatives of God, that was rule in the Middle Ages and the first part of the modern era. "In the seventeenth century, says Seignobos, European society had similar bases in all nations: the absolute authority of the State and the Church.
The sovereign power emanates from God and not has a limit ...
It was not possible to publish books without the consent of the government and the people could be imprisoned indefinitely.
There was, therefore, guarantee of any kind, no freedom individual, this scheme is what is called despotism.
It did not admit more than a church in each country and the inhabitants were forced to worship the state.
This and Church helped each other, governments, persecuting heretics and forced to subject to the clergy, and clergy imposing obedience to the king as a religious duty. " This was the "old regime" in England, and emancipated the Roman papal centralism, without army for external defense and without the dangers to freedom, as Fiske says - was already very attenuated, which by then was even more to the revolution 1688, the bill of rights and tolerance, and that currently only exists in the spiritual, because man is naturally more progressive with regard the stomach, that with respect to the head, because no lower-order desires food can be satisfied with fiction as the higher order, because freedom inofficious thinking is for those who do not think, is odious to those who are disabled to enjoy a pre-parental choice that excludes or makes it unnecessary to the point that every believer, Buddhist, Catholic, Orthodox, Brahmins, Protestant or Moslem feel happy and content of beliefs that are acclimated, and that by this means are the best, and as the force of all conventional wisdom rests on the argument Hottentot: "I thought our fathers," increases or decreases, therefore the number of adherents, they feel an appreciation of their belief in the acceptance of them make the other and a devaluation in the repudiation.
And while in England there is no report of violence against freedom in the order of goods, there is still violence to freedom in the realm of ideas: compulsory education absurd beliefs to children in public school, still living people who have had court convictions for crimes minds such as heresy, for example, recently abolished in 1865, and is cool even if Bradlangh twice excluded from parliament for refusing to provide the religious oath, finally abolished as well.
Arguably, therefore, that the "new regime" has been partially and gradually England from historical times, in the spirit of individual independence Germany which has developed free institutions, overcoming the formidable hurdles of absolutism Christian, for that spirit of compromise that comes in half in the composition of sanity human and not a whit in it, and thanks to which has been encountered the greatest freedom hereditary monarchy in policy by the ingenious combination of which, if king's divine wisdom is wrong, ministers pay the price.
The forerunner of this unfitness for self government and the barbarism, savagery, Cruelty and terror were consecutive in the mother country, where the human spirit was for a longer time and more diametrically away from the moral sense of human and idea of ??free institutions, by the "sacred duty of passive submission to the altar and the throne" created and played by Catholicism, and Robertson, in the same place, describes them thus: "The main purpose of the Inquisition in Spain is where the period was Saracen major sources of new thinking and knowledge.
When was permanently introduced in 1236, was greeted by a large proportion of the population with fear and disgust, and the first Grand Inquisitor was killed in Aragon.
It's a mistake to assume that something in the nature Spanish, particularly favorable to his methods.
Spanish orthodoxy is a manufactured product and represents the triumph, under special circumstances, the fan element belonging all nations. " "It is estimated that in 36 years, 200,000 lives were destroyed by the Spanish Inquisition.
Their methods were the negation of every principle of justice.
All testimony, including the criminals, children and even idiots, was valid against the accused, while it was only ear in his favor, the unsuspected, all procedures were strictly secret; the false reports were very rarely punished, and the general principle was that the accused should somehow be guilty, with the Inquisition, as Pope, infallible.
Camera torture could hardly fail to provide proof that they loved.
No rule such terror and horror has happened in any other period in European history, and only in the practices of witch-finders can be found among the wild side its systematic atrocity. " "After the failure of the Invincible Armada against England, the inquisitors decided that the cause of divine wrath was his undue tolerance of heresy, and a million Moors reluctant were miserably cast of Spain, as they had been a century earlier 160,000 Jews.
In a single auto de fe, in Salamanca, 6,000 books were burned. " "Like every Civilization game Subsisting intellectual variation, the Spain was then stripped of much of their mental and material resources, and ultimately the continued consolidated work of the Inquisition arrested brilliant literature for centuries, keeping devoid of science while the rest of Europe was accumulating.
Introducing Church inquisition destroyed the specific civilization of southern France; and from then on using the machine to the civilization of Spain reduced to starvation. " "Net income for Protestantism is the disruption of spiritual tyranny centralized.
The cracks in the structure gave space for air and light, at a time new trends that began to blow and new light to shine.
Copernicus, who died in 1543, left his teaching the world they had just established Protestantism.
At the beginning of the next century Kepler and Galileo began to extend the limits of the universe old dream.
The modern era was in full swing, and with it Christianity began its decline. " "It is clear that from mid-seventeenth century the physical sciences for his own method and mined nature of theology.
In them it was possible to test the rational and intelligent conviction, instead of eternal sterile theological debate on proposals unreasonable.
In the second half of the nineteenth century, eventually the balance of philosophical thought has been overwhelmingly hostile to Christian beliefs, and it is significant that these days his defense relies more often on their utility on its truth. "(ie, becomes the Polybius' point of view). "It has been said that while the truth vast Greece dialectical discipline, urged men to match each other's beliefs, and shape them sends Christian Church its dogmas, the modern spirit requires that fit the facts.
Roma civil law, the Palestinian mysticism and theology on the doctrine of the fall of man in Paradise by the loss of innocence, which places the state of perfection at the beginning of the species, and is exactly the reverse of the modern theory of evolution or the incessant and continuous progress, and that England has created, in other ways and in the same over time, institutions representative of that currently enjoyed by all civilized peoples, as capacity for the needs and trends of the time, as Emerson would say.
The truth, which was sought by divination in the Greco-Roman, and inspiration or disclosure in the ancient Jewish and Christian, is wanted by the observation in the Middle Ages.
Freedom and science, the two levers of liberal civilization, which is incompatible with the Christian theory of the world have taken six centuries constituted, which in just 30 years have risen to great power status in Japan, where they were preceded by the other in 300 years without result, outside the natural chain of martyrs, and in another 30 or 40 rise to China, freedom and science from the human mind has been exercised in the areas forbidden by religions, of thinking that has sprung up against bans of the Church, to civilize it a bit apart and she, too, must now under common law to search for the seduction that previously obtained by torture.
