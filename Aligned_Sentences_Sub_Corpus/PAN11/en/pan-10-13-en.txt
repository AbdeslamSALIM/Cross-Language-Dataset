The revenge, then that takes the Duchess making Ignacio see his disgrace, is a trifle, is a bargain when compared to other thousand vendettas, born of grievances of the sort.
Until that happens after I finished the novel seem even less thought, and written depriesa more than the rest.
Eulalia cynicism proudly admits his lack moving to punish Ignacio brutally in a fit of anger, leads to a scene well designed although rough naturalism which further highlights the issue of environment, the elegant mise en sc√®ne in which it occurs.
Finally, could you give many solutions to this mess it seems to me that you give less natural and believable.
If Ignacio not crazy, do you consider that its so easy woman posing as such and keep you locked in a madhouse?
Frankly, I distrust Ignatius was completely crazy but why we hide it no more you and declares, justifying the good doctor and not by comparing poorly with Pilate, and Pilate is simply wash their hands and the doctor was soiled hands and conscience with a horrible lie
