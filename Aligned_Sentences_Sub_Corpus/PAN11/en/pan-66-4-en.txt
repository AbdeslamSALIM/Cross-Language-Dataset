Tired of searching, we returned to the room, and crossing the threshold, the mysterious cough suffering character, so that increased clearly hear that he was drowning, that horrible cough degenerated into snoring in rattle, and suddenly we heard meowing, screaming horribly in all imaginable dissonances, a large number of cats.
I could have sworn that there was a hundred of these animals around us.
Let it out into the corridor with security phosphorescent eyes to see the shadows of the arcade, but nothing was visible.
Tightened the horrible confusion, I heard something was falling, and looking back, I saw Paulino kneeling knees in the middle of the room, arms crossed, and drawn in the greatest terror his face, exclaimed in awe: - Jesus!
But at that moment broke again and Paulino horrible meow could only exclaim, in a tone of terror: - Boy, is the old master! - Come, come here!
The rest of the night Antonio and I passed without a word, in separate seats of room, smoking cigarettes and seized our minds a thousand guesses, until the open window we saw the stars fade and draw the clear sky the long-awaited dawn.
As should be expected, with the light of day increased my desire to clarify the strange event, and harassment to my friend a thousand questions, which he excused himself to answer, saying everything was a mystery to him.
But despite this, I realized that I knew something did not want to communicate, and therefore I urged him that, at last, a dilapidated Manager required keys, and said laconically: - Me.
We went through the entire corridor, smiling with the morning light and the scent of the plants there had, went down stairs, traveled corridors, and finally, Antonio opened a small door that, by turning on its hinges, blew out a strong smell of old paper and chamois.
Immediately I realized it was the file of the house.
In fact, he found himself filled that dome camera bundles, folios and books stacked on several shelves and carefully arranged, as could be gathered by clear numbers and signs each bore.
He paused a moment, and toured with the view that ancient array of paper and parchment.

I exclaimed, to finish reading the document. - It appeared, said Antonio.
This Herrera Goya, it seems, was a rare entity, especially for its time.
Used to experiment with weed, insect collecting, and was up half a hundred cats who followed him everywhere.
Do not fail to cause unpleasant surprise this point, which immediately acquainted with the mystery we wanted to clarify. - I understand your shock, "continued Antonio.

And say when he died was because all the cats jumped him, digging her nails into his neck and tearing throat in rags, almost, after suffering horrible, lifeless in a pool of his own blood.
Refiri√≥me then how the Holy Office of the Inquisition forbade Herrera bury in a sacred place and how the bloody corpse was buried in the garden, where he scored his bury what I had mistaken for a seat.
The sun about to disappear, cast light upon the earth warm and reddish, and the heat coming through the open window seemed to spread throughout the room.
The columns of smoke from our cigarettes light rose up together in clouds that were nesting in the coffered wooden ceiling, and damask that covered the walls took on a richer tint than usual.
The conversation began to languish, and there came a time when both were silent, as if they obey some mysterious command.
I had some pride in that room, that putting together he possessed more courage and deep affection, and was not the first time since my chair looked all over the furniture and paintings that adorned.
Rafael also liked that collection and often praised, so I was not surprised to see it go to the hearing this motley collection of objects.
Across from where we sat, hung the wall a portrait bust of my mother, dressed in the fashion of the Second Empire.

Finally, after a short time is not turned on the light and opened the door.
Rafael was in the gallery, in the hollow of a window, and to me, seemed to wake from a dream. - Rafael ...!
I cried, but he interrupted me, saying: - Do not tell me no, no, not me I'm your best friend!

With artificial light, all things presented its usual appearance, and the portrait of my mother Inaf sweetness of her face.
Below him, on a table, was my last sonnet, I took to read it to Rafael, and I found it was wet and smudged.
