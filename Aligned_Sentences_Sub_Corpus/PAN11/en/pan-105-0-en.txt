All are men of war, i have so much to guardarfe of fus aftucia Enemies as servants fuefen fi Terni in Italy, i constantly War.
Quando eftàn in part fus Enemies can offend, fus afientan CAFAS at the edge of the Mount more afpero, i maior efpefura that there are, i do with him Fofo vn, i sleep in ETFE.
