It is good to keep in mind, finally, that virtue is far from silent, modest and of retiring, while the vice budge, shocks and stirs up everywhere.
In contrast Duchess of cheerful you paint, is certainly not a few others confined to their homes and without giving anything to say, are very noble paragon of garments used in charity and mercy.
I venture, therefore, to advise you, because she is so young and it has no reason to complain their misfortune, not a preacher goal yet, or show such stern and disappointed, and other novels that tell us less serious incidents and events and more pleasant and sweet, pouring into his satire, satire when lean, not ice, but salt and pepper, not make it bitter, but spicy and tasty.
Anyway insist advise you not to draw back and continue writing.
Although presume no prophet is too easily predict and forecast, in view of spontaneity that you write, that all future novels will be read with pleasure and may serve and serve as an innocent pastime, if not also contain, which also can be expected, moral lessons and all kinds of sound doctrine.
