I repeat that I learned the consequent feeling of such provisions, I respected and respect as a Spanish citizen, the sole state in this place, if you can just be the basis to support these provisions, it would be difficult to prove the justice, public policy and convenience which demand otherwise.
But not having taken the pen to enter into such an issue, I separate it, and step to my attempt, which is none other than give a small memory reasoned, any ideas and news of what our Philippine Islands, with the laudable object in my memory and memories of those islands, the inhabitants see my gratitude and wishes to contribute to its prosperity, which I always interesaros more expensive than I can.
As the most esplícita proof of the above, remember the Government, the Spanish all on behalf of my friends overseas, and purge the constant loyalty of the Philippine Islands not denied in any way today, but of the many terrible swings policies because the Peninsula has gone so far in this century, is a creditor consideration to all the distinguished Government today rije the destiny of the motherland, and to attention colejisladores Corps, so that when the case reached into the discussion of the special laws should govern these provinces, prevailing only the desire to make them happy, to improve their lot and condition, is reached at the end desired, and are facilitating the development of their prosperity by the most brief and simple.
Those are my main desires, and believe I can contribute in some way to illustrate the opinion of those who do not know what our Philippines, I have decided to coordinate some notes and notes that leisure time on other days I wrote about useful reforms that can and should made in the Philippines to achieve as interesting objects, such as to pursue their development and prosperity.
The committee proposes and say carries, but the stamp of authority and power of prestijio, at least the belief that long experience has given me, living in the Philippines: reason and the need to call for these reforms, the effect of the lights of the century, and see that after three hundred years that we have this beautiful part of the Asian world, just we get those precious blankets countries of birth for Spain that will put the Legaspi immortal.
His story is a test and do not object to this truth: its conquest and what the tradition has passed down to us than were those islands, every reason the need to address them with any more attention than even this, to facilitate demanding improvements, and that are subject to little or no cost.
It should be noted however, that some of the means used in its conquest, building and conservation, and any subsequent changes made, can always be useful; and based reforms such principles, and respecting their traditions and customs as do not object to those, produced all the effects are desired.
That this is so, none or very few will doubt, and therefore should repeat that the lejislador that lejisla for any state, must not lose sight of their habits and customs, and respect, as possible is moving in that attempt, the institutions that exist, as the basis of such principles, is very likely to produce the desired reforms.
On the contrary, if the lejislador maims and rips the story of a country, destroying their institutions, and does not respect ancient customs all for carrying into effect the changes that theory has been strongly advise your imagination, you can with the utmost good faith, intention and desire, can not cause harm to compensation, for easy and even possible is that in this case the people start to grumble, keep bitching and moaning, and conclude by lifted as powerful as it is, and to the carelessness of the further lejislador war with its disasters, and the revolution with their crimes.
So, keep in mind that laws should be similar to that given country, they always respected in certain principles, fundamentals and practices that are rooted more and more, and strengthen the prosperity of peoples and happiness of their inhabitants.
Lately, I hope that when you get into the hands of my friends in the Philippines this small tribute of my gratitude, I dedicate them, only to see it my votes directed by happiness of those provinces, and across much of them can write, no more ambition than the step of giving an idea of ??its importance and merit, to promote useful reforms demanded the preservation of peace, alleviation of taxes, and improve their status and condition, providing for such honorable means prosperity for all its inhabitants, which the fancy for all can be more expensive than Luis Prudencio Alvarez.
The Philippines, for its great expanse, its advantageous position in the center of the world Asia's trade, by its considerable population, and the fertility of its soil, susceptible how many are bred productions between the two Tropics, claiming the Government of the Metropolis an orderly system of orders and reforms, while more and more entrenched their peace and internal security, as indispensable as necessary to the preservation, promotion agriculture, industry and trade to that eminent degree of prosperity to which they are called for the many items which themselves contain rich, and he seems are destined for Providence, which has been lavishly promoted with the situation and as bright as fertile soil.
Encouraged me, and wanting it so interesting purposes are made, I have determined to form this small memory, with the dual purpose of releasing news of the state as they were the Philippines to my departure from them, and presenting some of the many obstacles to development of prosperity and wealth, and means that could be used to destroy them, excite the greatest talents of others, with more time to address this important subject, to more thoroughly and more precisely, spread abroad his comments on the subject, to influence the mind of the enlightened Government today rije destinations in the country, and provide by this means the useful reforms to the state of the provinces of the Philippines calls for advance prosperity and greatness.
For my part I will stick as much as possible, to indicate only the effect as an EXPERIENCE twelve years of residence in the Islands has taught me, can help to establish the field justice more fixed than that observed, and improve the administration of the estate public: branches must undergo major reforms in the day as they are, and can produce wonderful effects and incalculable benefits, so the islands as to the metropolis.
I hope that those who deign to honor me by reading my humble thoughts, I waive all their indulgence for defects to be noted, purely to see in my desire lines laudable improvements in the Philippines in the classes that you made mention, and if these poorly coordinated any benefits or phrases proves useful for those countries, with only this would be rewarded with interest the wishes of the speaker, for the satisfaction of having contributed to the achievement of very interesting objects in any part, however small that this was a unique event that yearns Award for the zeal which cherishes in his heart to such a degree as that but for the good and happiness of all the inhabitants of those islands, whom professes the purest affection, retains and always keep the best sympathies and fondest memories.
