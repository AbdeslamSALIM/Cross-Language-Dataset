To write as I figure it was necessary to gather and form a vast apparatus of scholarship, and for this I always lacked patience.
I can not see the multitude of tomes, ancient and modern, written in different languages, where I would take the local and temporal color my projected work required.
And since it is planned to free myself from his obsession and to prove to you that if I can, I want to please, I'll put here in a very short project summary. * * * * * In the reign of Alhakem I, for the years 218 of the Hegira, was in Cordoba, a wealthy merchant named Abu Haf치z the Goleith, a native of nearby site of Fohs Albolut.
In his bazaar, located in one of the main streets, were gathered the most precious objects of human industry and of what occurred in the Iberian Peninsula as it brought from remote regions of Baghdad, Damascus, Bocara of Samarkand, Persia, India and the little known vast empire of Cathay.
Abu Haf치z ships had their own, they went to the Levant ports to provide themselves with goods.
On a spring afternoon came in the bazaar of Abu Haf치z a lady covered, accompanied by her maid.
Although he did not see his face, he admired the grace and elegance of her walk, leanness and elegance of her figure, a certain ineffable prestige seductive as the bright halo around it, and the aristocratic beauty of its white, beautiful and well manicured hands.
Abu Haf치z, full of pleasure, was offering before his eyes, and putting on the counter, a thousand strange beauties of jewelry and fabrics.
He was very curious.
The merchant said - yet I have shown, Sultana, the most splendid treasures pilgrim my store. - And why hide it and do not you show me? - She said. - Because I am interested and do not want to work for nothing.
Show me your face and in return I'll show my best wealth .
