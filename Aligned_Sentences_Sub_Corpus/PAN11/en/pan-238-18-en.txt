Lola had sent him a sarcastic smile that you just exasperated.
Raimundo looked surprised.
When no one heard them used to tutearle. - Annoyance?
None. - Yes, because apparently, you were very comfortable next to this lady ....
And not being able longer to restrain his impulses, he said dully: - Come with me.
It took the dining room where tables were already waiting for the guests.
There in the hollow a balcony, vented his anger.
Filled him with insults and hath broken relationships definitively.
He came to shake her violently by the arm.
Alcazar was so stunned, so terrified, who failed to respond.
This saved him.
Seeing her face painted broken where pain and surprise, Clementina could not fail to understand that anger was cheating.
In no Raimundo had been no intention of flirting.
Look, from now on do not talk about me.
The servants who went there, looked on the corner of my eye and winked malicious.
When leaving Pepa Frias encountered.
The buxom widow was very well dressed, had heard endless compliments.
Foreign princess wore the time of Charles III, silver lama recamos with gold and blue velvet cloak.
Daughter, I can not wait more, give me something to eat, or I fall.
Clementina was laughing at a corner and made him serve some dishes.
Alcázar became the rooms very happy, but even by the violent trembling emotion that his mistress had actually experience.
Never seen her so angry.
Her friendship with Pepa was riveted from the scene we have described earlier.
The widow was convinced that the salvation of his fortune was based on this love and tried to promote it.
Thanks to him, was rescued and gradually, a large part of it.
Carmen had a Will in favor of his stepdaughter, and even though the lady had improved somewhat, was certain death in a short time.
Doctors it had discovered a tumor.
They dared not operate because of its extreme weakness.
A lot Clementina made her grace the ease, even better, the cynicism of Pepa.
Both were chulapas, two manolas born too late and in condition little wealthy to their social nature.
Of course, it was much more Pepa legitimate Clementine who did not carry the mass of blood: veniale hobby. - Look, Clemen, you're decrying - I said it, while voraciously devoured a piece of turkey in aspic -.
To whim has already been enough. - What do you know what it's worth? - Clementina replied laughing. - On the traces, the daughter ....
Dulce seems to be made in the Alliance.
It takes more than a year in relations you, and still gets red as a turkey when you order. - Well, that's precisely what I like.
Pepa shrugged indifferently. - Really?
For me it would be a calamity, my dear. - And Arbós, how he behaves? - This is an utter fool, you know - said with his mouth full - but at least has facade.
In saying that he is a great man is thrown headlong into the water for you ....
I placed in the Ministry more than two dozen relatives ....
Yesterday, in fact, I had a visit Mauritius Chamber, who wants at all costs be undersecretary.
Then Curling soon: - It is a rogue you know?
a scoundrel, who can not even keep the decorum of their women.
Most of the days waiting at the exit of San Pascual and the accompanying foot to his house.
Although a bad husband, who has dignity.
What more do you want to see it that monigotillo humiliated! ...
I put him on a contraption seguidita in his head that would not fit through that door.
The exaltation of his spirit kept him from swallowing nicely. - God bless you, daughter - he concluded by saying rising -.
See if this heart is still for a while.
Pepa wanted to suffer from a broken heart that he was only calmed by eating.
A few minutes after leaving two friends in the dining room, Clementina gave the necessary orders and the buffet was opened solemnly.
Real people first entered accompanied by his servants and masters of the house.
Remaining Salabert had his dinner.
The large dining room ceiling coffered ceiling like a blaze of gold.
The flowers of vivid colors, exotic fruits, the silverware, glassware, under the powerful gas lamps flickered like heaven star, producing a strong glare.
In the two heads of huge burning room oak logs in fireplaces paths carved oak reredos, whose ornaments almost reached the ceiling.
All the dishes that were on the table had come from Paris accompanied a retinue of servants and scullions.
It exempted the fish, which came from the Cantabrian and a pudding evening arrived in London.
However, there hot consommé you asked.
Real people were very few moments in the dining room.
So I rushed out in it the wave of the crowd with hard little ceremony.
The halls were silent on power of the servants, that with regularity and precision of soldiers changed the spark plugs next extinct by new ones, while the dining room resounded with the ringing of the dishes and cups, the talk and laughter of the guests.
Cobo Ramirez left for a while leaving Esperancita held by its rival, to sit in a corner table in front of a wheel and eat a few pieces of boeuf d'Hambourg and ham.
Of course, Ramon took advantage of this relief to highlight the contrast between his frugality poetic and prosaic Cobo gluttony, until he stood feet Esperancita crossly telling her friend Paz, who was on the other side: - Well, I like men who eat a lot. - Me too - said Pacita -.
At least indicates that they are sick stomach. - I do not I have not - was quick to say the councilman, suffocated and annoyed by the attitude hostile to the two girlfriends had been placed.
The general Patiño, tired of sending deadly projectiles Calderón's wife without the square give cognizance even had lifted the siege to lay siege to the Marquise Ujo that the grenades had capitulated first opening its doors to the enemy.
However, general, and strategically accomplished, never lost sight of Mariana, waiting for any incident favorable to fall back on it.
Was said in the newspapers that was to be appointed Minister of War.
This charge, of course, would give it more prestige and authority to enter the alarm anywhere.
The Marquise of Ujo Turkish wore suited her so well that, by Alcantara, wanted to let go a shot.
At every step the illustrious general was seen in the need to help in such daunting task.
This he had evil laugh what happened a while ago, when Clementina suddenly appeared where she was with Alcazar.
He spoke as if he had pulled the gallant to her friend, protector accent and disdain that would have made a leap to the proud daughter of Salabert if by chance the I had heard. - Poor Clemen!
Is clear that tightening force, and sooner or later it's going to hurt, but anyway ....
Especially now that he is tarnishing the skin of a horrific way.
It has always been the face very hard.
And while his eyes looked clear and smooth Castro with such sweetness, you really was for indigestion.
He had always been told (and it was true) that his face was very sweet.
Castro nodded to all, both flatter and by the ill will that had to Clementina.
Lola was not interested, but following his break with it was a bit comforted celebration: although this had no small part a desire not to appear defeated the eyes of the world. - And you think you really love that kid looks like a schoolgirl Sacred Heart? - Go figure!
Clementina boasts much original.
Look what he is casting glances tender baby from afar.
Raimundo, standing there in the end of one of the tables, not take his eyes off his beloved, who was back and forth from one place to another by preventing the desires of those who most wanted guests please.
From time to time sent him a faint smile carrying intelligence the young to the seventh heaven.
Pepa Frias, if not eat because I was gorged, pinched in fruits and sweets, taking behind his chair to Calderón, Pinedo, Fuentes and three or four gentlemen thugs throw enjoyed in the language.
He defended himself admirably of stopping and answering all the shots with skill. - Where does it say you have gout, Pepa? - On foot, Pinedo, feet ...
where you have the talent. - Even if you insult me, I wish I could remove that drop ...
It would be a drop of aromatic essence - Minister of State said a sweet sick. - What do you know, man, if you have not gotten the nose rather than the chorus of both sexes?
Everyone laughed at the reference. - But how cruel you are, Pepa! - Sources said still laughing -.
Those who are not here We know nothing ... (I say, gentlemen, I speak for myself), odor, color or flavor you; but we do not disenfranchise you figure out something that is tasty and tender. - Tender? ...
Are you in an unfortunate error. - I say I see ...-- said bringing his face to the lush bosom of the widow ...-- Y by the way: what brings you on that pin?
The whole group came a spontaneous laughter he brought the heads of those who were near.
Fuentes was shortened for a moment, but as a man of genius who was known to recover. - I will be mono, Pepa, but you're really cute. - Bravo, Fuentes, bravo! - Said Calderon, who, as a man exclusively due and have, caused astonishment any appropriate sentence.
The shooting continued even after leaving the majority of people in the halls.
The group was reinforced with some Pollastre.
This was the reason I get up Pepa abruptly after saying, - I'm going.
Populated shortly after the dance halls again retired real people.
Was to dismiss the same ceremony, that is, the serried ranks at the door of the hall, the Royal March by the orchestra and the dismissal of the owners until the staircase.
Clementina breathed freely.
A slow pace, enjoying the pleasure of having completed a task hard, went through the halls directing his laughing eyes everywhere, leaving flow her lips nice little words to the friends with whom stumbled.
That splendid dancing, maybe the most magnificent that had ever taken a particular in Spain, his work was almost exclusively.
His father had supplied the money, but her activity, taste, artifice.
Listening the congratulations to all the step murmured, lulled into a heady satisfaction esteem.
Happiness reminded her of love, its indispensable complement.
Acometióle a keen desire to change with Raimundo, alone, some tender words of affection, some fleeting caresses.
And buscóle with eyes in the crowd.
Raymond had wandered all night through the halls almost always alone.
He had expected the dance with childish desire, promising pleasures live and ignored.
I had never attended one of these brilliant celebrations of aristocratic society.
The reality did not correspond to their hope, as always happens.
All that vain ostentation, luxury scandal unfolded before their view, instead of stroking his pride wounded him cruelly.
Never felt so alien in world that had long frequented.
Your thoughts, directed towards the melancholy, representáronle his poor home, where his fault very soon going to miss it necessary, modesty of his holy mother, who did not hesitate to perform the simplest tasks of the house and his innocent sister, that she had learned to be economical and hardworking
