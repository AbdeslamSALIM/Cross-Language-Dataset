Today, there is more than a place of travel which begins to rise again amid rubble, thanks to the interior and agriculture of the great advantages offered by the navigation of Magdalena.

Honda City is the restraint or center of two entirely different regions: Southern and Eastern regions of the upper Magdalena admirable, towards the north, the endless wilderness, the burning deserts and the recurrent likeness of the lower Magdalena.
