These are antics, Emilio.
At one time, I say .... - No, Pepa, no, the proverbial skin of you are in Madrid.
And would give anything to have him Irene like you. - Is it better than Maria Huerta? - Asked ironic twang, which not guessed, no But much irritation.
Pepa plan had changed: he thought it would be much better to take the diplomatic channel.
A boy as Emilio, who had been unruly until then, it was easy to lure him with affection.
He, in the darkness of the car had been red. - The Mary Huerta is worthless. - So you like.
All men are the same thing about changing the ears and tail.
Look, Emilito - said taking his hand, - I had to reñirte much talk very seriously say bitter things ...
but I can not, I have a heart so stupid that for all offenses is apologize.
Today you have made a mark evil thing, enough to Irene to separate from you, but to me it seems to me that is not as great as it sounds, because you are a dazed boy.
I'm sure you yourself do not you explain the seriousness of it ....
Pepa continued his sermon sweet tone and persuasive.
Emilio, he expected a dash of insult, was pleasantly surprised.
Escuchólo with submission, and then, with trembling voice, began to apologize.
Truth that had flirted a bit with Mary Huerta, but swore he was not interested in her.
It was a matter of pride.
When he was married to Irene, Mary had told this house Osorio Irene did not understand how a husband accepted a guy so ugly and pointless.
Then swore he would swallow those words was already achieved.
Otherwise what love and what pumpkins!
I had never been in love with Mary Huerta and thought to be. - I could not believe you were in love, because you've always had good taste ....
Because in short, that woman is nothing but a bundle of rags ....
If you saw the broomstick as it may well take his place ....
But you see, Irene believe it and you have an obligation to avoid these troubles.
If I were in your case I would give them, puppet - added seizing fondly of the ear -.
I have you would know it tided my skirts. - I believe - said the young man directing a long look that had nothing to subsidiary -.
You Irene has more resources. - Why? "- She asked another look little maternal. - Because you are a woman more complicated, it needs more study.
By the same token, I would time for boredom. - What do you know that, mamarrachillo?
You talk about me as if I only knew by heart. - What else would I! - Go, Emilio, you're not clown!
The conversation continued in this light-hearted and loving as the carriage rolled through the streets bleak.
In that dark corner, rocked by the motion of the springs and dazed by the noise of the wheels to jump on the floor, the whisper became increasingly intimate, more insinuating, busy all the time by chuckles and sweet little words.
In both had taken a soft tenderness; Pepa for having found his son so docile, it to see his mother so loving and compromising, thinking to find a fury.
Animated with its success, caressed by the sweet confidence suddenly established between them, did not stop compliments.
Pepa got angry or upset pretended, gave pinching fierce called him a hypocrite, flirtatious, shameless.
If it were true I would be glad, because that would some influence on you to make a good husband.
Out of the car, face on, more beautiful than ever, said: - Upload a moment: I have to give the watch to Irene, that you forgot yesterday.
Emilio's arm rose and went with her in his cabinet.
Meanwhile, Irene came home in an agitated state in easy to understand sensitive girl and loved her husband.
Emilio's conduct that night had upset, had put too nervous.
And for a grand finale, the violent scene which provided between her mother and her husband, which would perhaps his final break with it, filled it terror.
So, I just jumped to the ground before the door, a sudden rush of a live irresistible desire, remounted hastily, saying the driver: - A Mom's.
He opened the outer door serene: the floor the servant who had been watching and Master output waiting to go to cost. - Where's Mom? - In the front room with Miss Emily.
He went to the boudoir.
Then, overcome with terror, doubt, anxiety, threw himself into the room concealed by curtains of brocade which thought he heard a rumor.
At that moment the curtain rose and her husband appeared agitated and upset, staring with terrified eyes.
XII # Matinée religion. # A few days later, at eleven o'clock on a Friday of Lent, the finest wild Madrid came from a peaceful sleep and deep with the firm intention to marry the daughter Calderon.
He opened his eyes, walked by the horse ornaments hanging on the walls of his room, stretched gracefully, she drank a glass of lemon that was on the table night and prepared to rise.
Not claim that the said order to come to his spirit during sleep, but it is undeniable that it must have operated in a mysterious work that benefited significantly.
Because at the time of going to bed, thinking only vaguely Castro this fruitful union.
He opened his eyes, his determination to achieve by hand Esperancita every means in their power was now irrevocable.
Thus welcome wholeheartedly the lucky girl and carefully follow the noble savage in the task of perfecting the Nature cunning work that had been carried out to create you.
The servant had already prepared the bath.
After taking a look in the mirror to observe the face the day, this is yours, took a ball of iron and made them some moves.
Took a foil and threw back a few times.
Then applied a few dozen punches straight on the pad of a dynamometer.
Fact which he thought came the moment of getting in the water.
Inside it was even when he appeared in the room, unannounced, Manolo Dávalos. - Pepe, I have to tell you about something very serious - he said the lunatic Marquis, with unit mystery eyes more lost than ever. - Wait a little, let me leave the bathroom. - Go early, it is urgent.
The marquis rose from his chair he was sitting and began to walk around the bizarre stay with some trepidation, to which his friends were accustomed.
I could not keep still five minutes.
If any hiciese after half a day of movement he would fall surrendered before nightfall.
Castro followed his movements with mocking eyes and dismissive.
But these eyes became serious and anxious to see his friend approached to the bedside table and began to play with a gun that there was precious. - See what is loaded, Manolo. - I see, now - he replied, smiling, and turning suddenly: - What they say in Madrid, if I kill you now have a shot?
Pepe Castro felt some tingling in the back, which was not produced only by water, and laughed in a strange way. - So, today, I could do with impunity - remained very cheerful the Marquis -.
Because as everyone says I'm crazy .... - Ha, ha!
The philandering laugh again as the rabbit.
It was not cowardly, in contrast, had a reputation for fastidious and swordsman, but, like most courageous public needed.
The prospect of a dark death at the hands of a madman, did not damn funny.
Examples of Seneca, Marat, and other remarkable men who died violently in the bathroom failed to give any amenity perhaps because they had no news.
But even serenity had to yell: - Leave the gun, Manolo!
If you do not leave do not return to see in your life to Amparo. - Why? - Said that lowering the gun with bereavement painted eyes. - Because I do not want, for the advise that you do not let in more at home .... - Well, man, trouble not thyself ....
It was a joke - said rushing to put the revolver in place.
Castro went to the bathroom immediately.
The first thing he did when he was involved in the cap that dried Turkish, was to take the gun and keep it low key.
Quiet now, but irritated by the shock that his idiot friend had given him, began to speak gruffly and negligible, while the mirror lavished on her beautiful figure, with all due respect, all the care that was owed. - Let's see, man, out with the secret ....
It will be a stupid thing of which you get used to ....
Kid yourself, Manolo, you're not to go out.
You get a priest - said while rubbing her arms with a fragrant ointment that he had taken from the battery jars and jars of all sizes before him.
The Marquis put his hand in his pocket, and pulling out her wallet and a little note of a woman, said with no little solemnity - Amparo just wrote me this letter.
I want you knowing about it.
Pepe did not even turn his eyes to look at the document that his friend exhibited.
Absorbed in the task of stroking his mustache with a beard brush, said in a tone distracted: - And what does the Amparo?
The Marquis looked surprised at the lack of importance given to this beautiful letter. - Do you want to read it? - If it is not very long ....
Manolo unfolded with the same care and respect that if an autograph from Santa Teresa Jesus and read with trembling voice: "My beloved Manolo: send me the favor of the giver that I need two thousand pesetas urgently.
Now if you do not, do not forget to bring him home this afternoon.
I guess that they are not've sent. - No. - You did well. - It's that did not.
Just to see if you can facilitármelas is what I have come.
Castro turned to him and watched him a few moments between angry and surprised.
Returning then view mirror, he said quietly contemptuous: - Dear Manolo, are a large melon.
I'm sure if now inherits your aunt, handed over the legacy of the Amparito for the engullese as it has done with your parents.
Manolo was furious to hear this.
There she was, not who had ruined him, but the rogues of the stewards.
Was a girl under excellent conditions for a housewife, a portent of domestic arrangement: while generous, capable of accommodating any life for the love, etc., etc.
The manic Marquis spoke with warmth and eloquence by the eulogy of his beloved. - Do you know where all evil? - Said dully, after a long pause -.
In my family deprived me, for no reason, to marry her.
What I wanted was a mother to my children, you know?
Nothing more than that.
They would have been happy and me too.
Pepe Castro became speechless.
For the pale cheeks of a few tears rolled Marquis of emotion.
He made a gesture of sympathy and continued grooming mustache.
After few moments of silence, said: - Exemption, boy.
I have not those two thousand pesetas, but although you can be sure I had that would keep me from going to give them to you if used as you say.
The marquis was silent and began to stroll through the spacious bedroom. - Who do you advise me that the asking? - Said stopping suddenly. - A Salabert - Castro replied grinning in the mirror.
It is cowardly because you are at home ....
And he began to gnash their teeth and rolling eyes that gave him fear, but did not attack his friend.
Making a supreme effort to hold back, vented his anger against throwing hat the ground, so that it destroyed.
Castro was stunned, made a statue.
A thousand times he had joked with him saying things much stronger, real insolence without ever would have thought angry.
And now, a very simple joke, sat in anger of that strange way.
He tried to calm him with some words of apology but Manolito not listening.
Although it withdrew from the first idea to throw on him, began to walk like a caged animal, muttering threats, waving his arms and gesturing strongly.
Relent soon, however. - Never thought you, Pepe - concluded by saying in an agitated voice -.
I never thought that the greatest friend I have had to insult me, I had to stick the dagger to the hilt .... - But, man! ... - Do not talk, Pepe ....
God forgive you as I forgive you ....
I am like a rabbit hunter who wounds and runs to his dying den .... ....
This simile of rabbit made such an impression after being handed down, which dropped sobbing in a chair.
At the same time he was seized with a strong fit of coughing, which dropped mouth by a prodigious amount of rails, but the locomotive had crossed the throat, try as he did, in any way he could throw.
Castro made him drink a cup of lime juice with orange blossoms.
When the foolish marquis was done, that ending was dressing himself.
Which came to the right street and severely dressed in ceremonial dress day.
Lunched in Lhardy, gave a tour of The Wilds, and three in the afternoon, more or less, drove to his aunt the marquise de Alcudia, located in San Mateo Street.
This scathing lady was very jealous of religion as we know.
The same of their ancestry, not to say more.
Castro was her second cousin, and though his life had upset skull rather, he had always treated with great affection seeking to attract the right track.
For more vile a man did, it was always a gentleman, as a priest always a priest.
In this pious lady thought Castro who followed him in his business.
His instinct (which was much more admirable than his intelligence) said that if the Marquise to marry him take charge of the girl probably get Calderon.
It was great prestige in her aristocratic society: higher still among those who were added to it because of money, and Calderon.
Alcudia Palace was a bleak factory built at the beginning of last century.
A floor under large barred windows, one upstairs, and nothing more, but the house was in a perimeter huge and had a large garden behind pretty sloppy.
The site was flat and not very dignified: the rough-hewn stone staircase and worn out.
The late Marquis was thinking in a reform when it took the death.
His widow left the project, not so much Greed, for the horror that inspired all sorts of reforms even if they were lime and singing.
Tapestries valuable dressed the walls, paintings of the best painters adorned some ancient parts, such as shipping and oratory.
This was a marvel of luxury.
Occupied a corner the floor, but its roof was the principal: therefore as high as the a church.
Had large stained-glass windows and the Gothic cathedrals: I was carpet as a ballroom, there was a small platform with its organ, the altar was pretty, French style, and in the middle stood a magnificent Ecce Homo de Morales.
In the family room the girls were alone with the work of his hands.
He went there after a moment to joke with premiums. - Can you, Aunt? - Adelante ....
He provided a chair, and while Aunt Eugenia did crack the pen with your hand dry and nervous, began to coordinate the exordium of the speech that he thought direct.
It gave the few minutes a great stroke strident should correspond to its heading, and tearing strongly glasses, said: - I'm yours, Pepe.
This lowered his eyes to the ground on demand, no doubt, inspiration, stroked his mustache, coughed slightly and then said with solemn emphasis: - Aunt, I do not know if God has touched me in the heart or is that I'm tired of life I've been, but it is certain that a little while now remember much of the advice has given me many times that I'm wanting to formalize, to break these habits undignified that the lack of a father and, above all, a mother and you have made me buy.
Friso and in the thirty and I think when I remember the name.
I meet him, and also with my quality of Christian ....
Because in the midst of my excesses I have not forgotten that never belong to a Catholic family in Spain and now our class is responsible to ensure religion, by example as you do ....
The best means to promote this change I feel in my heart is getting married ....
The gallant young man could not choose better words to catechize Aunt Eugenia
