The storyteller and fall on who was, could not be other than Aponte.
I assure you, and pay me very talkative dog. - Was not that the informer.
However, had I been, you would hit so bad, for if your father asked him, I know not how could hide the truth. - He could say he did not know, he did not hear the bell of the clock of the Holy Spirit, who ...

The emotion experienced Rosa deprived of the use of the word, filled with tears her beautiful eyes. - You're no good preacher, Leonardo said, perhaps with the intention of distracting their attention, because you matter too much possession. - With respect to Aponte, Rosa continued after it had calmed down, I know it is a talker, but in honor of the truth, I must say that your father knew the time you got back by noise that was made in the hall with the opening of the door, the carriage entrance and the tramp of horses.
With the silence of the night, every noise is thunder.
He awoke, lit a snuff with the tinder-box, looked at his watch and gave a cry of anger.
It was two thirty in the morning ...
Still know you in the face of bad night.
There was another brief interval of silence between those two parties, during which Leonardo esperezó yawned and different times, until he stood up and said: - I go to sleep ...
He turned and began the ascent of the staircase of his bedroom, step to step, which if you count the steps or cost you a great effort.
The mother, meanwhile, was followed eyes, without saying another word or move in the chair, but that he lost sight in the highlands of the stairs, briskly stirred and called loudly: - burst!
A more pressing call, was quick to respond in own person the butler said in the previous chapter.
It was a short man in body, stocky, dark, round face and very curly hair, so in appearance and in manner stated resolution and agility.
Although dressed in clean, came in a vest, translucent leagues that came from Asturias, uncommon type of Spanish then in Havana.
Butler was at Don Candido Gamboa, and whether certain books had not dealt with on the desktop, as in other committees more in line with their employment.
When he appeared in front of Dona Rosa, was the pen behind ear, and she said in a tone of command: - Resale, Gamboa tell you to send me to twenty ounces.
Augustine Dubois watches, and buys you the best repeater that has recently received Geneva.
Granted it would cost a fortune face, if that did the very villain.
Gold watch, repetition, Swiss, I mean, Geneva, from the previous Geneva received by the watchmaker Dubois, who lives on the streets of Lieutenant King, the other door of the pharmacy of St.
And in a break ... - Listen!
I limit myself to 18 oz.
You want the best repeater, Geneva legitimate regardless.
In fact, in just over an hour Butler was back and turned over to Dona Rosa a small box, square, morocco, with gold fillets.
No doubt this lady was waiting for him impatient, because take, open, contemplate for a short time with a kind of joy child up and go into his room, with no further case of Butler, was all one.
It did not take longer than just using the relationship of the comic scene.
Leonardo on his part, so sure was he that would not get the sun of that day without a new watch came to decorating his costume in the pocket of his trousers, having laid them on the couch in front of his bed, he lay quiet, determined to sleep and repair forces broken by fatigue and lack of sleep last night.
Dozed only when the sound of tiny footsteps and clothes of a woman, came to confirm their hope.
Pretended to be asleep and watched quietly approached the couch, lifted up his pants, put in the front pocket something round that shone long, hanging from a belt pink and blue silk, forming water, more than an inch wide and six long, subject the ends by a gold buckle.
Smiled with pleasure, and closed his eyes, to her mother retire upon the persuasion that he had prepared a surprise.
Returning Rosa pants on the couch, watching the tape of the clock is visible and slide in the pocket of his waistcoat two ounces left over from the purchase of the former, he felt that his son had moved in bed.
He started as if he had been making a crime and then, in fact, came a ray of light in his consciousness of mother vividly recalled the words of her husband's conversation in the early morning, and felt a kind repentance.
Something inside her told her that if she did not actually evil, not be not a well known and their proofs solid tender and loving with Leonardo when not born of merit made by him, but the spontaneous outpouring of his heart and indiscreet mother.
Puzzled, including pick up the garment, something to keep it for more opportune time, and face hence the distress and unpleasantness of the son, stood still, as transfigured.
He, although brief, was a crowning moment for the sad mother.
At last he cast a furtive glance to the bed, he saw Leonardo naked from the waist up, arms on the pillow and the beautiful head resting on the palms, chest open and lifted, raising the aspiration and down on the breath, which the wave does not break, long nose, mouth ajar to give free passage to the entrance and exit of air, pale countenance the Sleep and agitation of the day, but full of health and strength, a sense of pride took over his whole being, changing suddenly and completely the order of his thoughts. - Poor!
Enjoy and have fun, because, as you lasting health and the youth, which will come to you, as they have been for us all the days of trouble and sorrows.
The Blessed Virgin, in whom both trust and put all my hope, will not to hear my prayers.
She will protect and serve the good of the world's dangers.
God make you a saint, son of my heart.
He moved his lips together as a sign of throwing a kiss, and was so creeping like wine.
PART TWO CHAPTER I Ossa venientibus later. (Those who arrive late to the banquet gnaw the bones.) We have to stop for a short time these characters, to deal with others not being inferior braise, represent our true history minor role.
We refer toilet now famous clarinet, José Dolores Pimienta.
To see him with the needle in his hand sitting on the couch together with other officers to tailor a low platform, tacking a coat of dark green cloth, still tops or skirts, strength is that we get to the master tailor Uribe on Wall Street, the gateway immediately the corner of Villegas, where there was a dry goods store called the Sun The first of these facilities consisted of an oblong room with three entries: that of the primitive gate wide and high, and the two windows, whose gates had been removed.
Against them longitudinally, there was a long narrow table on which were various pieces of denim, quilted, Arabia, of a genre called nutsedge cotton, satin and fine cloth, all coiled and stacked at one end.
And to the opposite, lying two Mahon fabric pieces, which had already drawn a pair of pants for men with a sliver of soap ashes.
Behind the table or counter, standing in shirt sleeves, white apron tied to waist, scissors in his right hand and tossed around the shoulders, as a tape paper folded in half along its length, with stitches here and there, was the master tailor Uribe, a favorite at the time of the elegant youth of Havana.
Although I would like, I could not deny the black, white mixed with that owed its origin.
It was high-class, lean meats, carilargo, was disproportionate arms, nose flattened, eyes bulging, or flower of the face, small mouth, and while barely fit in it two strings of teeth sparse, wide and lips, her lips blackened, very thick and pale copper color.
Short pin used, the cleric, sparse and curly, like the hair, although it is thicker and erect in tufts on his head giving the same appearance assigned by the fable of Medusa. [29] As a tailor who had set the tone in fashion, wearing denim pants Uribe adjusted legs, narrow top, figuring an M italic, without the final link, and the indispensable leather straps.
Instead of the shoe bootie, then in general use, wearing thongs Cordovan, exposing feet that had nothing to boys, and well shaped, because of showing too much bunions, were only bridge.
However little would prevent in favor of Uribe looks, no doubt it was the kindest of the tailors, very ceremonious and if not paid on the ability of your scissors.
He was married to a mulatto like him high, thick, unwrapped, who at home at least, liked to go both legs, dragging the satin slipper, and to teach more than what suited decency, back and plump and glistening shoulders.
Began the afternoon of one of the last days of October.
Up and down many carriages wagons and carts the narrow streets of the Wall, perhaps the busiest of the city as the most populous central and be all stores of various kinds.
The noise of the wheels and the horses' feet on the stones, sounded like continuous thunder inside open houses to the winds.
Not infrequently clashed against each other, and obstructed step for a long time.
In such a case, the thunder of carriages and the voices were happening the suits from the road and rickshaw pullers, without regard or respect for the ladies.
The transient walk, if I wanted to be trampled by horses or crushed against the walls of the Bocines houses with projections of the wheel hub, had to take shelter in shops until it cleared the road.
On the evening of which we speak now, there was one of those frequent collisions between chitin occupied by three young ladies, coming down, and a cart loaded with two boxes of sugar, up.
Force clashed with opposing hubs of both vehicles, the result of which the second wheel up first and came by his rays, yielding one.
The shock two carriages were almost across the street, the chitin in the rear to the door Uribe's tailor shop, which penetrated the head of the mule cart.
Carry On, which philandering had been sitting at one of the boxes of sugar, with a whip in his right hand, lost his balance and hit the mud and stones of the street a terrible his side.
And this man, African by birth, as well as the other, black, Havana, rather than come each in his respective vehicle in order to undo the mess and to facilitate passage with dreadful curses and insults are rammed each other, blind with fury wild.
No was that they knew were at odds and had to avenge past wrongs, but being the two slaves, oppressed and mistreated by their masters forever, with no time or means to meet their passions, they hated to death purely by instinct and vented that anger was owned, at the first opportunity presented to them.
In vain the ladies of chitin, very startled, screamed to the sky, and most of them repeatedly threatened to coachman with a harsh punishment if he did not give up the fight and took care of the restive horses.
But the fighters, in their anger and lashes rain that was dumped, not heard word.
Then the Spanish shops, tailoring officers, all looking out at the door in his shirtsleeves, increased noise and confusion with his spokesmen and laughter, signs of joy to some who witnessed the fight.
In this, a poor man came in through a door degustation of tailoring, to avoid the carriage wheels, and leaving the other arm extended above the fallen bellow and came off the comb tile head of the youngest of the girls, thus the long braid of her hair abounds developed and disentangling all, over his back with silky, shiny waves which Totí wings.
She gave a cry and put both hands to the head, at which time, José Dolores Pimienta, so far as spectator others, made an exclamation of surprise, "murmured the name of" Virgin of bronze ' and jumped on the thief, or rather on the dam, which had carried her in triumph.
Achieved claw throw, but was brittle as hawksbill and was, moreover, nicely set, is I was shattered in his hand only thing he could return to his grieving and frightened owner.
A confusion for the thief escaped, though none other than the official tailor lie had stopped at that occurrence.
If I say that you see visions. - No, answered dryly José Dolores.
I know what I'm saying
