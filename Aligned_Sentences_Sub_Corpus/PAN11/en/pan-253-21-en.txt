His first pictures were gathered at the crowd curious.
Desnoyers watched him carefully: "It looks like a good person." His instincts order man felt flattered by the grave and serene air of General of the Republic.
Suddenly experienced a great trust, similar to the one that inspired managers Bank of good looks.
This man he could trust interests, without fear hiciese crazy.
The avalanche of enthusiasm and excitement to finally drag Desnoyers.
Like all those who around him, lived minutes were hours and hours that seemed years.
The events are trampling; the world seemed to recover within a week of long quiescence of peace.
The old man lived on the street, attracted by the spectacle of the crowd waving civil to the other uniformed crowd leaving for the war.
Evening on the boulevards witnessed the passage of the demonstrations.
The tricolor flag colors fluttered under the electric lights.
The cafes, overflowing audience, throwing swollen mouths by their doors and windows the musical roar of patriotic songs.
Suddenly he opened the crowd in the middle of the street to applause and cheers.
All Europe went there, all over Europe - except the two empires enemies - spontaneously greeted with cheers to France in danger.
Iban parading the flags of the various peoples with all Iris inks, and behind them the Russians, with clear eyes and mystics, the English, with bareheaded, singing religious songs of gravity, the Greeks and Romanians, aquiline profile, the Scandinavians, white and red, the North Americans, with the noise a little childish enthusiasm, the Jews without a homeland, friends of the country of revolutions equal; Italians, arrogant, like a chorus of tenors heroic Spanish and South American tireless in their cheers.
Were students and workers who honed their skills in schools and workshops, refugees had taken to the hospital in Paris as beach Shipwrecked Members of wars and revolutions.
Her cries had no official significance.
All these men moved with spontaneous impulse, anxious to show their love to the Republic.
Y Desnoyers, moved by the sight, thought that France was still something in the world, still exerted a moral force on people, and their joys or misfortunes interested to humanity. "In Berlin and Vienna - he said - also cheers at this time ...
But the country no more.
Surely, no stranger ostensibly to join their protests. " The people of the Revolution legislator on the Rights of Man collected the gratitude of crowds.
He began to feel some remorse at the enthusiasm of foreign who offered their blood to France.
By day, the mainstream led him to the Gare de l'Est.
A mass of people thronged against the fence, spilling into the streets near tentacles.
The station, which was acquiring the importance of a historic place, like a narrow tunnel through which tried sliding around a river, with great shock and kindled against the walls.
Part of France in arms throwing this out from Paris to the battlefields of border.
Desnoyers had only been there twice, to the leg and the return of his trip to Germany.
Other now undertook the same way.
The popular masses were coming from all ends City to see how they disappeared inside the human mass contours station geometric, uniformly dressed, with rhythmical flashes of steel and accompanying metal shock.
The glass half points, shining in the sun like mouths igneous people drink and drink.
In the evening went on the parade by the light of electric bulbs.
Through the gates spent thousands and thousands of horses, men with iron-lined chest helmet hair and earrings, as well as the champions of remote centuries enormous boxes cage that served as the condors to aeronautics; beads long, narrow canyons, painted gray, protected by steel bulkheads, more similar to astronomical instruments that drains to death, masses and masses of red kepis moving with the pace of progress, and rows of rifles, a black and bare, dismal form reeds, others topped with spikes appeared bright bayonets.
And on these restless fields of grain steel the flags of the regiment quivered in the air like colored birds: body white, blue wing, the other red, a gold tie at the neck and above the peak bronze, iron spear pointed to the clouds.
Of those dismissed Don Marcelo returned home to vibrant and tired nerves as which has just witnessed a spectacle of rough emotion.
Despite his tenacious character, that always refused to acknowledge the error itself, the old man began to feel ashamed of their previous questions.
The nation lived, France was a great people; appearances had deceived him as to many others.
Perhaps most of his countrymen were of an ease and forgetful delivered in excess to sensuous life, but when came the hour of danger, simply did their duty, without needing the last taxation suffered by people under railways to organizations.
On the morning of the fourth day of action, while leaving his home instead of moving the went downtown with opposite direction, toward the rue de la Pompe.
Some imprudent words Chichi and the restless eyes of his wife and his sister made him suspect that in July had returned from his trip.
Felt the need to see from afar the windows of the study and if this could provide news.
And to justify to their own conscience exploration in contrast to their intention to oblivion, he remembered that his carpenter residing at street. - Come to see Robert.
A week ago I promised to come.
This Robert was a tall boy who had "freed from the tyranny outs', in his own words, working alone at home.
A piece about underground room and served as workshop.
The companion, which he called "my partner" ran with the care of his person and home, while a child grew hung on to her skirts.
Consented to Robert Desnoyers their declamations against the bourgeoisie, because they paid to every whim of incessant furniture arranger.
In the luxury housing of the Avenue Victor Hugo, the carpenter singing International moving while the saw or hammer.
This and great boldness of Mr forgave language, considering the cheapness of their labor.
Upon arrival at the small shop she saw him with his cap over one ear, baggy corduroy to the Mamluk, spiked boots and several tricolor flags and ribbons on the lapels jacket. - You're late, boss - said cheerfully -.
The owner has been mobilized and within a few hours will join his regiment.
He pointed to a paper written fixed on the door of his hovel, like posters print contained in all establishments in Paris to show that employers and dependents had obeyed the order of mobilization.
It had never occurred to her carpenter Desnoyers could become a soldier.
Was rebellious to any imposition of authority.
I hated the flics, police in Paris, with he had changed his fists and sticks at all turns.
Roberto spoke enthusiastically of the regiment, of life among comrades, taking the death to four steps. - I believe in my ideas as before, pattern - continued, as if guessing what I thought the other - but war is war, and teaches many things, among them that freedom must be accompanied by order and command.
When war comes you see things differently than when you're at home doing what he wants.
The night I killed Jaures roared with anger, saying the next morning would revenge.
He had looked to their partners of their section to find out what they planned against the bourgeoisie.
But the war was about to explode.
Something in the air that is opposed to civil strife that left in momentary oblivion particular grievances, concentrating all souls in a common aspiration. - A week ago - continued - it was anti-militarist.
I still think as before: I love peace, hate war, and like me, all comrades.
But the French have not led to anyone and threaten us, they want to enslave us ...
Let wild beasts, and that force us to be, and to defend well, nobody out of line, that everyone obeys.
The discipline is not incompatible with the revolution.
Remember hosts of the first republic, all citizens, like the generals that soldiers, but Hoche, Kleber and others were rude compadres who could send and impose obedience.
In addition to newspapers and pamphlets of "the idea" had read in books loose to Michelet and other artists in history. - Let us make war on war - he said -.
We will beat for this war is the latest.
His statement did not seem quite clear, and continued: - We will beat about the future, we will die so that our grandchildren will not know these calamities.
If the enemy triumphed triumph continued war and conquest as the only means of aggrandizement.
Would take over Europe first, then the rest of the world.
We recover Alsace and Lorraine because they were ours and its people want to come with us ...
Let to beat us by our security while the security of the world, life of weak nations.
If it was a war of aggression, vanity, conquest, we would agree of our anti-militarism.
But the defense, and the rulers are not to blame.
The carpenter, who was anticlerical, showed a generous tolerance, an open mind comprising all men.
The day before had found the mayor of his district to a reservist who was going to go with him joining the same regiment.
Used this euphemism for the priest could not suspect him foul intentions.
The two had shaken hands. - I'm not the Calotte - continued, turning to Desnoyers -.
Some time ago I started wrong with God.
The war flattered his hobbies egalitarian.
Before her, speaking of the coming revolution was a wicked pleasure imagining all the rich, who lose their fortune, they would to work to survive.
Now I was excited to participate in all French the same fate, regardless of class. - All backpacks and eating ranch.
And he extended the military gravitas for who remained behind the army.
The war would bring great Shortages: everyone would meet ordinary bread. - And you, master, that is old to go to war, have to eat like me, with all million ...
Desnoyers was not offended by the malicious satisfaction that inspired the carpenter future deprivation.
A man like that, an opponent of all existing and material had nothing to defend, going to war, to death, by a generous ideal and far, to avoid that humanity knew the horrors of the future today.
Hours later he returned to find the carpenter near the Arc de Triomphe.
Group was Several workers look like him, and this group was linked to others and others who were as a representation of all social classes: well-dressed bourgeois, fine gentlemen and anemic, discharged tuxedo worn, pale face and thick glasses, smiling young priests with some malice, as if engaged in a skull.
And a musical roar, a chant serious, menacing and monotonous emerged from this mass of mouths round pendulum arms and legs that opened and closed as well as bars.
Roberto energetically sang the chorus warrior.
Shaking eyes and drooping mustaches of France.
Despite his corduroy suit and canvas bag packed, had the same look great and heroic figures of Rude in the Arc de Triomphe.
The "associated" and the boy trotted by immediately to accompany the sidewalk to the station.
Eyes from them to talk row with a partner, shaved and looking serious: surely the priest who had known the day before.
Tuteaban Maybe now, with the fraternity that inspired men to contact death.
Followed the millionaire with a look of respect to his carpenter, disproportionately enlarged to be part of this human avalanche.
And his respect was something of envy: envy awareness arising from unsafe.
When Don Marcelo spent sleepless nights, nightmares, a source of terror, always the same, haunted his imagination.
The vision was always fearful that he had to collect documents credit agreements concluded with his signature, and he, Marcelo Desnoyers, man faithful to their commitments, with a past of spotless integrity, could not afford.
The possibility of this made him shaking, and after waking her chest still felt oppressed by terror.
To upset their lives with the turmoil of war, reappeared the same anxieties.
Wide awake, in the use of reason, suffered a punishment equal to that experienced seeing his name in his sleep without honor at the foot of a bad document.
All the past came before him with extraordinary clarity, as if even then had remained blurred, in a confusion of darkness.
The land of France was threatened yours.
Fifteen centuries of history had worked for him, he found the open progress and amenities eyes that know not their ancestors.
Many generations of Desnoyers had prepared his coming to life struggling with the land, defending it from enemies giving birth a family and a home free ...
And when it came his turn to continue this effort, when he reached the turn in the chain of generations, fled the same as a debtor avoids payment! ...
Had contracted by coming into the world's land commitments their parents with the human group which had existence.
This requirement was necessary to pay with their arms, refusing to sacrifice danger ...
He had eluded recognition of signature, absconding and betrayed its ancestors.
Never mind material success of their existence, the wealth acquired in a remote country.
The restlessness of his conscience was proof.
So were envy and respect he felt for that poor workman going to meet the death to other beings equally humble, impassioned all for the satisfaction of having met, the sacrifice accepted.
The memory of Madariaga came to his memory. "Where we are rich and have a family, there is our homeland." No, not true to say the centaur.
Far from home of origin and when it does not run any danger, you may forget a few years.
But He now lived in France, and France had to defend itself from enemies who wanted to suppress.
The performance of all its inhabitants, rising to Desnoyers mass represented a shameful torture.
Given these satisfied men of his past made him turn pale.
No one remembered their own, but he knew him, and it was enough.
Vainly tried to calm her right inside the storm ...
Those had been other times: there was no unanimity of the present time, the Empire was unpopular: everything was lost ...
But the memory of a famous phrase was fixed in his memory as a obsession: "There remained France!" Many thought the same as him in his youth, and yet had not fled to avoid the service of arms had been trying to the last and desperate resistance.
To understand the political and religious ideals are essential explanations and demonstrations: the feeling of the country does not need any of this.
And the workers of the cities, incredulous and mocking, the selfish laborer, the lonely shepherd, all move to spell this word, understanding it instantly, with no previous teaching. "We need to pay - he repeated mentally Don Marcelo -.
Seemed strong, stayed strong for his age, but it was beyond sixty years, and only young people can be good soldiers.
But the fight is nothing more than an accident struggle.
The heavy, shocked, and sacrifices are the operations that precede the match, endless marches, the rigors of the temperature at night to ceiling, remove the earth, digging trenches, load trucks, from hunger ...
Even had an illustrious name to slaughter could serve as an example.
He was not alone in the world, had a son who could answer the debt of the father ...
His son was not French: belonged to another people, half of his blood was from various sources.
His family felt awe to see the shrink and the gentleness with which he moved into the house.
The two servants imposing gesture had gone to join their regiments, and the biggest surprise they reserved the declaration of war was the sudden love goodness, the abundance of gifts to his farewell paternal care in guarding their travel arrangements.
The two had to struggle not to accompany them to the station.
Outside his house slid with humility, as if mutely beg pardon to the people who around him.
Were times of economic crisis: the rich momentarily knew poverty and unrest, the banks had suspended operations and paid only a tiny part of their deposits.
The millionaire was deprived for a few weeks of their wealth.
And yet, never appreciated the less money Desnoyers or disposed of it with greater generosity.
Many popular aspect mobilized loose marching to the stations found to a man who stopped them shyly, he carried a hand to his pocket and left in his right hand the twenty-franc note, fleeing immediately to their astonished eyes.
The workers returning to say tearful farewell to his men saw the same man smiling little children marching beside them, stroking his cheek and walk away, leaving in their hands five-franc piece.
Don Marcelo, who had never smoked, attended the offices of snuff.
Leaving them with hands and pockets full, to overwhelm with a bounty to the first packet soldier was
