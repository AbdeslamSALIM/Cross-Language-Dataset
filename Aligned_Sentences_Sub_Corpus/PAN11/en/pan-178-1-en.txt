Before leaving her house went into the doctor, who was taking the opportunity to greet the almost daily visit to my uncle did, particularly since his last serious illness.
He was a young man who would walk in their thirties, not very stout, but stout complexion; short hair and beard, black and strong, looking strong, but not harshly, nice face and voice of words very sober, clean, loose-fitting, modest dress, and a native of a village of coastal Nansa.
This was all that he knew at that time.
His visit was brief, and very graciously said goodbye, leaving very pleased that I find in Tablanca, more by what was written on the face and mediquillo air, that the weights their clothes made by my uncle to introduce me.
