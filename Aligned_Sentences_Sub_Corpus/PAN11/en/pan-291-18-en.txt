And if there were some riots or conspiracies or surveys, the main and most movers brought to Cuzco to a safe place, where squeeze themselves into a prison that was full of wild animals such as snakes, snakes, tigers, bears, and other bad bugs, and if anyone refused, they said that those snakes would not do wrong, and if lied, that would kill him, and this madness had and kept at that.
And in that dreadful prison had always, for crimes they did have a lot of people, which looked at time to time, and if his luck that he had been bitten hobiesen will not [to] some of them, sacábanlos, showing great pity, and dejábanlos return to their land.
And in this prison guards had who were sufficient to guard her, and to care tubiesen feed them that were lit, and even to the bad bugs that had there.
And true, I laughed good wins Cuzco when I heard it used to be the prison, and although they told me the name, I do not remember and therefore I do not put [74].
In times past, before the Incas reigned, it is understood that something very natural these provinces did not have the people together as we now have, but their strengths strong, they call pucaraes [75], which he left at will give one to another war, and so were always modest and lived with great work and anxiety.
And as the Incas ruled on them, Paresce bad this order and the way they had in the villages, mandáronles, trying in some parts with praise and other threats, and in all places with gifts they were doing, to which he is for the good of not living like savages, but before, as men of reason, set their towns on the plains and foothills of the mountains together in neighborhoods, such as and how the disposition of the land as ordered, and in this way, the Indians left pucaraes that the first had, ordered their people the right way, and in the valleys of the plains, and in the mountains and plains of Collao, and for which there was no anger on fields and fields, they were dealt Incas terms, pointing out what each one had to have, where they set limits to knowledge of those who had and then Dellos Nascar.
This clear what the Indians say today, and I was told to me in Xauxa, to where they say that one of the Incas were divided between them the valleys and fields today have, with which orders have been and remain.
And in many places one of those who were in the mountains, ditches pitches were taken from the rivers with much greater delicacy and wit which were taken out, and all peoples, the one and the others were full of quarters and deposits of kings, as in many places it is said.
And they understand how much work would walk a country so long and to where each league and at every step had new language, and it would be great difficulty understanding them all by interpreters, choosing the safest, ordered and sent, under severe penalties to put it, natural that all of his empire and knew they understood the language of Cuzco generally and they and their wives so that even the creature left chest hobiese his mother, when she began to show the language had to know.
And though at first was difficult, and many do not want to put in more languages ??may learn from their own, Kings could therefore that came with your intention, and how well they meet tovieron its mandate, and so true it is understood that in time a few years was known and used a language in more miles and two hundred leagues, and although this language was used, all spoke theirs, which were many, although I write not believe it.
And as a captain come out of Cuzco or any of the apricots to take account or residence, or justice of the commission for, among several provinces, or to visit what he was commanded, not talking in another language than that of Cuzco, nor they with him.
Which is very good, brief, high-comprehension and supplies of many words, and so clear that in a few days that I tried, I knew [it] enough to ask me many things wherever he went.
Call the men in this moon language [Rune], and the woman Guarare [huarmi] and to the father yaya, and brother [76] guayqui [Huauque] and sister to [77] Nana [Nana], and the moon keel, and the subsequent month, and wadding year and a day click [Punchau], and at night tota [tuta], and at the head called oma and to the ears lile [Rinri], and the eyes naui [Ñahui] and to the nose sunga [zenca or singa] bankers and teeth [Quiru], and to machinery and arms to the legs chaqui.
These words only get in this crown, because now I see that to know the language formerly used in Spain, go changing, wise one to one and other to another, for the times to come, is for God to know the events that have, so for if he comes something cool or to forget that language and so ensued as people used, they are not hesitating what was the first or the general, or where it came from, or what about this more is desired.
And therefore I say that was very beneficial for the Spanish have this language, as she could to go everywhere, some of which are already losing.
In this kingdom of Peru's public fame among all natural, how in some towns the region of Puerto Viejo is used abominable sin of sodomy - and also in other how bad would have land in the rest of the world.
And I notice this a great virtue desto Incas because, being masters as free and had no one to realize, and neither had any such powerful among them who fetch it, and that something else did not understand the nights and days that lust to be with their wives, and other hobbies - and never say or that none of them used the above sin, before they hated those who used it, having them in just as vile to timid, as gloried in such filth.
And not just in their people did not find this sin, but even consented to be in their houses or palaces no they knew who used it, and even without all this, I think I heard that if they were know of anyone who had committed such a sin, punished [him] with such punishment, it was noted and known to everyone.
And in this there is no reason to doubt, but rather has to believe that none Dellos fit such a defect, or dried apricots, or many other nations, and those who have eScript Indians generally, generally condemning this sin, claiming that they are all sodométicos have acargádose it and, indeed, are forced to recant, then wanted to ANSI condemn many nations and peoples, which are far more clean on this from what I can say.
For, leaving aside the Puerto Viejo, in all of Peru did not find these sinners, but as it is in every place and in all places one, or six, or eight or ten, and these, that secret They would sometimes be bad, because they had by priests in the temples, who is famous in the holidays they will mate with the gentlemen, they thought committed they were doing evil or sin, but by sacrifice and deception of Satan was used [78].
And even that by chance could be that the Incas Inoren such a thing in the temples was committed, [and] disguised as something it was not to be bad cysts, and they think that enough sent by all parties to worship the sun and the more their gods, meddle in proibir religions and ancient customs, which is death to pair them that nascar them take them off.
Anyway, it was one of the richest temples there in the world.
