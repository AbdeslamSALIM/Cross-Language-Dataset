Rafael, overwhelmed by this strong mother who was the soul of the party, promised not to return more to the blue house, not seeing the loss, as he called Dona Bernarda, with an intonation that word was whistling.
But then dated the conviction of their weakness.
Despite its promise, again.
Was lost paths, taking long detours, hidden as a child when going to comrades to eat fruit in orchards.
The encounter with a peasant, with a little boy or a beggar, made him tremble, to him, whose name is repeated throughout the district, and a time to time I will get the popular investiture, the eternal dream of his father.
And appear in the blue house had to pretend that reached by a free act of will, without fear.
Thus, without the knowledge of his mother, continued to see a woman up eve of his departure for Madrid.
Rafael Arriving at this point of his thoughts, wondering what prompted him to disobey hope his mother, braving the terrible outrage.
If you want to follow friends, be provided they treat me like a man.
And looking at him with her green eyes, light, evil, sat at the piano and began a ideals of those songs, as if to the magic of art to raise a barrier between both.
Another day I was nervous, the annoyed looks of Raphael, his words of amorous adoration, and said with brutal frankness. - Do not you get tired.
I can no longer love: I know a lot of men, but if someone make me return to love, would not you, Rafaelito.
And he there, insensitive to scratches and downs of this terrible friend skirts indifferent conflict with the blind passion might provoke at home.
To tear of such an attraction in the past thought that woman was said that despite its beauty, its aristocratic air, culture with which he dazzled him, poor provinces, it was only an adventuress who had run half the world, from each other arms.
It was a great thing to get, make her lover, felt in the carnal contact comrade of princes and famous artists, but it was impossible, why insist engaging and breaking the tranquility of your home?
To forget fumbled the memory of words and attitudes, trying to turn them into weaknesses.
Savoring the joy of accomplishment, when after the gymnastics of thought in it will without wanting to possess, a eunuch satisfaction which includes cold and indifferent, like pieces of dead flesh, the naked beauties lying at his feet.
At the beginning of his life in Madrid was believed cured.
His new life, continuous and small satisfactions of self, the greeting of the officers of Congress, the admiration of who came there and asked him a ticket for the bleachers, the partner being treated as by these gentlemen, many of which his father spoke with the same respect that if were demigods, the honor being called, he, who with loving Alcira tuteaba whole familiarity, and rub in the most conservative banks with a battalion of dukes Counts and Marquises, youths who were deputies in addition to the distinction which gives a dear beautiful and a good racehorse, all this drunk, stunned him, making forget, believing completely cured.
But to get to know your new life, losing the charm of novelty these compliments self-esteem, became the tenacious memories to surface in his memory.
Y gave a love of imagination, in which the distance to that even more beautiful women.
He felt the longing to return to their city.
The absence and distance seemed to pave obstacles.
Courts to be closed, and obeying the instructions of the supporters continuous and Dona Bernarda asking him to do something - whatever it was - something beneficial for the city, an afternoon, first thing, when in the chamber were not more than the president, the mace-bearers and a few journalists asleep at the podium, raised up with lunch the throat with emotion, to ask the Minister of Public Works busiest on record works Alcira defense against the encroachments of the river, a behemoth that had a sixty years of life and was still in childhood.
After that I could return with the aura of practical deputy, "zealous advocate for our material interests, "as he titled the local weekly, organ of the party.
Y That morning, off the train, between the grips of the crowd, the deputy, deaf to the Royal March and alive, stood on tiptoe, looking to see what distance between the flags, the blue house with masses of orange.
Arriving in the afternoon she bristled emotion the skin and pressed his stomach.
Thought seen his mother, a lover of his prestige and fearful murmurings of the enemy; those demagogues morning peered at the door of the cafes mocking the demonstration, but all his scruples vanished when he saw the oleanders near high and sharp thorns, the two blue pillars that supported the green door bars, and pushing this went into the garden.
Extend√≠anse orange trees in rows, forming streets of red soil, wide and straight as of a modern city pulled line, where the houses were dark green domes and glossy.
On both sides of the avenue leading to the house, stretched and laced High rose their thorny branches.
From the sound of the breeze stirring the trees and the chattering of sparrows flew around the trunks, Rafael felt distant music, the sound of a piano barely touched fingers, and a husky voice, shy, as if singing to herself.
Rafael knew the music, a lieder of Schubert, the favorite of that time, a teacher who "was still the best for picking", he said the artist learned slang of the great musicians, referring to were only more vulgar popular works the melancholy composer.
The boy moved slowly, afraid, as if fearing that the noise of small steps that melody which seemed to rock the garden lovingly, asleep in the golden light of late.
The plaza in front of the house, and saw the palm trees rustling again, banks masonry seat and back of floral tiles.
The door was closed.
By using a half-open balcony stood a piece of blue silk slightly curved: the back of a woman.
Rafael steps made a dog bark at the bottom of the garden, ran cackling the chickens pecked at one end of the square and the music stopped, hearing the drag of a chair, as if someone put up.
Appeared on the balcony a large light blue gown.
And bowing his dark blond head, laden with thick braids, as a former golden helmet, He smiled with friendly and cheerful confidence: - Welcome, Rafaelito.
We have already heard of triumphs came to this desert and live music.
II From Valencia to Xativa, across the vast expanse of rice fields and orange cover Valencia holds that people under the vague title of the Bank, no one could ignore the name of Brull and political force that meant.
What if he had made national unity and the country or further divided into Taifa waliatos as when there was a Moorish king in Carlet, another in Denia and the other in Xativa, the regime Elections held a kind of inviolable dominion in each district, and to go in the government of the province's political map, provided that were set in Alcira, said the same. - There are safe.
It was a ruling dynasty that came thirty years on the district, with ever greater force.
The founder of the sovereign house had been Rafael's grandfather, Don Jaime Ladino, who had amassed the family fortune with fifty years of slow exploitation of ignorance and misery.
It started as a clerk at City Hall, then clerk of the court was municipal clerk of the notary and assistant at the Land Registry.
Employment was not often of those who put in touch with the poor law that he did not monopolized, and thus, justice as a favor selling and using the arbitrary and guile to dominate the rebel, was making way and appropriating pieces of rich soil that he loved forward a miser.
Bummer solemn all the time talking about the article so many of the law applicable in the case poor gardeners had much faith in his wisdom and fear of his malice, and came to seek their advice in all conflicts, paying as a lawyer.
When he made a small fortune continued in the modest functions to keep on your person the superstitious awe that infuses the peasants all that is on good terms with the law, but instead of being a beggar, eternal applicant farthing of the poor, devoted to them out of trouble by giving them money with the guarantee of future crops.
Giving money to loan seemed a meanness.
The troubles of the farmers were when the horse died and had to buy another.
For this, Don Jaime is dedicated to sell to gardeners beasts more or less defective work that gave him some Roma and Valencia he put to much praise as if it were the Cid's horse.
None of installment sale.
Cash money, the horses were not his - as stated with his hand on his chest - and owners wanted to cash them immediately.
All I could do, in obedience to his great heart, weak to the misery was looking for money for the purchase, asking for any friend.
Fell into the trap the hapless farmer driven by the need and took the horse after signed with all sorts of loan guarantees and responsibilities of an amount not had seen, the Don Jaime, a representative of a hidden being which provided money, Jaime gave the same gift, representing the owner of the horse.
Total: acquired the rustic a beast without haggling over the double of its value, having also borrowed an amount with growing interest.
In every business of this, Don Jaime was twice the capital.
Then came inevitably the plight of the victim, interest piling up, the new concessions, still more ruinous to tame Don Jaime and give a month's break.
Every Wednesday, market day in Alcira and large agglomeration of gardeners, street where don Jaime lived was a jubilee.
Had to request extensions are delivering some pesetas as a funny gift that did not influence the reduction of debit, to request additional loan humbly, timidly, as if they came to rob the miser Rabbula, and the strange case was that, as neighbors noticed, all these people after all he had left there, going happy-faced satisfaction, as if he had to get rid of a hazard.
This was the main skill of Don Jaime.
Usury knew as a favor to present, spoke always on behalf of others, the hidden owners of the money and horses, men without belly pressed him making him responsible for the mistakes of borrowers.
And so, quietly, the poor Don Jaime acquired a field here, then another there, then a third which united the two, and return a few years formed a beautiful garden orange, acquired more traps and trickery to cash.
That was enlarging their properties, and always smiling, spectacles on his forehead and stomach increasingly voluminous he looked among his victims, tute√°ndolas with brotherly affection, patting when they came back with new requests and swearing that he would die in the street a dog that obsession with doing favors.
That was thriving, but the taunts of the townspeople made him lose confidence of that flock of rustics who feared him as the law and believed in him as in Providence.
A loan to a spendthrift mayorazgo made him owner of the stately mansion since became Brull family.
Bernard, Church paid holidays and was always next to the mayor, whoever he was.
For him Alcira was already in others, than to get the crop picked up thousands of dollars; the others were the rabble.
By then, freed of the offices he had played low and letting businesses usury in the hands of those who previously served as intermediaries, he began to worry about marriage of his son Ramon.
It was his sole heir, a bad head genius alter their welfare tranquil surrounding the old Brull rest of their prey.
The father was an animal satisfaction at seeing big, strong, bold and insolent, making respect in cafes and casinos, more so for his fists than by giving the special immunity money in small towns.
I did not want his only son to carry him around like a machine. - Much gold! - Exclaimed with contempt which is not attracted to the outside - much gallon, but ultimately a slave!
He loved his son free and powerful, continuing the conquest of the city, completing the greatness family initiated by him, seizing people, as he had taken the money.
Would be a lawyer, the race of men who govern.
It was a longing for old Rabbula; see your stem retracts with head held high in the preserve of the law where he had introduced always cautiously stated on many occasions dragged out a string to the foot.
Ramon spent some years in Valencia, without being able to leap beyond the run of Right, damn right that the classes were in the morning and he had to lie down at dawn, at which time the lamps are turned off that focused its light on the green table.
He also had in his room in the guest house a great gun, a gift from his father, and the nostalgia of the gardens made him pass many evenings in the pigeon shooting, where he was better known than in college.
One fine specimen of manly beauty, big, muscular, tanned, with eyes compelling, hardened brows, was created for action, for the activity, was unable to focus their intelligence in the study.
Old Brull, that greed and prudence, had his son on half-rations - as he said - only just sent him money to live, but his victim rather than those with trickery that once exploited the peasants, had to make frequent trips to Valencia, looking Under certain usurers who made loans to the child in these circumstances, the insolvency could lead to jail.
Up to Alcira came rumors of other exploits of the prince, called him to see Don Jaime the nonchalance with which he spent the money.
In family gatherings friends were talking scandal to the escapades of Ramon, a fight game as a matter of output a casino, a father and a brother, ordinary people, in blouses, who swore to kill him unless married with some girl who accompanied the workshop day and night to dance.
Old Brull would not tolerate any longer the escapades of his son and made him leave studies.
There would be a lawyer: in the end did not need a degree to be a character.
In addition, he was ailing, it was hard to watch in person the work of their gardens, and needed the help of his son seemed born to impose his authority to those around him.
He had long since turned their attention to the daughter of a friend.
At home they felt the lack of a woman.
His wife had died shortly after he retired from business, and the old Brull was indignant at the neglect and lack of interest of the maids.
To marry Bernarda Ramon with her, an ugly girl, sullen, sallow and lean meat, which inherit their parents three beautiful gardens.
In addition, it called attention industrious and economical with parsimony in its expenses that bordered on stinginess.
Ram√≥n obeyed his father.
Educated in the prejudices of rural wealth, believed that a person decent not oppose the union with a female ugly and unfriendly, if fortune had.
The father and daughter understood each other perfectly.
Touched the old woman watching Briefly serious and indignant at the slightest waste of the servants, shouting at When colonists felt the slightest slip in the garden and discussing and fighting with buyers orange for a penny more or less the arroba.
This new daughter was the consolation of their old age.
Meanwhile the prince was hunting in the morning in the nearby mountains, and spent the afternoon in coffee, but no longer met the applause of those gathered around the table pool, or visiting heading upstairs.
Coterie sought serious people, was a friend of the mayor and talked about the need for all wealthy people were together to get into a fist to the rascals. - It stung ambition - "the old man cheerfully to his daughter .-- Let him woman, he will open step ...
A minor objection consistory was for him a personal affront, ending discussions on the street with threats and beating his greatest glory was that the enemies were saying: - Beware Ramon ...
And with his aggressiveness, showed to be captured friends, a sumptuously that was the torment of his father.
Doing favors, kept all those whose revulsion at work and poor head were fearsome, gave money to those who served as heralds of his rising fame in taverns and cafes.
Soon time was mayor, his influence, finding close the city, spread across the district and found strong support in the capital of the province
