Clementina, between joyous laughter, embraced him and covered his face with kisses, exclaiming: - Little Boy, you're delicious!
X # A bit of civil law. # It was very hectic morning at the offices of Salabert.
They made a payment of consideration.
The Duke had gone in person to the box to the cashier presence and help in the task of have tickets.
Despite his years handling money, never played pay an amount that will rise a little hands tremble.
Now I was nervous, attentive, crispadamente biting smoking and no spitting.
On several occasions drew attention to the employee to believe that spent two tickets instead of one, but was wrong at all.
The cashier was diestrísimo in his office.
When finished, the Duke went to his office, where he was awaiting M.
The animals mecores I've never had it has taken you - he replied with a foreign accent, smiling a slavishly M.
Fayolle. - Waste of Paris is what you bring me.
But do not think that I cheated.
I know it time, monsieur, I know for some time.
Only I can not see that face and as cheerful as frescota no surrender.
Fayolle smiled opening her mouth to his ears, revealing a big yellow teeth. - The face is the spec of the soul, Duke.
The other day I saw him on the street of Alcala hooked the phaeton.
Sake of world stopped to watch.
They talked for a while horses that Duke had bought.
Fayolle enthusiastically defended the amateur and merchant.
In a moment of pause said taking out his watch: - I will not bother you more ....
Between laughing and then said angrily: - But, man, they are not happy but you never sacándole one money!
At the same time put his hand into his pocket and pulled out his wallet.
Fayolle always smiled, saying, I was sorry, because the Duke was a poor and did not like asking anyone to take alms, etc., etc.
A portion of little jokes that the banker does not seem to listen, attentive to count tickets.
Had seven hundred pesetas and handed, while pressing ringing for an extended dependent on receipt.
Fayolle also attended and said: - It is wrong, Duke.
The pressures of the horse was four thousand.
Here there more than three thousand.
The Duke gave no signs of hearing.
It can not be ....
The trader told. - There are three thousand five hundred .... - You see you!
I was not wrong. - Is that the horse costs four thousand: and we have acoustic.
No man, no, the horse costs three thousand.
On that understanding I bought it. - Sir Duke, you are wrong - Fayolle said getting serious -.
Remember you had remained in the four thousand. - I remember perfectly.
A watch (addressing the dependent who came to extend the receipt), one of you come down to the garage and ask Benigno on what has been adjusted Pollio.
At the same time, seizing the moment in which the employee looked Fayolle, winked expressive.
The driver replied dependent mouth of the horse had been set at three thousand five hundred pesetas.
I was quite sure that had remained in the four thousand.
In that case it was delivered.
Otherwise never have let the horse out block.
The Duke left him talk all they wanted, running only a grunt of course, but without altered little or much.
Only when told to stay Fayolle again with the horse, said with sarcasm: - Apparently, you found yourself which of the four thousand and want to undo the deal, right? - Sir Duke, I swear to you by the most sacred thing there is nothing that ....
I'm only sure it is as I say.
The banker will then promptly undertook a loud fit of coughing.
Then he calmly wiped his mouth with a handkerchief and noses, folksy accent and said: - Men, do not be stingy.
You is not altered by these miserable pesetas.
But he did not let go.
The vendor wanted to take the horse.
There a moment of silence.
Fayolle was about to throw everything rolling and shameless, but was repressed whereas nothing would move, least bring the matter to court.
Resigned, then, with flushed cheeks still be fired without the Duke not to take him very politely to the door, giving loving pats on the back.
When the hero resumed his seat at the table, under your weary eyelids shone a grin of triumph.
After a few minutes pulled the bell button again: - Go and see if the duchess is alone in her room or have seen - told servant who came to the point.
While carrying out the commission remained inactive, with the body thrown back and hands clasped in an attitude reflective. - The duchess is visiting with the father Ortega - the servant came to say.
Salabert made a gesture of impatience, and was again lost in his thoughts.
Was determined to hold a conference with his wife about interests.
He did not ever believed in the case of giving account of his speculations and business.
Ms Carmen does not understand anything if you give her.
It was believed absolute master of his fortune without that you pass by the imagination of the rights she was his wife.
But lately a friend opened his eyes.
Speaking of the disease that afflicted the duchess asked naturally, if he awarded will.
This friend, who was a lawyer, was solved by half of the estate belonged to Ms.
Salabert was deeply worried.
The easiest way to dispel those fears and impotence leave relatives of his wife, was that this hiciese testament to his favor.
The Duke found it naturalísimo.
In the conference which was to have with her, I propose more diplomatic as he could, so as not to alarm you about your illness.
He waited, therefore, to review papers entertained until he thought the time to send again raised whether the father had cleared Ortega.
But when would she entered to tell him that there were a few gentlemen, including Calderon, who wanted to see him.
But loudly and then taking campechanotas and abrupt ways that were peculiar, shouted: - To pass, to pass these gentlemen.
Calderon presented, and two other bankers Urreta no less important and well known in Madrid.
The expression of all of them was serious and even sullen.
Salabert, without noticing it, began handing out hugs and pats on the back, making a tremendous noise with their voices and laughter. - Good business!
I think you also need a good hull like me ....
And you, Manuel, when you think pop? ...
You see your nephew runs a hurry.
The bankers were polite and quiet, trying to cut with a serious attitude that chanzonetas flow.
For no good reason.
About a year ago that had Salabert railroad sold the property to B *** S ***, already in operation and all his material.
Although not determined in writing, including when convínose come out to auction the railway from S *** V *** a, however it was linked to the other, physically and economically, Salabert not submit bid specifications, leaving the business to them.
Well, they had just know that the Duke disregarded his word, he tried to swipe decares: there submitted a corresponding statement in the auction.
The Marquis de Arbiol smiled contemptuously. - He wore the stamp of his home. - He wore the label? - Said stopping suddenly -.
No rogue I know from what gone.
And more and more angry was to press the doorbell button. - Now you'll see!
Now if I see you have won or not ....
Arbiol glanced at his teammates and shrugged his shoulders with contempt.
But the duke, he saw perfectly the gesture, he would not take care of him, continued growling, snorting, uttering expletives furiously violent and walking around the room.
Until Llera was presented with a group of subjects he cramped, badly dressed, vulgar physiognomy.
Salabert stood in front of them crossing his arms with energy: - Let's see, Llera: it is necessary to find out who the rascal who has filed a Statement in my name, supplanting my signature for railway tender to V *** S ***.
Employees also looked at him intently.
Llera then looked down and the Cabora the end without a word.
Salabert walked his bulging eyes several times by them in theatrical expression of anger, and he exclaimed at last going to the bankers: - Did you see clear?
I suspect that has to be more than one.
I will not rest until they send them to prison ....
Soon you will fall upon the weight of justice.
Criminals should be well hardened to judge by the utter indifference with which were those ominous words spoken with an accent pathetic.
Everyone retired quietly at his apartment and resumed his task, as if the terrible sword of Nemesis no segarles was coupled to the neck.
At last one of them, biting her lip for not laughing, stretched out his hand with a gesture of contempt: - Bye, Salabert, hasta la vista.
The others did the same without saying another word about it.
The Duke was not fazed.
To dismiss was attentive to the ladder, directing still looks angry passing employees who received the same offense indifference.
Passed between them like an actor going through the racks state after a while on stage.
A few minutes later turned out down to the rooms of his wife.
Found her alone, entertaining read a book of devotions.
Ms Carmen, who had always been very devout in recent times had surrendered completely to religious practice.
The disease is separated each more of worldly ideas, delivering sad and submissive to the priests.
Never Salabert as obstacle to this devotion, compassionate look at her with indifference, as an innocent hobby.
But in recent times, some charities grown tired of the Duchess alarmed a little and was forced to reprimand her paternally.
Used to find his wife submitted, away from all ambition, entirely alien to the success of his speculations, treated as a girl, but as a faithful dog who occasionally runs his hand over his head.
Never had hindered that unhappy lady, or their work or their vices.
Although his beloved, his erotic antics in the order were known around the world, Ms Carmen or ignored or pretended to ignore them.
However, the last Duke's infidelity, the relationship Tell them the Amparo brought trouble.
Dominant woman delighted in vejarla foul a thousand ways, something I had not done any of their predecessors.
On the tour, when he went with her husband in the car, the Amparo stood at his side with the former florist brazenly cynical Duke smiles changed over intelligence.
When the good lady complained gently of this procedure, Salabert flatly refused, not just their looks and smiles, but every relationship with that woman.
I did not know by sight.
In the theater Real as well.
Amparo persisted in watching all night to the Duke's box.
Then in the bulls, horse racing, sporting a scandalous luxury strongly calling public attention.
Some well-meaning friends, never missing a lot pitying Ms Carmen learned of the massive expenses that cost the Duke woman, all extravagance and caprice.
This series of pinpricks suffered in secret, without committing to anyone but her confessor, had carved lady's health, reducing it to a state of weakness so that by some miracle was sustained.
Salabert had more to do to repair in such suffering.
Ms Carmen looked up smiling. - Hello is that you?
Miracle, for here at this time. - Before he had come to hear from you, if I had said that he was the father Ortega.
Without a bit of black cloth, palaces freshly painted like this scream too ....
Only eventually become bothersome: never tire of asking.
They have so many swallows as whales ....
I would buy good figurative wins, wax or cardboard, and would the same effect .... - Hush, hush, Antonio, do not begin to piffle.
He was referring to the nursing home, which was Ms Carmen's chief protector. - It's going really well.
Only the Marquise de Alcudia not want to continue being treasurer.
Do not know who is to be appointed. - Of course, that depopulate Saturdays. - What then? - Innocently asked the lady. - Because they all leave for Sevilla on broomsticks. - Bah, bah!
Do not make fun of the elderly poor - said laughing -.
You and I are also two old .... - True, true - the banker said smugly getting serious and sad -.
We are a couple pitfalls that one of these days we slipped to another neighborhood without feeling.
He had seen a timely input to the conversation I wanted, was quick to seize it. - No, you are strong and robust.
You can still give a lot of trouble in the world ....
But I, dear, and I have one foot in the stirrup. - They both have, both.
In the past sixty days there is no insurance .... - If those thoughts you used to remember more of God and His holy service work, I am glad that you had. - Do you think that not enough work for him, and every year brings me more than five thousand dollars on masses and novenas? - Come, Antonio, do not talk like that! - My daughter, well think it is there, but it is also wise to think what happens here ....
Look, these days I was just imagining that if one of us die, which survived him many entanglements would .... - Why? - For the husband and wife are heirs of each other, and, of course, if we were to die without a will, our relatives would come to disturb that remain. - It is easy to remedy.
With it is arranged. - Precisely what I thought - Duke said panting a lot to show indifference and poise, she did not feel -.
He had thought that rather than test each one by hand, we did a mutual will. - What is that? - A will in which we mutually instituted heirs.
Ms Carmen looked down at the book he had in his hand and was silent a moment.
So it I have already promised.
Salabert encounter did not believe that obstacle.
Judged thing done about the mutual will.
It was as shocked as disturbed.
But instantly recovering himself, took a continent serious and worthy to say - Okay, Carmen.
I do not try to impose my will to yours.
You own to leave your property to whomever you like, even if these goods have been won by me at the expense of many jobs.
Over the years we've been together, issues of interest have never produced no quarrel between us.
The money compared with the affections of the heart, has no value.
The only thing I regret is that another person even if he is a beloved daughter, I have hurt so much in your love, me been banished from your heart ....
As he uttered these last words his voice was altered slightly. - No, Antonio, not - be quick to say Ms Carmen -, or your daughter and no one can tear the love belongs to you ....
But consider that you are rich enough without my money, and that she needs. - No, do not try to disfigure ....
The blow is given, I feel it in the bottom of my heart - said Salabert in pathetically touching his left side -.
Thirty-five years of life marriage, thirty-five years sharing sorrows and joys, fears and hopes, not been enough to conquer the first place in your affection.
I thought our marriage, life of happiness and love that we have so many years, was closed by an act which summarized the heir of that together We won ....
The affection of husbands never better demonstrated than in the last will ....
Salabert's speech took on a tone of moral uplift that seemed to worry for a moment his wife.
However, finally said softly and firmly at once: - Although I have not been in my heart, I want to Clementina like my daughter, the I have always regarded as such.
It seems an injustice to deprive a child of their share of inheritance. - But woman! - Eagerly exclaimed the duke - for whom I want what I have but to my daughter?
Let me his heir, and I will pass it intact and even promise to increase ....
Ms Carmen paused merely to make a negative head.
The Duke up as if seized with a violent emotion. - Yes, yes, well I understand.
Okay: meets your revenge, but he knows that I have not really wanted any woman more than you.
At the heart not sent, Carmen, and if I want to boot heart, my heart would say: "No, you can I boot it without breaking ...." It's sad, very sad to bring to life this terrible disappointment ....
If you were to die tomorrow you what God does not consent, many disappointments, many I expect penalties in addition to the loss of a beloved wife!
Perhaps this poor old man saw pointed out the house where he lived, that has made her dream to die in the arms of his wife.
The duke's voice at times altered, his eyes filled with tears.
Still continued in this pathetically for a while.
Finally fell as faint in the chair, taking the handkerchief eyes.
But Ms Carmen, though charitable and sensitive, gave no signs of being shaken.
Previously, steadily, he said: - Well you know that none of that is true.
I can not avenge, nor would it be strong revenge all I have to leave your daughter, which only is mine for the love I have.
The Duke changed his tactics.
He looked for a while his wife with compassion.
Finally he said smiling bitterly - You want a lot to Clementina, right? ...
Well look, the best you can do to give a great joy is burst the sooner.
Osorio is with the poor in smoke.
Now I understand why creditors do not just swallow
