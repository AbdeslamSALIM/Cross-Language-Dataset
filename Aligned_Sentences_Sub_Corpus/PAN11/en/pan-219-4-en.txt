In time, some were gathering EFTE Marifco by corners, i entries Mar, where the Indians on the two occasions that gave them, they killed Ten men, à vifta of Real, so that pudiefemos focorrer, And when they find, from à part pafados with arrows, although some had good weapons, no refiftir BAFTA, to no faith efto hiciefe, with arrows so deftreça, i force (as I said above) à i said, i swear nueftros Pilots, defde the Bay, which pufimos Name Cruz, hafta here, i traveled two hundred eighty leagues, little more, or less: in all we saw Earth efta Sierra, and we learned of it in any way: i before we embarcafemos, so the The Indians killed us, faith more than forty men died of disease, i hunger.
A i twenty two days of the Month for September had eaten faith Horses that WNV is folo; i EFTE efta day we embarked on order.
That the Governor's Barca i were forty nine Men.
In another, he gave the counter, i Comifario, would many others.

The other gave the Overseer, i i to me with forty-nine men, i defpues of the Baftimentos board, i clothing, it is not the boats over vn moans out of the water board: i beyond the efto, we were so tight, we could not move, i so can the necefidad, we venture to go hico efta so, i get into so trabajofa Mar vna, i finally have news of Art scored any of which there were.
That Bay of where we started, has named the Bay of Horses, i walked for days Fiete those Lighters, entered the water hafta tape, Final order to see any crow's COFTA; i after they reached an island that eftaba near Earth.
My Barca went ahead, i saw it coming five canoes of Indians, the defampararon quale i dexaron to us hands, seeing that we were going to them: the other boats pafaron later, i gave in VNAs Mifma CAFAS the island, where we found many beverages, eggs i them that eftaban feces, mui was great remedy for necefidad we had.
Defpues's taken, pafamos forward i two leagues away pafamos Eftrecho vn that the island toward the Earth, the call qual Sant Miguel, haver falido in day for the fu; i falidos, we reach the COFTA, where with the five canoes, which I havia taken the Indians, remediate some of the boats, making sills of them, i added, so that two feet of board fubieron fobre Water; i with efto walking around by luengo of COFTA, via del Rio de Palmas, CREFC each day the fed, i hunger because mui Baftimentos were few, i would mui done, i Water faith has just because the boots, which hecimos the legs of the horses, then they were rotten i order no avail: sometimes entered by Ancona, i BAIAS, which came much Earth in all baxas find, i peligrofas: i walked by them thirty amphi days, where sometimes Hallab Pefcadores Indians, poor people, i mammals.
After ia of eftos thirty days, that was necefidad eftremo Water, near COFTA iend, vna Canoe come paired against vna night, i like the saw, efperamos that llegafe, i do it not Quifa face: and though the call, not Quifa Bolvar, or wait, i per fer night, not Feguer, i fuimonos nueftra via; Quando amanefciò, vna saw small island, i went to her, to see fi should find water, but nueftro work was in vain, because the havia.
Eftando there Furter, Storm vna mui took us great, because we stopped feis days, so that Flair à OFAF the Sea: i like havia five days, did not drink, the Fed was so great that we pufo in necefidad falada drinking water, i some faith defatentaron it so much that we killed fupitameete faith five men.
Afi efto story short, because i do not think it's particularly necefidad miferias count, i work in that we were, because where eftabamos confiderando, i efperança remedy the lack of which had, each WNV can Penfed much that there pafaria; i saw the Fed as crefcia, Water i kill us, but the Storm was not cefada, we agree Nueftro entrust to God the Lord, before i venture to the danger of the Sea, which efperar the certin death, the Fed gave us, i afi falimos the track, where havia vifto Canoe, the night that we came there, i EFTE day we were often flooded, i so lost, that none huvo, not tuviefe by certain death.
Plug to Nueftro Lord in the fuel necefidades moftrar maiores fu favor, which they returned vna puefta Punta del Sol, Earth to do, where we found many Bonanca, i coat. À nofotros left many Canoas i Indians, which they came, we talked, i wait so loving, faith they returned.
Was Great people, well i difpuefta, i did not bring arrows, or bows.
I went Figuer Nofotros fus hafta CAFAS that there eftaban close to the language of Water, Land i missed it: i front of the CAFAS find many pitchers of water, i too much of PEFC guif, i the Lord of those lands to the Governor ofrefciò everything, taking it i config, it was fu Cafa.
The CAFAS of eftos were efter, that what were eftantes parefciò; i defpues that Cafa enter the Cacique, we were very PEFC nofotros i gave him the Corn, he had, i ate it nueftra PREFERENCES, i asked us again, i gave it faith, I gave the Governor many Refcates, the qual, eftando with Cacique in Cafa fu, half an hour of the night, fupitamente Indians were in nofotros, i where mui eftaban ill, lying in the COFTA, i rushed CAFA also the Chief, where the Governor eftaba, i was injured in the stone VNA roftro.
Those who found faith there, seized the Chief: but as eftaban Suios so close foltòfeles, i dexòles in the hands Blanket Marthas vna Cebelinas that fon the best ones I believe that faith in the world could find, i have the odor vn, not fine parefce Ambar, i Musk, i reach as far away, that too much faith fiente: others saw there, but no were such as eftas.
Those who found faith there, seeing the wounded governor, put him in la Barca, i hecimos recogiefe faith that with more people all boats fus, i hafta stay fifty on Earth, for against the Indians, who attacked us three times that night i with such impetus that made us increasingly delayed more than a stone's throw vn: none huvo of nofotros, quedafe not hurt, i I was on the face, i found little faith fi and Arrows, eftuvieran most profitable of them, so we did a lot of damage culprit.
The faith once vltima pufieron Captains Dorantes in ambush, i Peñalofa, i Tellez, with fifteen men, i gave them by efpaldas, so i made them flee, we dexaron.
The next morning I I broke more than thirty canoes, which took us to North vn to, that for all eftàr huvimos day of very cold there, so OFAR enter the Sea, by the great storm havia therein.
Efto pafado, we turn to board, I sailed three days: i like havia taken little water, i the Vafos we had to carry were mui afimifmo few tornadoes fall into the first necefidad; i Figuer nueftra via, for vn we efter, i eftando in him, we saw vna Canoe Indians: as we call them, came to nofotros; i the Governor, Cuia à Barca havia arrived, he entreated her water, i ofrefcieron them with them when Dief the traxefen; i vn Chriftiano Greek, called Doroteo Teodoro (whose faith hico above mentioned) he said, he wanted to go with them: the Governor, i tried other faith what eftorvar much, i never they could, all CAFOs fine wanted to go with them: afi faith was, i vn Configo Black bears, i dexaron Indian hostage two fu Company; i à Indian night they returned, i traxeronnos Water Vafos nueftros end, i do not they brought the Chriftianos, which led havia i which havia forsaken for hostages, as others spoke, quifieronfe take to water.
But those who detained eftaban la Barca, i amphi faith were huiendo Canoe Indians, i dexaron us confufos mui, i Trift by haver lost those two Chriftianos.
In Melee, they gave us Indians.
When morning came, came to nofotros many Indian Canoes, asking the two Companions Barca in the havia been for hostages.
The Governor said he, daria faith, with which traxefen Chriftianos the two, which led havia.
People came to efta five or feis Gentlemen, i us People parefciò fer rather difpuefta, i of more authority, I show that there havia hafta vifto, though not as big as the others, who told havemos.
They wore their hair fueltos, i mui long, covered with blankets i Mart, the strongest of that back havia taken, i some of them made by mui eftraña way, because in them havia VNOs Laços of tawny fur VNAs work that parefcian mui well.
Rogabannos, fuefemos with us them, i would give us the Chriftianos, i water, many mastheads i: i contino flocked fobre nofotros many canoes, trying to make the mouth of that post: i afi by efto as because the Earth was mui eftàr peligrofa for it, we falimos à la Mar, where eftuvimos hafta noon with them.
And we do not give the Chriftianos quifiefen, i for ETFE refpeto nofotros Dief were not the Indians, throwing stones començaronnos Hondas, i Varas mueftras arrows, although we did not see them all fine three or four bows.
Eftando in efta race, the wind refrefcò, i them faith they returned, we dexaron i: i afi sail that day, hafta Vifperas time that my Barca, who went before, defcubriò vna tip, which Earth to, i the other end via faith vn mui Rio Grande Isleta i vna than to the tip, I did Furger, by efperar the other boats.
The Governor Quifa not arrive, put faith before by vna mui Baia near there, where many islets havia, i got together there, i defde the Mar Freshwater take, because the Rio entered the Sea of ??avenue: i for some corn Tofta what they had, in that the havia two days we ate it raw, we miss on that island, but as we did not find firewood, we agreed to go to Rio, which eftaba behind the tip, vna League alli: i walking away, such was the power, we do not in any way come dexaba before us away from the Earth; i nofotros, working, i stubborn to take it.
North, who came Earth, began to CREFC So that got us into the Ocean, so that nofotros pudiefemos make another crow: i half a league we were stuck in it, backgrounds, i find that with were unsuccessful in taking thirty fathoms deep, i could not understand, fi CAUF that the current was pudiefemos not take, i afi sailed two days, still working to make Earth: i to out of them, vn shortly before the Sun faliefe, we saw many chimneys by COFTA: i work to get there, we found ourselves in three fathoms of water, i per fer night, Ofama not take Earth vifto havia because as many chimneys, we believed that we could recrefcer faith any danger, nofotros order to see, by much obfcuridad, havia what to do: i determined by efto of efperar morning, i like amanefciò every Barca faith itself is lost from the others: I find myself in thirty fathoms; i Figuer my voyage, à Vifperas when I saw two boats, i like I went to them, I saw that the first to arrive was the Governor of the qual I wonder, that parefcia me that we should do?
Yo I said to him, which was to recover that Barca, who went before, i in no way dexafe, i that all three boats together, figuiefemos nueftro way where God quifiefe carry.
The refpondiò me, that this faith could not do, because Barca mui was tucked into the sea, and he wanted to take the Earth, that fi i loved her I Feguer, which hiciefe than my Barca tomafen Rowers, i trabajafen, because of brace force of faith havia take the earth: i efto vn aconfejaba him Captain, which had Configo, whose faith called Pantoja, telling him that fi that day did not take the Earth, which would not take other feis, i ETFE necefario time was starving.
Fu vifta I will take my Remo, i did it mifmo all in my Barca eftaban for it, i hafta CAFI bogamos puefto the Sun: but as the Governor had the most fana, i brunt People, that among all havia in any way you were unsuccessful in Feguer, or hold her.
I, as I saw efto, pedile that so that we can Feguer, vn Dief me out Barca fu: i refpondiò He'd do them a little, that night pudiefen Folos fi get Ground.
Yo I said to him that it via the little pofibilidad, in order havia nofotros Feguer, i do what havia commanded dixefe me, that was what I ordered that hiciefe?
