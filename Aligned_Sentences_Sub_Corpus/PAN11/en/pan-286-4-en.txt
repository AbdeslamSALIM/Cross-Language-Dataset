It wasn't a historical work, or biographic, that was traced and projected, but a square of traditions and living paint or a loyal picture of what we have today in each province in its use, culture, ideas, and more clothing, conditions and acts of the women.
And being the situation like that, I repeat that I was not aware of anything or almost anything that would stop the monotony of the work by the object, although by the subject, or I'll say instead, by the subjects, came to be a garden of flowers, like the cape of a student, merciful to the diversity of styles and to the idiosyncrasies of each writer that would put its hand on it.
Like so, although less more or even less, I wandered, when family duties took me to riñón to the province of Córdoba; and a joyous province where the local provincial color is released with full hands by lavish nature and inexhaustible in its various creations.
I was persuaded that if the Cordoba that I painted was not his type of genre, it was because I did not know how to paint what I was seeing in a very clear manner.
I decided later, since then, to make that picture, confessing with ingenuity that, if it does not turn out new and original, the fault would be mine and not of the model.
One thing bothers me still, and makes my goal difficult.
The disparity between the memory and the present impression always confuse me a bit.
