Henbane has some importance in the treatment of certain transfers that have more mental and less erethism passibility in the effects of belladonna, but moral and nervous phenomena are almost similar in form.
We talk about hobbies furious, from the melancholic, the lipemanía with silence and continuous apprehension when there is constipation, agitation at times and photophobia.
Encephalitis in children in the exudation period, calls from the time henbane acuity of completion and belladonna and is not indicated, when the eyes are prominent and turbulent and there is no irritation from the first period is characteristic of zinc, aconite and belladonna even or jimson furious delirium, or the continuing resolution of muscle forces that are noted on the digital.
Mercury is a powerful auxiliary henbane in these cases, and even better in consecutive paralysis of the meninges.
Henbane is effective in the last period of puerperal fever with suppression of lochia, nervous delirium, general pallor, slight convulsions, be alive.
In general, the suppression of lochia and its excess, require this medication, just as the suppression rules and clear blood metrorrhagia.
In the suppression of the lochia is a subdelirio accompanied by horrific visions, pallor and inertia of the fiber that difference of belladonna.
When there is excess flow also shows the inertia of the fiber, general spasms, gradual weakening of the senses, increasing the flow to each convulsive shock, both loquial as menstrual.
These various symptoms differentiate their action of ipecac and rye ergot.
Whooping cough, dry, and purely nervous, and a row of pneumonia, especially if you have or increases at night, is more typical of Bethlehem, the chamomile.
In these Pertussis cases and is often necessary to repeat the dose. = Dose .=-- Henbane is administered at the dose and the way the aconite, the aloes, belladonna.
Ignatia (SAN IGNACIO BEAN .-- IGNACIA). § I. - History.
Murray has collected all the observations relating to the first.
Jaerg and Hahnemann the have experiments.
We can say in general that the ignacia has properties very similar to those of Walnut vomica, with the difference that the former has more instability phenomena in nerve and less strongly affects the organs of circulation.
Hahnemann did not appear to has had full reason to say that this product is particularly suitable for treat acute illnesses, if such are defined as febrile illnesses.
It is true that generally speaking, are not suitable for chronic diseases, that his specialty is spasmodic nervous affections, or its exacerbation, and fevers dependent slow of a moral boost or nervous, but even in this case, whatever you want efficiency, need the competition or drug help more fixed and lasting action.
The relationship is ignacia as nux vomica, with gastric diseases nervosa, the condition that their symptoms worsen in the morning rather than evening, and recognize because one regret, and moral causes depressing, rather than anger and emotions sudden.
The ignacia sometimes produces joy and good humor, and other diseases sad , sentimental, and with more frequency, fast alternative hilarity and tearfulness.
The medicine and nux vomica have pathogenetic effects in pain dislacerantes and cramping, aggravated by touch, motion, for the outdoors and the application heat.
The ignacia work on the spinal system, while also altering why nerves ganglion and these viscera and chest, digestive organs and the venous system; but losing its activity, the more it is separated from the spinal nerves, and ceasing to therefore be similar to the nux vomica in its influence on the venous system and gastric which it follows that their action is more nervous and less extensive.
This action essentially Nerve ignacia expresses himself by a remarkable variation calorification unequally distributed, variation and change to the provisions Este moral.
However, gastric symptoms and which expresses the extent of medical action nutrient to life, are fixed and permanent.
Not without interest to observe, with a teacher Vienna therapeutics that these same conditions are specific to gastric ignacia, especially in persons of a lively and fresh, as opposed to requiring the nux vomica.
Moral status in harmony with the changes produced by Ignatius in the healthy, temperament is nervous and frail, and also that of the sensitive and deeply impressed by a love or even annoyed.
Gastric ailments resulting from these moral causes, which generally concentrate their action in schools epigastric correspond directly to the action of Ignacio on the same centers and make this drug is quite effective in diseases caused by affliction and sorrows, and even play in gastric and neuropathic conditions resulting from a thwarted love or unhappy.
This medicine is thus more typical of nervous temperaments and delicate constitutions and sensitive to the blood or lymphatic temperaments, it is also the versatility convulsive nervous diseases of children, especially if nutrition is impaired; , then, occupies a place among the ignacia chamomile and ipecac.
Its action is more beneficial in children affected with the dentition, and people hysterical or very sensitive and impressionable up the excess. § III .-- therapeutic effects.
Conditions typical of Ignatius are, in general, or catarrhal intermittent: the chills and the heat is unevenly distributed, thirst occurs more in the cold during the heat symptoms are observed and even gastric mucosal vomiting, constipation, cold interior heat in the skin, anxiety agitation which requires a change of position at every instant, sudden dizziness, pain in the viscera contusive, weakness and depression.
In fevers intermittent, sometimes the heat is great, but with the character that makes him nervous Dry and varies the redness of the cheeks, the gastric symptoms, as well as feeling of emptiness in the stomach that accompanies them, are more pronounced during the accesses.
In catarrhal fever, aches contusive are quickly replaced with lancinating erratic and fast, the cough is dry, even when fluent coryza, and is produced by a internal irritation, a tingling sensation in the trachea.
In people nervous always seen twitching and even convulsions in children.
Ignacia is administered after eyebright when the cough is presented for access and is continuous throughout the day, that remains moist coryza, especially if symptoms of angina.
It will chamomile after the febrile diseases of childhood, when spasms have been reported, and symptoms of reaction have lost their sharpness or that The excitement has given blood.
The ignacia is also referred to allay spasms anxious to remain at the beginning of a fever mucosa, after aconite and chamomile.
The ignacia is preferable to the henbane and hemlock, where bluetongue is less coughing at night that day: the first is more related to the lining of the bronchial irritations with rattling mucous and hoarseness.
The lime sulfur and eyebright extends its action to the conjunctiva irritation in the period, which soon passes, and one of his characters is always the hoarseness.
The ignacia is indicated in bilious colic with dysenteric stools or constipation, if there is great nervous irritability.
Its action is generally useful in gastric neuropathy and uterine aroused the sympathies of the nervous system and even the circulation ratio, febrile movements which dominates the nervousness.
Chronic constipation is erethism nervous or call in people willing to erratic and highly irritating sensitive, yields Ignacio, often repeatedly.
The irregularity of the rules, but with excess menstrual flow in women hysterical or very nervous, requires the use of ignacia: in these cases, changes were seen in various sensitivity, such as nail hysterical, migraine, toothache, various neuralgias, spasms, the ball almost always hysterical, anxiety, palpitations, puffs of heat in uppers, partial and no uncomfortable heat steadily.
No cracks in the anus, itching, throbbing, constricting pain: these are linear, shallow and together, usually with exudation.
The marum and sulfur may be necessary auxiliary to the ignacia.
The espigelia is also indicated in pruritus these species when they occur after a fever or that occur during the course of a fever verminous, and have been sympathetically aroused anxieties palpitations, nervous disorders generally. 5. º conjunctivitis in some children and adults, when the conjunctiva tumeface forming a bun and investing outwards.
Only in this circumstance and before hypertrophy the lid margin is when should the ignacia, is the drug most useful in ophthalmia of newborns, when developing conjunctival impeller.
The ignacia plays little skin conditions, but is useful as an accessory in the intertrigo, in erythema of the members in sensitive or nervous persons, and particularly in a species burning itch that occupies most of the skin and disappears after scratching.
Conditions it is more advantageous and more often useful this drug, its elective action the spinal nerves are neuro, neuralgia and spasms, whose characters go to indicate.
The ignacia and ipecacuanha are very similar in body spasm with stiffness, stretching, spasmodic jerking of the limbs, and movements in the muscles of the face, but is more ignacia in particular, congestion shooting in the head, pale alternative and redness of one cheek, and the irregularity in the distribution of heat.
The action of this drug in the spinal cord seconded by which also owns about ganglionic nervous system, makes it effective in spasms caused by indignation Fast concentrations in this system, and the regret that occurs from the beginning a chronic.
In these cases, every emotion of regret or disappointment or renewed spasms access seizure.
When Belladonna is preferable for the congestive symptoms of the brain, ignacia advantage can happen in similar circumstances, for example, eclampsia with repeated convulsion of the muscles of the face and spasms in the esophagus.
Ipecac plays In the same affection with diarrhea, the jimson weed, when the phenomena are more nervous brain that blood, rye ergot, if there is tremor or contraction of various muscles, jump Tendon and shortness of breath.
The migraine that corresponds to ignacia depends on a spinal irritation, excepting that of People them extremely irritable, and always accompanying spasms.
Headaches and teeth, neuralgia of the limbs and trunk, whether rheumatic or not, require ignacia when and how sudden bursts of pain.
Differ little from those of espigelia and phosphorus, without the tension and regular constipation without the aggravation of pain by heat, without relief by changing position without some periodicity in their appearance, without the influence of some causes, such as fear, noise, alcohol, coffee.
The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis the common claim in the subacute period ignacia or apyretic.
This drug is probably effective in some mental dispositions, characterized by disgust for all, by indifference, shock, general debility, and that depend on grief, mortifications and chronic or repeated shocks.
It is important to note that symptoms ignacia are entities claiming the resentment and indignation, as well as contraindications to joy and pleasure.
But do not insist on its therapeutic use, although many symptoms make it advisable in other conditions, because the clinical observation is incomplete, and because it has not yet used enough. = Dose .=-- The pilot unfamiliar with this medicine may be used at the dose of one to four drops of the tincture, or first dilution in water.
But their frequent use and the need be elected by the similarity of their symptoms tend to prefer a drop or a few cells the third, sixth or twelfth attenuation in five or six tablespoons of pure water, given at short intervals, every four or five minutes, in cases of spasmodic affections or neuralgic.
IODIUM (IODINE). § I. - History.
Introduced this metalloid in the medical field almost in our days, already enjoys great celebrity.
Recommended first, and with reason, in the goiter, soon it spread its indication to all infarctions nodes and glands, also to be so after the many accidents Secondary syphilis is in order today as a panacea for many therapeutic, filling himself a newspaper.
It is fair to agree on the truth of the utmost importance that iodine has conquered.
Invaded We are today a multitude of organic disorders in a triple way threaten future of all families, secondary and tertiary syphilis, tuber and scrofula, three diathesis that profoundly affect the economy and the organic cell, and that the iodine appears must modify more advantageously than any of the medicines in the materia medica old who have resisted the routine, esclusive systems and modern skepticism.
No we admire because of its high clinical fortune.
But the confusion and doubts that have arisen in our time in the reports and the Academy [4] on the effects of iodine, and indications, prove how great is the ease with which we have proceeded in the frequent use of this medicine.
Certainly you can ensure that if they were a severe test of the entire medical field former, few drugs would no longer produce the same confusion in the appreciation of its physiological and therapeutic effects.
In this way it would come to recognize that the law of such a principle is not negligible, and that the work of Hahnemann and medical, school or his followers supporters of other methods have been dedicated to Experience " formal, are of great importance.
Iodine compounds are known: barium iodide, iodide of calcium, iron, the protoyoduro potassium or potash hidriodato, iodides of mercury.
The hidriodato of potassium salt of iodine is the most used and which relates to what we say about this simple body.
Its action differs only by the lower activity and milder effects and more graduates.
The action of iodine on the nervous system is fleeting and inconsistent in principle, but the modification induced on the node innervation and liquids, ie their Dyscrasic effects, alter the nervous system of the life of relationship to the point of producing neuralgic symptoms that correspond with sufficient accuracy to which expresses the diathesis scrofulous and syphilitic mercurial, such are wandering pains in the joints, lacerations in them and even members at night, feeling of heaviness and trembling in them, muscle tremors, staggering gait, great weakness, and in particular, cramps fingers, pain in the arms osteócopos pains to disturb sleep, convulsive movements and tremors of the arms and hands, numbness of the fingers of these, pain, heaviness, paralytic weakness of the legs, cramps in the feet at night.
The circulatory system undergoes a first alteration which is fully excitants characterized by increased heat in the skin blood turgor communicating a burgeoning health aspect; hard, fast heartbeat, ninety beats, headache and congestion into the gravatar head and the larynx, chest, heart, stomach, intestines, tightness and coughing bloody sputum.
This initial excitement is replaced by increased secretions; by passive congestion or subacute; by local irritation of the mucous membranes eyes, nose, larynx, of the genito-urinary, for a state gastric characterized by heartburn, nausea, vomiting, difficult digestion, colic, development gas, irregular bowel movements, for violent and momentary palpitation of the heart .....
If you continue the use of iodine, soon more and more altered digestion, blood becomes more serous, the skin takes on a dirty, sticky sweat, weak pulse, the veins are filled with a rich blood poorly crafted items, fat and other substances absorbed, its walls weakened distend, the veins swell, the weakness increases muscle tremors occur in the limbs, anxiety, easily frightened, painful dreams.
Marasmus is notable, they disappear glands to adipose tissue and are absorbed; secretions increase simultaneously, and become more copious mucous flow, sputum, diarrhea, leucorrhoea, etc..
The nervous system takes great irritability, and occurs, Finally, a state erethism with diminution or suppression of the secretions, continuous fever and more often sender, swelling and bloating of the abdomen, constipation, impressionability fiber and sense organs, depression, anxiety, extremity weakness .....
Hahnemann thus summarizes the symptoms that indicate iodine [5]: numbness in the morning, throbbing in the head, itchy eyes, ringing in the ears, disecea, coated tongue, salivation, taste like soap in the mouth, belching, acid burning, heartburn after ingestion of undigested food, ravenous hunger, nausea, flatuosidades, constipation, urination in bed rules delayed, chronic cough in the morning, difficulty breathing, swelling of the exterior neck laxity of the arms in the morning in bed, numbness of the fingers, twist bone, skin dryness, night sweats.
After these symptoms that Hahnemann refers to try this medicine, he could add the following table: pain and irritation throat, fluent coryza, lacrimation, and dryness or irritation of the mucous and sluggish flow mucous, acne pustules especially on the face and back, shake hands then extends to the whole body.
