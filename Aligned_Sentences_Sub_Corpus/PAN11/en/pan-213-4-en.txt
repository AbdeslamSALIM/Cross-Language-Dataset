The second queen is Christ, and with it the compassion and also love, but love mixed with mortification, penance, fasting, tears, vigils and even flogging, all of which Mr.
Gener like little or nothing.
But fortunately, and that Mr.
Gener is pleased, the third rule is soon to start at least we realize it.
Will the reign of the Holy Spirit, that is pure love, not disciplines and without abstinence, without hair shirts and no scraps, but all delight, feast and Gaudeamus relentless.
Gener want that much of what he says is true or limited to a symbol, allegory, image or figure of speech in vain?
Anyway, even if symbol and not really something that Mr.
Gener us in his magnificent painting paintings, still can and should we peer into the hidden symbol in it actually contains.
Now, if it is true, as Mr.
Gener said, with talk at the same Eternal Father, this is not true provident and providence is that of man, Nietzsche reason, and do not have Mr.
Gener God says in his long speech, that good and evil you are indifferent; he is limited to producing life, and that if you create flowers, beauty and health, tasty fruits, innocent pigeons and doves, butterflies and dragonflies and cute and painted birds that sweetly warble and chirp also creates tigers and hyenas, spiders deformed, poisonous scorpions, earthquakes, hurricanes and pestilence and prolific variety of microbes, because of the more disgusting and deadly diseases.
Such is the God who speaks with Mr.
Gener and declares that it is not for us neither savior nor provident.
Gener says by the mouth of the Eternal Father he imagines, turn the venom balm, pain pleasure, roses and thorns microbial pathogens in pleasantness.
But if we do all this responsibility is not While we sit passively and forget our responsibility.
Gener reason to deny the providence of God, because God, by virtue of a wise plan, uses of man to overcome obstacles, to destroy evil and make him well, and we refined and improved where possible.
If there is no plan, do not know where Mr.
Gener may assert that there is progress, improvement, advent of super-men and other future blessings.
Concede that he discerned, he discovers, but it sets.
I decide not to be true or a lie, but our understanding is not absurd a broadly conceived plan and imagined, and not to represent us in a number of centuries the development and history of the entire universe, so that We represent you at least what happened on our planet since the moment he started revolve around the sun until today.
In my view, is extremely poetic idea and ingenious of atoms, driven by the itch of life that moves them, come to produce life, and that, once created life, what beautiful is completing and perfecting each again.
But who has the intelligence of atoms, not aware that understand, this itch tireless and unfailing that creates life and then the improvement?
All this is explained assuming the God who Nietzsche and Gener refuse, as sovereign and supreme intelligence as they prepare, and have rule over all.
Without it, can never conceive the human mind for many centuries used in the transformation, how can birth most of the least of which is not moving it moves, what you do not live long lives, the unconscious conscious, and what intelligence do not understand.
This is inexplicable, is contrary to reason that the most ridiculous of all mythologies, the most rudimentary and primitive of all religions.
And, conversely, does not affirm the existence of well God, everything becomes clear and everything in the transformer seems more beautiful and more consistent with omnipotence and wisdom of God than any other system cosmogony.
It's more anthropomorphic and, therefore, less divine, understand that God manages the universe as a watchmaker fixes the machinery of a clock, and gives, for example, the birds wings to fly, eyes to they see to see, and they understand understanding to understand, to understand God places on the substance, in the matter, atoms, or as we like to call a unfailing desire and movement in a safe direction, firm and without possible loss by whose virtue, creates the desire to live life, flying, wings, and seeing, the eyes.
I do not plead or otherwise supporter of Darwin.
I merely assert that Darwin did not invade the domains of metaphysics or religion, and differentiating his unfaithful disciple of Haeckel, and even more from Mr.
Gener and Nietzsche.
Bishop and Van Wedding, in its reasonable element of religion is expressed in this way. "Faith and science may agree to accept a transformer in which While respecting the notion of the creative cause of the soul and spirit and freedom. "From here it follows that even the most orthodox Catholic can be Darwinian, based on texts and Case of San Augustine, Aquinas and other Doctors and Fathers of the Church as shown, or attempts to demonstrate this, the eminent Italian poet and philosopher Antonio Fogazzaro In a recent and very interesting book called human ascents.
Does not follow, however, acceptance of the doctrine of the processor, security appear to be superman when least expected.
The most that will be inferred somewhat remote possibility of that occurrence.
By contrast, moral and political advancements, the multitude of inventions that make now more comfortable and more enjoyable life and the immense wealth of studies, and experimental and observation, and theoretical and speculative, which are kept in books and printing reports, are now easier than any one man stands out, but gave a lot of be super-man, but has less moral worth and intellectual men of yesteryear.
Few sublime can come up today a poet who has studied a lot, are not as staggering, They do not involve super-manhood as rare as that was, say, back in the primitive ages, the inspired author of the book of Job or Richie or poet who composed the hymn of the Rig-Veda, the Unknown God.
Trajan and Marcus Aurelius, despite being Gentiles are no monarch worth more than extending them throughout history.
In pure and fervent love of God, few men and creatures appear in the visible universe, it is difficult to be born and who overcomes and surpasses San Francisco de Assisi.
And if Kant, Schelling and Hegel seem deep philosophers, comprising and explaining everything, still seems superior intelligence of Aristotle through what had far fewer media.
Y when neither in Athens nor in Rome showed the core of super-men, we may expect not appear in the day or in England or France or Germany or Russia, or in the United States.
All be content and be content with being essentially the same, although momentary circumstances (for momentary must be given the secular amplitude history), these nations prevail today, they overlap and to dominate the others.
Anyway, there we will see how this explains Mr.
Gener and what most clearly prophesies In his Gospel of Life, which will appear entirely in French, and soon, and we know only the Preface and three or dithyrambs eloquent odes to loneliness, his brother Silence, and Night, fertile mother of two.
Silence is being raised, and is not well brought up, Mr.
Gener is the crowd to cast desatontarla, stirring all.
Gener is my hope fade away, to wither my desire and overthrow the faith in the super-man who was beginning to be born in my soul.
The last article of the book by Mr.
Gener, titled The hyper-positivism, should be titrated The hyper-negativity, because it denies everything, casting roll as is known, any basis knowing, all criterion of truth, any contention that there is something.
Gener goes further and doubted whether there was such external reality: nearly denied.
Your question or its negation is more radical.
Destroys not only represented, but also the theater where representation and the viewer appears the beholder.
Gener goes beyond Schopenhauer, who sees only the representation universe and will.
Gener is that the will is more than enough, which is nothing more than appearance.
Everything is thus reduced to representation, the most complete nihilism: a representation without theater without actors, without spectators, without anything substantial and real to be represented.
If after cramming and studying mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, anthropology and a multitude of subjects that Mr.
Gener been studied in a prominent, we come to stop at the end that Mr.
Gener for almost is best not to open a book or learn anything.
We no longer dare to figure out what is known as a small island in an ocean unfathomable and infinite can only cross imagination or faith.
The island itself and to us the inhabitants of the island, fall under the predicament of the unknowable: we are pure phenomena, the substance and the cause are "fiction, nonsense words.
Electricity, light, life, strength, feeling and thinking, everything is moving, no engine, no object moved and no place or time real objectives and, where and in which the object moved to move.
And in an active way, we will be comedians, poets and composers of music and dramatize our operations and our dramas.
This is the final point reached by Mr.
Gener after your studies.
Evil, or at least what I can not understand yet is how the representation has to like it or how I write something that is rendered when Mr.
Gener begins to take off the noun.
We have no word that is not impersonal, agentless and with no patient.
Vibrates see, smell, walk, eat, etc.., but do not know who eats, who sees, or who vibrates, and what is it vibrated, neither eaten nor seen.
Not only the super-man, but many men also exist or have existed and Mr.
Gener who speaks to us, Aryan and Turanian, Poles, Mongols, Romans and Greeks, no go from being a mere representation.
Is thus not really merit and scientific attitude As Mr.
Gener told in other articles of his book on the history of religions Socialism, etc.
It comes down to poetry, as the same Mr.
Gener heroically confesses.
And now I say in conclusion that, considering his book as poetry, is worthy of greater appreciation.
It is highly articulate, entertaining at times, sometimes sublime, and always rich doctrine of daring, original ideas and clear and well organized presentation of ideas Others suggested she was alert and raised in every spirit, but is poor and infertile like mine, so great rush of thoughts and so tangled skein of reasoning, which if not for fear of tiring my readers, I aquietaría me to write this article, but write a dozen, and I would still much to say.
But they say and Stay in the pipeline for not ending this paper.
The irresponsibility of POETS ON THE 'ODAS' OF D.
Eduardo Marquina Much can be said for and against the Odes of Mr.
Eduardo Marquina, but not that is a book negligible.
I give not a little to think about, to inspire in my mind certain philosophical contradictions or antinomies aesthetic and moral, which I am unable to resolve and I will present here bluntly and frankly.
Horacio weighted with great enthusiasm, in his Epistle to the rammer, the teacher under the poetry.
For it shows the right ways of living, the oracles dictate their sentences, rise the walls of cities and gather in peace the human race, subject to wise and just laws.
But this same Horace, who gives praise poetry so unique, We rarely cites Democritus statement claiming that one must be crazy to be a poet, and is expelled from Helicon who is in his right mind.
Everything is understood if we consider such madness as divine frenzy as sacred fury that infuses estrus, fixing his sharp thorn in the breast of the bard.
This, then owned of divinity, goes on to say things well above the vulgar sense, and opens to reveal mysteries our startled eyes, the light amplitude ideal horizon, the orderly succession and prescribed for future cases.
I'll settle and I aquietaría with this if all the poets who predict that teach or admonish were in agreement, but as they are not unfortunately, I sink into a sea ??of ??confusion.
So there I exclaim to myself, maybe they are crazy, really crazy, and be with his madness harmful to the republic.
That is why Plato banished them wisely of yours, either as a precaution, and based on the proverb that says: the mad with grief is sane.
Made the foregoing considerations, yet instead of seeing clear I see dark matter and contradictory.
In the beautiful eulogy that Heine made our eminent compatriot Rabbi Jehuda ben Levi of Toledo, after weighing the high qualities of a soul, one supposes that same God to create it, kissed charmed with her beauty, and the echo resounds divine kiss resonate with the immortal bard's verses Toledo.
No wonder, therefore, Levi ben Jehuda assuming so supernaturally helped and loved you, that you proclaim Heine king of the realm of thought and king, by the grace of God, inviolable and irresponsible.
The people, says Heine, can kill us, but you can not judge ever.
Thus Heine puts truly poetic work on the summit of all human approach and proclaims with great abandon the irresponsibility of the poets.
Are we to infer from here the complete disregard of the doctrine that poetry is exposed with such that poetry is true and that the doctrine is exposed to and by the grace of God?
Is further strengthened in my mind this way think, when I look at the works of other poets perhaps more radically asserted and conflicting.
I'll see if it manages to explain here cipher the result of my musings.
Without doubt, I say, the mental basis of poetry is like the mental foundation of mathematics and dialectics.
There in the human soul certain first principles self-evident, incontrovertible and unprovable, a certain idea in short, whose development is the law of thought and the science of calculation.
And such an idea is not purely sugetiva, mere form or status of our understanding, but by faith we are irresistible and we can be sure that in the minds of those beings superior to man is or may be in other worlds, and even in the same mind supreme must lie the same idea but more fully developed, comprehensive and penetrating and bathing everything in its pure light infinite and eternal.
The idea that, unfortunately, although it is in us, only limited and as the germ, and is true we do not see well what is outside us, but to reason about what out of us assume that there is construction or on the ideal of pure thought.
Hence, not affirm that this thing or that, that the whole universe, that whatever is or can be, is as we perceive or imagine it, but I imagined or perceived, or say to yourself given the course, everything is linked together, and made up a harmonious set of truths within our ideal world, although perhaps not fit or respond accurately to the real world that is outside of us, which we know very little and maybe have the wrong news by operation of the senses.
Geometer does not respond to whether or not sphere, cube or cylinder that have solid, or be circle or triangle of this kind or that what you draw on paper; than it answers is the accuracy of their theorems and certainty of its demonstrations, given the assumption.
Neither answer algebra than they are worth in reality, the problem points to be resolved, but responds only that the problem is properly solved.
When you apply to reality, it is then or has devolved before determining the value of each letter.
In my view, understanding and poetry, have an explanation and apology, not a few things that are told in verse, which, if told in prose, would appear absurd or abominable could lead to its author in a society rather severe to the prison or the madhouse.
The blame for all this lies, to me what I can see, that poetry, which aims the manifestation of beauty in a sensitive way, can only be imitating the real and real than we imagine, an element that can be error or lie.
The music, in the perfection its purity, creates beautiful, no need to imitate anything.
Meditation above all, exposed to exhaust, to sin no verbosity, has used to quiet my mind, after reading the Odes of D.
Eduardo Marquina, and to affirm, without scruple of conscience, which I think are good and true poet's work.
To grant, however, to such an irresponsible poet Heine speaks, we must not take it seriously, practical reality, the power of his poetry teacher.
Those who took it seriously Aeschylus in Prometheus Bound, assumed that Jupiter took revenge on his blasphemies directing its eagle from the air consumption falling leave a huge turtle that had been in the grip, on the glorious bald venerable playwright, and jumped the brains.
Let us therefore less so seriously Odes D.
Eduardo Marquina to leave in peace with the heavenly powers and prevent any miracle to harm you.
With this limitation it can be said that the Odes have something by way of Prometheus Bound Aeschylus, and some also, but accept them as prophecies of Ezekiel's visions and Revelation from Patmos.
Although all agree that the state of society and the world leaves much to be desired and physical evil and moral evil is no shortage on earth, I have assured that the Things are bad in our age less than in previous ages.
What happens is that the moral has been great progress in relations between individuals with others, while there has been little progress in the collective life, little in the body social, none of peoples relationships with other people.
