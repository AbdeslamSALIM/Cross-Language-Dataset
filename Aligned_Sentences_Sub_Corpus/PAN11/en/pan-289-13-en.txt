Entering shops, but not buy, just for the pleasure that I I have in all foreign nations to see and hear, to see to details, to hear the manner of expression, is learned and study.
Apart from this street, there are other very good and elegant [30], but is undoubtedly the best of that.

The description in my notes encounter is brief and concise: having just spent fifteen days in Vienna, I was arrest can be studied with as the capital has worth to be seen, however, as my only occupation in Vienna outside of sightseeing and visit the most notable, I think Vienna chapter, though short, will not contain some data and news.
The Danube, this striking and majestic river that has witnessed many battles and events as witnessed important, through and around Vienna with its waves ever turbulent.
The appearance of the river, divided into many channels and different courses and in Vienna offers not respond to the idea greatness that it is formed has not yet visited.
The streets of Vienna, with the exception of modern, are generally narrow.
The general appearance of the city is not a capital of Germany: the face of some palaces resembles rather, Italy.
There are however the odd building Gothic style reminiscent of medieval and ancient colorful provided to the city.
The most imposing and majestic church in Vienna is the San Esteban: its high bell tower dominates all buildings and rears its head high above all.
Religious thought, symbolized in San Esteban, crown all noises, dome serves and protects all ideas and sponsoring all the emotions.
Stephen is a summary of the somewhat history of Austria and his art has only started in 1100 graceful and slender could rise in 1307, using its construction over two centuries and depicting it thousand vicissitudes and memories.
Inside the church responds to the from the outside announces, is majestic and severe.
The church of the Augustinian worth being seen by more than a concept: apart from the beauty of the building, the famous Canova is there one of the best sites that has marble inspired writing chisel.
The tomb of the Archduchess Cristina, vanity magnificent mausoleum was built, gave origin, and therefore deserves and forgive, to Canova, the sculptor unrivaled deploy their talents in the work.
The who loves the arts, however little understanding of sculpture, not leave without visiting Vienna.
Another notable is the temple of San Pedro, built in 800 by Carlo Magno.
His venerable antiquity and artistic beauty attract the eye of the beholder and content of imagination, which look like a past so distant and yet so strong and robust.
In Vienna, however, dominated almost exclusively the religion Catholic, also has the good fortune to tolerate the other: There are temples for all religions, and placed one in front of others, there is indifference or hypocrisy.
The Emperor's Palace is surely one of the best Europe is modest and nothing else: in the garden on the one hand he Decorating is a statue dedicated to Francis I.
The square arms, near the palace, da front garden of the People whose title I have not understood yet, in the capital of an empire ruled with absolute form, I suppose that is what the French call a plaisanterie, although not better taste.
The main streets are the Herngasse, of Lords, the Gate of Heaven and four or five.
I called much attention to observe that quite often traveler in the streets and squares columns dedicated to the Virgin, the Trinity and other religious symbols.
I find the most expressive forms in religion actions are truly Christian, fleeing the light and sight, hiding in the sanctuary consciousness.
But anyway, like I have a unique tolerate complacency in any respect the views of others, say nothing against it, I issue my opinion only.
The greatest places I had occasion to see in Vienna are the Flour and Joseph: Both are spacious and monumental.
The traveler who likes to know what the old cities that do have different views, there are some buildings that are worth seeing.
Sources abound in squares, which is very good.
The charitable institutions are admirably understood and organized in Vienna: the poor, those disinherited of fortune, that the world scarcely deigns to look, very sweet and gentle religion of the Crucified picks affectionate and warm with love in their temples hospitals: those of Vienna leave little to be desired, are admirable.
Literary establishments in Vienna, as in Germany, attract your attention.
This part of Europe, the elegant Madame de Stael called the homeland of thought, and that is indeed the east of where we comes in light of scientific advances, a loving devoted care to collect books and literary monuments.
Vienna's main library contains 300.000 volumes but selected works of intelligence treasures and knowledge.
There, the most precious monuments that science has risen, are met: there, in the presence of so many great flow of ideas, the man understands his dignity, grandeur and high purpose for which it was created.
There Queen intelligence, sovereign of the world, there can breathe the air glory, where great pyramids rise such that signal way of the world, there are gathered heroes thinking, intelligence athletes, there is the true aristocracy of humanity, which account for coats 300.000 volumes: there is the pride of societies, future wealth and glory of the past, the honor of present age.
In the library of Vienna, philosophers, scientists and writers all climates and languages, brethren, by the relationship of soul, living together in peace: there is the best tree possible human genealogical lineage, these are the establishments that I visit with pleasure and predilection: never, in any country, I tried to see the armories, arsenals instruments of death that nothing good can say, the Libraries honor a nation, I think so, and doing a point to my involuntary thoughts, say some of the Library of Vienna.
Phoenix Works of Spanish mills, monster Lope de Vega fertility, which in Spain do not possess complete, it in the library of Vienna, occupying part of a main rooms and carefully tended.
The manuscript collection is rich and important: there are many Latino writers, Spanish, French and Italian: Taso manuscripts that the library owns are Vienna precious and of great value: the number of manuscripts enriches the library rises to 16.000.
There is also the capital of Austria five or six libraries, excellent employees at its head and numerous precious book collections.
The Museum of paintings is also remarkable: the Italian room contains paintings by Andrea del Sarto, Titian, Veronese, Vinci and others, that the Emperor of Austria has been very easy to acquire thanks to his domination in Milan and Venice.
The Spanish school is worthily represented in the museum Vienna by Velasquez, Murillo, Zurbaran and Gano, each which has bold canvases there amazing inspiration.
Van Dyck, Rubens, Rembrandt and other artists of great merit enrich the collection of tables that has gathered there.
There are six theaters that has Vienna in the city and the suburbs: the main near the square Flour, and where people sing Italian opera, not worth much, both because of the poor as its artistic significance defective construction noise.
In the months April, May and June, Italian opera season was heard in the theater Vienna good singers.
Life in the capital of Austria has something of the life of a province, it would seem that everything is there regulated, and at the hour fixed beforehand and marked all distractions must end.
The shows begin very soon, at ten o'clock night all theaters and cafes are closed, and each citizen retires to his house, the same, exactly the same in a provincial town, which is certainly not very nice.
The best ride is the call the Vienna Prater, site very pleasant, planted with trees and embellished with vicinity of the Danube.
The Prater is a reunion point very entertaining and popular, there are also various public gardens pretty good.
The theater in Vienna, as in all of Germany, is fed Translation: after Lessing, Schiller and Goethe, made extraordinary efforts to emancipate his country from paying tribute to foreign scenes, no one has up from his prostration: dramatic literature, properly that does not exist in Germany.
Apart from Austrian censorship short flight to the imagination, lack a center in Germany where there is so indispensably needs a theater there: authors, audience and actors.
In Germany, thanks to its infinite divisions into small kingdoms and duchies, all is dispersed, as the national spirit, that scarcely exists
