Be rich, be handsome, will count, will be all that the general will, though I suspect I do not know why, that must be an Andalusian gentleman, born and raised in a poblachón, lisping much, throwing it so funny, and more on purpose to shine at trade shows, dress nice, and capture the heart of the Roma and the cool, who agrees to appear as the elegant rooms, inspiring true and deep love to a young lady and make well-educated then happy.
You see, Mom, I have no reason to love your nephew and future to prefer my Greek.
And do not give me the objection that my Greek is to be a heretic or schismatic.
Fixed-that is very good Catholic.
He says that the narcissistic Greek is not natural and ever, but migratory and temporary.
What props horrible, how complicated conspiracy against a poor inexperienced girl.
Is your home and not the narcissist from which speaks to me .-- Yes? ...
Today is outrageous to me more and more insolent than ever.
Mom has been playing with the doctor sitting with the Father González.
The general advantage the chance to unleash your tongue against me: His nephew is not abominable, but adorable, that I presume too discreet and list and I'm a spoiled little child, willful and stubborn, and that if he had presented to me Narcissistic and nephew, I would have found it vulgar and ugly and had been jilted; and it has been necessary to build all the props and conspiracy, in which mother entered the general, the doctor, Father González and even Dona Rita, so I created a Greek or Turkish narcissistic and he fell in love with me.
Look here, General, please report yourself and do not insult me.
Think what you want.
You offend me by word, because it is far from me
