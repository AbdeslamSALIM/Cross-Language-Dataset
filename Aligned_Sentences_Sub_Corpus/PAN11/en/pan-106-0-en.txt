I started running like crazy, at night, taking a rag from the heart of Magdalena manojillo of flowers that had her lips and printed as I savored bites like kisses.
Walking at random, drunk with joy, repeating a phrase that dazzled me as the light of a rising sun.
I was not concerned nor the time or the streets.
After having lost ten times in the neighborhood of Paris who knew better got to the docks.
