Cultivation and processing of snuff, and the black as they call red, offers these crecidísimas peoples benefits.
This branch, which in the present state can not overtake extinct if the communities could provide high magnification, is the planting and cultivation snuff cinch to any individual who is devoted to agriculture, but the benefit after collecting the leaf is painful to those who were not free, time and proportions This, and more the benefit of black snuff for many tools that are needed.
Al same time the factory would be embarrassing to flood crops, cultivation and collection of snuff, but it would be easy profit after papers were collected, and so what should was that the Indians, and any other individuals, would go all the plantings in their own buy farms and in deep leaf seasoned pagándosela cash at a price are regulated, so that remains a modest profit to the factory, which, with appropriate tools, it would snap the benefits grow lots of black snuff and red, applying to each class was best for her.
Thus it was necessary stockpiles grew, then, almost every Indian sown, as they are many, taking freedom to work on the land so fertile, it would make good crops, which would increase by planting which in turn hiciese the factory, which should also the had.
Plantings of all the fruit supply, such as wheat, corn and all kinds of beans, the Indians would verify as they are accustomed to them, and they would buy the factory for the supply of the village.
Well is that, if necessary or helpful, could also make the factory.
To keep all these tasks, or those most accounts offer, should be in cahoots Indian laborers who were necessary for applying to the children and old to occupations that they could comply.
These laborers should be voluntary, and they would weekly pay, governs a very moderate wages, which in my mind enough not lacking for laborers and who work hard, which in the hardest-working and applied are regulated at 6 reales per week, 5, 4 and 3 to less activity, grading of each, giving them all a hearty meal at noon, boys, girls old and old enough that they reached the wages to dress and feed.
Although the inclination I know in all these Indians are not colluding and earn wages I have certainly no lack few peons need the factory to their tasks, before On the contrary, I believe that the factory would bring precision to occupy other all, if my concept come out wrong in this part, and the Indians are more applicable to their work colluding in particular to the factory, no inconvenience is that the factory would reduced its tasks only the most useful and accurate, and that they will oblige weekly and in turn the necessary laborers, paying them their wages, and that in case of non-Indians disengaged, because, having, them and not others should make clear to work as idle and vagrant people.
Shall be most desirable that the factor can be in cahoots, and conchabo, few Spanish are presented, or may be, for laborers of the rooms, chores yerbales, snuff and benefit for all occupations to be good destinations for which, when mixed with the Indians at work, teach and encourage them to work, and so it should be the cahoots some of these Spanish for foremen of the various tasks to be undertaken, although the latter should be admitted to government approval, and not otherwise.
At the end of each week should the Payment of wages that have accrued pawns in a week, according to the ballots to be given them overseers, who should be arranged and implementation assistance that each would have had that week.
All stockpiles that were made in a fruit or effects should be made weekly in stores three keys with the magistrate and butler intervention, and even the council, if it had fit, settling in a book that should exist within the same store, entries, signing everyone in it, practicing the same with the exits, and some as others should be made more in the stores, and the factor and Butler should have books individuals that enter the same items, as well as a diary that target small items in the speech of the week will be collecting or expending so that clearly stated and the purity of this management.
Inside the main house should be allocated a piece on purpose to give it a store or grocery store by a Spanish or Indian employee purpose, which is sold all kinds of edible offal of daily need, delivering account all what there was to sell and collect the money every Saturday sales surrender of the week, which should also be placed in the box store three keys, which should have to book her ticket and outflows of cash, with the same formalities as the of the fruits and effects, and every four months or when the factor would fit, would final accounts of the grocery store to know the status of her and her management, warning its result to the government.
For this grocery store was stocked with everything you should care factor, for its part, and do to look after the butler, that all the fat of cattle, and from those killed on farms and in the people, serve candle which it was made there, as well as grease from them.
That is kneaded bread, not lacking beans, corn and other edible the country produces and consumes the Indians, as well as salt, sugar, honey, soap, so they lack nothing of what might be offered, except for strong drink, they should be banned entirely, as they are by the law.
For prices of the sales hiciesen these retail grocery stores were not arbitrary the factors or store owners should be given by government tariffs, the prices fixed that were established by other duties, for purchases that would make the factory the Indians, so that selling retail could not exceed 25 or 30 percent price increase that they had bought and sold wholesale only half the retail.
The supply of meat should be in charge of a Spanish or Indian, arranged so that each res good size utility left the factory weight of silver and leather value spending of manipulators and pastors.
It would be convenient and very precise thing that the stores were stocked with adequate clothing for these people, and of those called in Castile as the country, ensuring that in the factories of paintings of peoples listadillos work, and all those who use and crave the Indians, as also no lack of brakes, spurs and any giblets know they are useful, and trying not to introduce useless and superfluous, and only Saturdays, and with the assistance of the mayor, mayor and some council, should be opened check stores and sale of these effects are of daily necessity, and the amount drop it right there in the box of three keys in the manner aforesaid, and separation other items.
These effects could increase cargársele on the main cost Buenos Aires, 40 or 50 percent, so they bear the cost of driving, failure and impairments that may suffer, and excises to be paid, and commanded to leave a good gain, for it serves in a common utility, scope and terms after be said.
A no Spanish or Indian, established or employed in the towns, which should be allowed effects introduced to sell, or even of its precise use, as everyone should buy the factory, but it will be allowed to sell the necessary licenses to individuals from outside the province to come and buy them out, even lowering price something that is regularly sold at retail to those established within it, thus increase the field of trade, and therefore the profits of the factory.
While the factory and factor wages and employment should give all those who pidiesen, and compel the justices through the idle to work, should also buy from the Indians, and even the Spanish settlers, few fruits and effects acquire with their work and industry prices that the government had established, even if There would have been any sale that they had to do for it would be something highly desirable that everyone had secured the sale of the product of their work.
Well is that the government would care to put tiny fruit prices and little effect necessary to separate the Indians from the application useless things useful by tilting the through the best prices and profits that they surrender, as we shall in the case of government.
Butler would be in charge, with the intervention, guidance and care of the factor, buying few fruits and giblets daily bring him to sell the Indians, paying in cash to set prices, to which should be in possession of some money that he take account of the end of the week, receiving and storing what they had bought, and giving enough money for the following week.
This same foremen should buy and pay the thread that the Indian hilasen and wanted to sell, fixing prices according to their qualities, in my mind should be paid to 3 reales per pound of wick, 4 of thread Thick canvas, 7 the medium, 12 the fine and 16 the superfine, and sell them in the shop real half-pound of cotton, or 10 reales the arroba, on the assumption that I buy a 8 reales the arroba of wishing to sell their crops.
The thread that are collected could be used to canvas for your grades, paying the weavers their work, as the rods and quality of parts.
The factor should be atahona to all who wished were milling wheat where so, without further payment for milling that is deemed sufficient to keep peons atahonas mules and composure, and would likewise mills, and all utensils for grinding benefit the sugarcane and honey and sugar, and, finally, all those offices would not easy coastal poor, and that lack of them or do not sow or plant those effects, the inability to benefit them or lose them for lack of them.
Should also maintain peoples immediate good portion of oxen for rent to which they needed for their crops, whether Spanish or Indian, it is that they they fix a reasonable price that will cover only the impairment of the oxen and salaries shepherds.
None should be given anything for nothing, and can work, so that each seek have oxen, horses and everything you need to save yourself from having to pay rent.
In power factor should not extinguish or money for a single day, or anything that belonged the factory, because everything would be stored under the three keys to these, and in the meantime was verified at the end of each week, which remained in the hands of Butler and others for handling, and the factor take care of their conduct, and take weekly accounts as aforesaid.
Nor should he be allowed to factor, or any other employee, taking the shop, butcher shop or store anything under the guise of charge or on credit for daily expenditures, for all I had to purchase for cash, and if he had any need, the government order and formalities necessary they could to help cash account useful part in the adjustment account has, nor were to be served of oxen, horses or other tools of the factory in their particular purposes, if not paying vacation spot everything.
Should be removed and sold, for the benefit of the factory, all the furniture and utensils kitchen and refectory, while other furniture that needed to furnishing and decorating municipal buildings, the governor's guesthouse and some others in this class, and these furniture and keep them as consejiles, ornaments destined for the same people.
The fruits marketable surplus of peoples should be issued by the factors to places where they could be more profit on its sale, particularly in capital Buenos Aires, so sold for the benefit of the factory and I refer to your product what they desired, and that this change was advantageous and was not exposed to harm and disadvantages, I think should be established in this way.
On top of its own Board and means of Buenos Aires, or who had Superiority fit, may be appointed in that city three or four subjects of quality, and suitable bonds for guardians of the people, enabling them could receive parcels from them and that they and not other factors directed farms their respective managements, but leaving them free to choose one of these agents they please, and removing the parcels when they consider useful to their interests, without need of evidence, nor the attorneys would need to excuse them to receive the parcels when they do not accommodate the receiving and takes place between traders.
And these agents were dependent and subject to the respective villages from whom they had parcels, for under its provisions, to pay the bills when they are asked and everything else concerning management that managed, meaning no Subject to the provisions and rules that have the honor to give the Superior, and other they shall speak when dealing political government of these peoples and manner in which the factors should pay their bills.
With this decision is that the attorneys would get, to keep the fees and they had, and acquire others that could added to them from other people, seek to be punctual in the performance of their duties, giving the best value for the purpose that they submitted, and buying with equity that can be ordered to, and would ensure confidence of natural factors that would make the comparison of sales and purchases of each other proxies, which can never do as a single as it has been so far to manage their estates, also avoiding the damage that would follow each village had its particular agent, as some have opined, in what I conceive that more damage has one.
For all these things observe with equal and timely in all villages was must make a statement, which clearly and minutely arranged government method economic development of each people, and serve as ordinance and other factors used in this management, which, if necessary, would be easy to train, practice and knowledge through I have of terms can be practiced and practiced.
Managed and implemented the proposed method, in my opinion would be favorable infallible result, and for the factory to the Indians, since wages were safe, and where provided all their needs, those who did not have their own crops, and those who had none security to sell all their fruit at a price fixed and determined, and the factory security grown about increases in all areas that would benefit, leaving no doubt that in a funds and people of medium proportions would not drop from 8 to 10,000 pesos annual profits, still considered the principles and tasks with only the present, what you evidenciaré with the next score.
In a village whose rooms have 20,000 head of cattle, begat of not lower 4,000 of misses a year, and having, as they all breeds of mares and mules, produced also the increase of young animals well so that I have found that by lowering those killed, lost, stolen, annual consumption of stay, and computing wages of laborers and foremen, passes for 3,000 pesos the value of the annual increase in a room like the proposal.
In a town that has 1,200 souls among young and old, does not lower the annual consumption of 2,500 cattle, and although not dealt only 2,000, whereas the remaining ones to give feed the laborers who will work on behalf of the factory, and consider a utility weight in each, according to what I have said, are 2,000 pesos.
Limited as they are in the grocery store sales of the effects of daily consumption, having to provide themselves with all the people there, not being possible that taking money from wages stop buying what they desire, can be computed gains in this sector, at least at 1,000 pesos per year.
While growing yerbales peoples are very deteriorated and are short of crops, but we can always regulate your product at 500 pesos a year, after rebates wages that can be used in cultivation and weed.
The cotton crop can easily produce the same as the grass, and even exceeded in much, if you get a little application.
The planting and benefit of snuff, and twisted like enmanojado, is a row of little use, and beneficial as we have said can be assured without risk of mistake, which would 1,000 pesos surrender the profits.
The fabrics in linen, in a village in the number of people expressed, in the day up to 16,000 beam, without nearly as many that weave dressing particularly his own; and so, but do not count but the same 16,000 yards, and they average real income in each stick to the factory, is 1,000 pesos.
The purchase of goods brought from Buenos Aires to sell to the Indians in these terms, I think it would not be less than 4,000 pesos of annual principal, at least one or two years past, which, charging them fifty percent, occur in the sale 6,000 pesos, of which 2,000 of utility, and considering that the cost of buying commission, handling and sales taxes amounted to 500 pesos, were free to 1,500.
Although there are many other peoples that make utility classes, such as benefits grass in the mountains, the cattle, cutting wood and referral, the benefit of the sugar and honey, indigo, should it be established, and many others who are targeted, I will not stop to make computation of profits give up, because for my attempt suffice implied, and that they show sufficient profits, as shown in the following summary.
Pesos Utilities begat the 3,000 rooms Idem meat consumption in 2,000 people Ditto for the 1000 general store Ditto for the herb that benefits the 500 people Ditto for 500 cotton Ditto the benefit of snuff 1,000 Idem of cotton canvas fabrics 1,000 Ditto the purchase of goods from outside the province 1,500 There are 10,500 pesos The resulting short history of free utilities to the factory, 10,500 pesos.
